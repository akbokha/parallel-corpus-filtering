<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren Anstalt where young people are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A Gruftchapel, where now is used for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardener manage the one-old reason for farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Münch promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is more nervous when maps are not currently up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">That knows everyone who had to go exciting because the car-Navi instead of a circumvent street showed a green meadow.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas of the state government, are all other than currently - but it is very enlightening.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the area-area of the Münchner Mercury in the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria atlas is a splattered canvas that one does not recognise as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">Into the large oversight-map, for cities and municipalities were more detailed cards, so-called Urpositionsblades.</seg>
<seg id="13">This arose according to the specifications of the Bayerische Staatsmeasuring management between 1810 and 1864 and originates from the first understanding of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your Customer: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French Heeresleader occupied Bavaria since the spring 1800 during the Second World War of War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon had an overview of the occupied country and gave an topographical recording of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops moved to the peace of Lunéville, from 9 February 1801, there were today's neighbours that created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph continued the project in advance, founded the" "" "Topographical Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bayerische Staatsmeasuring management." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The Urpositionsblatt for Munich dates from the year 1856 and is like all the others on the website of the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison early morning / Today is most impressive at the example of the provincial capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example of this is subjection, which appears in the map of 1856 yet relatively isolated.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was introduced 21 years after the creation of the map, so 1877, as a district of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today there is shelter in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses underlining around 1856 along the today's Plinganserstraße which was named in 1878 to Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the insurrection of the Bavarian peasants against Austria 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the West park is, you can see nothing as fields - at first glance: when hinge appears a small-disadvantaged card with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten flurns from the so-called "certificate," from which the basic tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots there are no farmers no longer - but a small resser of the complex in the sun. "</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 scene of the Oktoberfest, was in the 19th century actually a meadow - and not a concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Urpositionsblatt, one reads in the area of the current district Au-Haidhausen not just the street name "at the Gasteig" or from the jetty, "but also in large letters" Irren Anstalt. "</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the auerfield street, one once picks people with madness.</seg>
<seg id="33">There was 1858 / 59 the Munich-Irrenanstalt founded in 1858 / 59.</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudder introduced the establishment - that psychiatrist, who is associated with the death of King Ludwigs II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and ended for example the Ankettes of the so-called Irren." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">He also has allowed the personnel to apply violence against the inmates, "says Hermann Wilhelm, Head of the Museum of Haidhausen, who has worked for an exhibition with the Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients the first place was first, later it was extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sometime this capacity is no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreiserrenanstalt in the hair of 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006 the Isar-AMPER-Klinikum is located in Munich-East, one of the largest psychiatrists in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="40">At the Areal of the former Auer Anstalt you can meet young people in the Münchner Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex 1920 and walked him into a youth-home with training.</seg>
<seg id="42">Located in the west, the football field of the TSV Munich East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015 we set the kids-house "Casa Don Bosco" - in architectural approach to the origin of the Irrenanstalt who had been destroyed during the Second World War in bombardment.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was at 1856 as" "" "Head Square" "", "the Kaufingerstraße called" "" "Buy alley." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies in December 1944 a lot of holes in the city center.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small businessmen and a Gruftchapel of the Middle Ages were once at the Marienhof, where these days work the pre-bite and take place on 5 April 2017 for the second S-Bahn route.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider, the old Munich card can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil rights group published tour guide for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National association for the advancement of colored colored has issued a warning for coloured people who are travelling to Missouri because of the discriminatory policy and the racist attacks of the State.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "the NAACP Travel Advisory Board is to enter into force until 28 August 2017," "" "Afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians, while travelling through the state can take special attention and be seen in recent times throughout the country and here," "" "it is stated in the statement of the group." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it harder to win discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state, disproportionate to minorities, prompted the group to release the journey, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights that people happen." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They will hold them because of their skin colour, they are collapsed or killed, "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited like racist distortions against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died at the beginning of the year after he had no gasoline anymore during the journey and was taken into custody by the police of Missouri in custody without a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also shows a recent report by the Office of the General State of Missouri, which is shown in the state 75 per cent more frequently than wheat.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware of and their families, friends and staff informed about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people need to be ready if there are chewing money or the relatives know they are travelling through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri was reported in 2015 100 Hassle-breaking news, according to the latest figures from the hate-breaking reporting programme of the FBI, which are the state in relation to the number of such violations in the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law which would make it more difficult, a company because of housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously the American Civil War Union (ACLU) travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, published after the states of immigration authorities to commit local prosecution authorities to ban people due to immigration rules, which will contribute to further edges of the ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but in recent times stakeholders the measure have been used as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Pasture project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The fisherbacher Weidejn project is a success project and is continued next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU-Bundestag Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have shown a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the right grabenhof of the family Schwendemann the representatives of the fisherman CDU local network met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann granted first insight into his farm, in which he managed to 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 mammal and also hosts many young animals and hosts five apartments in five apartments.</seg>

<seg id="73">At the table of the holiday guests only Regionales can be found.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also called BLHV-Chairman of the fisherman, he is very important to the ordination of the Weimar project as "elementar."</seg>

<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognised the importance of the" "" "course project" "" "and is happy about the leader of the leader." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">The farmers would have to support farmers at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euro per hectare.</seg>
<seg id="81">One hope that the forestation of the surfaces could be pulled out even for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the biggest treasure that we have, are the people working in agriculture and make thoughts on how they continue their operation," "" "said Mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers stand for the promotion of often in criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The accounting surface is about 40 hectares, which may not be forested until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of 71 500 Euros, half of the leader was funded, a quarter carried the village of fishing.</seg>
<seg id="87">So they share the farmer 12 610 euro, who had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of wheat.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained swing.</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and rural women do not go."</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "also for Peter Weiss stood firm:" "" "here are the best food produced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Gailment (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state Promotion of Weidevils.</seg>
<seg id="92">The objective is the offensive of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisite is the presence of one of the LPR-signed conveyor belt.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the inocative surface may not be decelerable (Hangar over 35 percent) and must be threatened with the forestation of the forestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">For fishermen's ordination project, 2018 is currently running the application of eight participants with 24 plots that want to build up to 16 km of Zaun.</seg>
<seg id="96">The accounting surface is 35 hectares, which are calculated at more than 112 000 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is now taking the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attacking the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the careful overthrow Saddam Hussein at the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, knew certainly what he did when he took a symbolic battle with Jim Acosta by CNN about the proposals of the president for drastic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To remain fair, Miller does not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horror of the boat owners and Liberty Imitators would have turned him out if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he laid their significance, and in particular the meaning that you wrote, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta complained: "I want to go here not to a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem which you refer to that later has been added and not part of the original statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is knowledgeable, but how he formulated it himself, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary response to the emerging words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "yours guessed, your poor, / your printed masses, that will crave to breathe free, / the falling waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "miserable waste" "" "was better to see on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict with the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who put themselves in place their words after their death on the base - knew very good that they accomplished a high political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the ties between French and American republicanism by demonstrating the feminine portrayal of freedom in a unused classical portrayal of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in their poem is the feminine figure no longer abstract - it has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she has a very different name to the mother of the Exilants.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just like Lazarus the importance of the statue changed, people from the right wing wanted to change this long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great cry of the Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is nobody to load, but rather an early neo-conservative, that the American flame goes into the around the world: "Lady Liberty goes forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">She is supposed to bear the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch is not to enlighten the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is entirely and a question of the point of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus consisted in it to see them as they were by the exhaustive but hopeless people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships was seen.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people who are looking for refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue says to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Her torch is not to enlighten the path, but the hatred, which is its only source of power, ignite.</seg>

<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals-candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - which will be played against Sir Mo Farah at the 5.000 m distance while Eiliie Doyle was elected by the crew to the team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eiliie is quite modest.</seg>

<seg id="150">The Mannerts captain says that they are "enormously proud," on the fact that many of their compatriots do not only belong to the team, but in some cases also with the medals and with the finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"" "" "" "the special thing to be part of this team is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was anyway a great honour, but to know that my team mates have voted for me and chose me, makes it something very special for me," "" "she added." ""</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all those who belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as well-established athletes, athletes who want to rise on Podium.</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech as a captain concerns?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to put on these home support and benefit from it that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go there and compete, and it will just be such a great atmosphere there. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking of criticisms on Facebook: do not give you a public position when you cannot wear the intruder of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our land knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't last long until the newspapers smote him because of all, from the internal policy up to its political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He shocked at the critique, safe.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not put his critics at the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in 1783, Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, foolish and mute, we will be led to slaughter as the sheep." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who must work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans associates have blocked the posts of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil War rejected him this week in the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The rod of the governor caused the lawsuit as a frivol, and the online comment was full of a backlash with "Na, and?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type like hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican Governor in a overwhelming democratic state that is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the two-highest approval of the 50 Governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very sent to exploit Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his haunless head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blockage of persons coming to the side of the governor - which is a public forum that is called officially and by employees who are paid by public tax-Dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hoist Spreader in Amelia Chasse the actions of the governor and argued that the blockage of comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolling or spammers or water-filled people who swinging online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls.</seg>

<seg id="485">They removed the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remains of the Church threaten 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from listening.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilariuskirche was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the cherry tower could be left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year-eight 1834, a storm the storm and half overthrew one.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent a hurt, the tower was cancelled.</seg>

<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules launched in 2011 by UEFA into Life, mean that PSG eventually has to prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without big losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million Euro (262 million US $) to buy the Brazilians from his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to ten million dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can make sure that Neymar underwrites and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team through the energy of rich mistress of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Associations may apply a lot of money for the purchase of players, but they must be subject to legitimate receptions, giving them the break-up point in their way to the football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA president in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that associations in their quest for success had taken enormous debt to themselves, effectively frauds and rised to ruin when banks or owners moved their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP moved from concentration to the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, the novel Abramovich originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential and then vigorous invested to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tougher matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year period of FFP period, which runs until 2018, clubs can take losses in the amount of €30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini 2015 fallen by the presidency in Ungnade, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to cry out of excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"surely FFP is not dead and we will still intensify the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso that is responsible for the UEFA for FFP against The Associated Press in the past week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a package, it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year treaty so that the solution for the next five years can be negotiated in the annual financial statements for the next five years.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has put the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a record of 60 million euros (then 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the teams of teams for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players will be limited to the usual normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is searching for clubs that could try to oversee their financial view, by connecting their income by companies that are connected with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catalan company could see PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be considered legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">Exactly this happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the value of sponsoring the PSA was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that a part of PSG payments to Neymar could come through payments of the organizational committee of the World Cup 2006 in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar have denied that Neymar Cup Ambassador will be to be able to find out such a maneuver for the UEFA regulators.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG means that the UEFA will be more attentive to consider every attempt to deal with rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">UEFA did not have a preparatory talks with PSG on Neymars transfer, who are familiar with the situation on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They said under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, since they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 with a turnover of 542.4 million euros has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last financial year must be released.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects that Neymars arrive a blessing for Sponsoring Deals, Merchandising and Trikotpurchases.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association expects sales after the signing of at least 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players to see, and she tried to prevent Neymars withdrawal by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"" "" "" "it is a clear case of" "" "financial doping" "" "with the club and the state," "" "said the President of the La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish Daily AS in relation to Qatar's final owner of PSG." ""</seg>

<seg id="1317">The big life live: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment to a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, resized in 2014 by a large house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrasse - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne did not pack their pockets and sold.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">This apartment was shown in Earls Court and had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I love her in her and made an offer on that day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square meter has been completely rebuilt.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-bedroom property with a welded layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">This was my request, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose she studied architecture and Designstudio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, which was 12,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development but also a place to live for yodelling.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms to place each other, so that the architectural challenge consisted in creating a mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel works is quite complicated," explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were overed together without having to ask ourselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">It was not just about building a simple platform, but to attach the steel so that it had the right amount for the function above or below. "</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement made it possible to place two rooms in full height - with much extra drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine you can see a classic coupling window of Retrouvius via the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Gespiegated Goldvanity, silberne aczente and vintage Serge Mouille lighting put the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to let him seem longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirroring feel like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance we mirrored units space for all cutters and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Due to the perception of a glamourless space, the beauty of the living room can shut the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a wardrobe.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went out," explains Erfan of the steel reinforced, veneered MDF door.</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is very important, so it is when you slide the door very easily," "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage box, Joanne could win extra 16 m ², an extra bedroom and a improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the groundfloor - or how your property is estimated," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form will enter a real estate agent and perform a calculation based on the floor size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high quality materials, which give space to the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things that you touch and who therefore help create an emotional liaison in a home," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you do not love you into the electric sockets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">"" "these are important, but they do not play with your heart." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and have failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Poltico reports that the new staff of the White House is planning to restrict the information flow to President Trump, including the reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss on a uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new staff member of the White House, convened on his first working day, he introduced a main problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he would repair: poor information that fall into the hands of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in letings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Ways diagnosis makes sense, but others tries to enumerate Trump by monitoring its media control.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps relationship with television reaches decades - and now where he is in the White House is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when candidate Trump was angry because of an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair report of places that were to convince," said the former electoral consultant Sam Nunberg in February toward poltico.</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote to the time that "the key to hold Trumps Twitter custom under control, according to six former electoral campaign officials to ensure that its personal media use a steameless praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter has ever been "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps this campaign might know something that we don't know other - that Trumps Tweets would have even more ignition.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know something about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his associates didn't manage it several times, anger, anger of him, then their efforts have been worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But nobody has been able to prevent Trump Controllers.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House that advocates from competing parties, always trying to present their own agenda by promoting Trump material that may help their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the consultants, the president for strategic reasons beyond doubt.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example that was described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump-officials say that Trump can react like a volcano on negative press-cuts, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he will get out of it from where these originate.</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly this happened at the end of February, when someone called malicious a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Provokateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy staff at Katie Walsh, "the source behind a bunch of leaks to be in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was banned from Twitter, or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has expressed false accusations in the past and has taken them revoke.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began to ask staff about Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">"" "Goldmacher added that the former staff of the White House, Rob Porter," tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork, "" "" the Trump "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to prove more effective manager as priebus, but Trump is still his own self-self, and his advisers still strive for influence.</seg>

<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the agrarian Institute of CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to climate change over the past few years, which in spring has brought much less rain and in autumn a lot more.</seg>

<seg id="1810">The staff of the Weekly Riodoce is usually meeting to check their plans for reporting the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt official and ceaseless drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of her own tragedy, they came together to speak about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what are safer to feel: they should take their children to the office who were the aim of a attack with granite, or they leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a plate on the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">You ask the reporter to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and abdomen.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drugs regulators, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspects, on the pavement list of the government or cartels, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest of violence, and while in the whole country has led the corpses, more and more journalists at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto have joined in December 2012. 589 are standing by attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there were at least seven deaths in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is its editors and her inspiration from Riodoce, the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest error is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," "" "Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence will be deep receptive, although its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows his mid-finger with the word "Justice," hanging on the façade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, bear t-shirts, which show its ridiculous face with glasses or its typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporter discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although 2010 has been a Sonder BundesanBar, in order to process the cases of journalists, this according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists only introduced two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of Morden, which are connected with drug outlets and organised crime each year, the murderers of journalists are rarely placed before judgment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce, they still insist on to treat the violence of Sinaloa although they are uncomforting, and even though the terrain is still traded.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting in the discussion of security is little benefits, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"" "" "" "it is very foolish to waste my time in this workshop," "" "says he." ""</seg>

<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the provincial capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He just managed to drive a few blocks away before his roter Toyota Corolla was arrested by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelded flow."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The scorer went away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly in Culiacan freely.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans arrest in the past year and the delivery into the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, since rivaling political groups are fighting here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day anyone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery full is full of two-story mouse-oleto for drug royal that are larger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of rest assured if only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt also broken that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">At first, in February the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rivaling cartels in war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, suspected of gangsters bought every copy of the output as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kioske.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second error was to force Valdez not to force the same story after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story to leave the country for its own safety.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and its killings is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues knew that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He was active as an experienced reporter for Noroeste as he joined together with five colleagues for the creation of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to operate journalism, without reaching the anti-dowry problem," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1847">With the time the newspaper has earned a reputation because of the courageous and honest coverage, and the turnover and advertising.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved it to publish hard-hearted examinations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories, which no one otherwise dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">"" "eight years after the establishment of Riodoce she received the prestigious" "" "Maria-Moors" "" "Prize" "" "for its coverage in Latin America." ""</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drugs history, wherever they lead.</seg>

<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the Spaak-bird, who was like a port-worker, the friend, the generous with hugs and advice, a teacher, who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">You trusted on his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always travel to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and always sit at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they wonder: was his love for routine his destruction?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death has also compelled them to ask her own assumptions on how to do their work best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it if you are dealing with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret startup and runways," to employ drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even at the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-sufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="1865">To trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The anger is, said the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal that 'smell has a sense that can be danced... and then the thing happens with Javier. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others said, are not considered in Sinaloa no more - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mix of lucrative smugative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt governmental forces at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the employees of Riodoce met for security training, suddenly there were no mobile phones. days previously became known that Spyware that is sold exclusively to governments for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside two policemen protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-class quarter of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police officers, who drew the governor himself as a trusted.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week Riodoce has caught up three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">It gave the assassination of the fraction of the former known boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the government spending, concentrated on the hometown of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, one block from the office of the prosecutor, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who has been kidnapped or how it came to pass, so caution was offered to write as it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite restaurant on drug dealers and authorities.</seg>

<seg id="1938">The strongly armored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide from carnivores, and used a shielding technology that is known as counterparts that is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This could have allowed to blend better in its surroundings and soak up his enemies, say experts, which indicates that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of Nodosaurs took place in May for the first time and is now at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild beast and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli to the Museumstetechnician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours with it carefully.</seg>

<seg id="1943">They discovered the convuling, a common defence method in animal-rich, meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>

<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the teratoning - think of deer, zebras or Gürnoses - are much smaller and vulnerable to prey, what signaled that this Nodosaurs was exposed to a real battle for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong pretier behavior on a massive, strongly pumped dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs predators have to have been," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur is brown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to investigate the animal to hints about his life, including its preserved intestine to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, went into a river and went out into the sea, where he sank on the back to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time Alberta was as warm as South fluorida today, and rivers and oceans probably widespread much further than they are today.</seg>

<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just one day after having arrived in New York City, sitting in St. Louis born on the bed of an airbnb apartment that they rented and scroll by Facebook on their phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">You stumbled across a post from someone from the high school.</seg>

<seg id="2025">A user with the handle @ Theepharoah was constantly saved on its timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The Rapper from the area of St. Louis was doing the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., killed, live to tweets.</seg>

<seg id="2028">"" "" "" "this is wild," "" "I thought Ferrell." ""</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She put her cell phone to return later in the evening to Tweets on people on the Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of the police band and people, the flashy, and by a man who claimed to be the father's father, who carried a sign with the transcription: "Fergusons police have just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed at which a policeman stood before a group of demonstrators with a bellishing dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"" "in another video, she said, escaped another police and cried:" "" "I will kill you... animals all kill." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2035">"" "" "" "this is not the kind of murder that we have accustomed to us and which we can call." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2036">At this moment I felt shook.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">You booked a return flight and went home next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 23 p.m., she took her 6-year-old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?" in the cinemas from 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and protest, of love and loss, the strength and resistance, which consists of the point of view of man who live in the community and filled the streets to request answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">As Ferrell with her daughter, who took a flower pity and a matching crown to Ferguson, spoke the two a conversation that they had countless times before this morning "about the black experience and the black condition."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you remember, as I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "" "reminded them of what they said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2044">"" "" "" "we are going to Ferguson because the police have killed a 18 year old boy and that was not right." ""</seg>
<seg id="2045">I could not take them, "said Ferrell later.</seg>
<seg id="2046">"" "" "" "what is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past." ""</seg>
<seg id="2047">They have to know and see it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed, not only activism and organisation, but also know the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even though I have the luck to give her an experience in which they personally experience no eklatant racism, it is not different from the next black women's child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">"" "I have the feeling, I would prove her a bad service to keep them away." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson, was at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a campground when the activists had waited on the possible non-accusation of Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter joined together with a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared pockets before and halted them pass on demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new type of activism began to accept for Ferrell's shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has changed after 9 August," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri Saint Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, Ferrell met in an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-director of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said, she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted only to document, "what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "a question came Ferrell in the sense:" "" "do you want to document or tries to find a story that you can use?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often from whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and its resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">"" "as Folayan recently explained in an interview:" "" "we heard that people who were born in Ferguson, who have not raised their votes and we wanted to do it differently." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis as well, an artist from the area that is known for its activism around too.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His engagement led Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other natives followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Browns Ergoose.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"" "" "" "this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we talk" "", "Davis said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "this was the main thing for me how these people will be represented, because I will be represented." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to focus on Ferrells experience - to show that it is in the movement "not about a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Consequently, documents of "Whose Streets show documents from" Whose Streets? "surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells Life, as she loves and marries her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"" "" "" "I felt like naked," "" "said Ferrell and laughed when they saw the finished product for the first time." ""</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understood that this work and the humanization of black people must give a certain vulnerability." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells History repeated the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives-Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, which after the killings of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 have shaped the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"" "" "" "black, gay women in leadership positions have supported the movement altogether," "" "said Ferrell," "" "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2074">"" "black, gay women must carry the main load of everything." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "Folayan voted, to notice that" "" "the movement really kept from black women and many black women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">"" "however, it insists that" "" "this is not a affirmative type of action," "" "when Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film." ""</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who stirred this energy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="2078">"" "" "" "there is no coincidence, although it was at the front line because with a life on these crosses as a black, gay woman is so much at stake." ""</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy by the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">In the meantime the communication eras in Ferguson have recently disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is at the currency for 2 ½ years due to the blockade of a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">It describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area they call their home: "a mess."</seg>

<seg id="2094">While the advocates build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, of which also the rest of business profit, fear the opponents, that then the pedestrian precinct.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Added: the gallery is planned exactly on the property, based on the farm market hall, where the 13 director will market their products.</seg>

<seg id="2109">One can see how many shoppers can be empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a proper weekly market there, it is all the more important that at least the market hall will remain.</seg>
<seg id="2111">For after all, the goods offered there is fresh, is mostly offered directly from the producer and is purely inexpensive.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, shoppers will be reserved in a shopping center just from larger companies, because the dorms are often not portable for a retailer.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist manages portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which hang out almost imperceptible to the cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen tubers and hair styles, which were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the outings out of the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former secret service analysts spent a 35-year prison sentence after they publicly made as geheim collapsed diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks site.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming resembbon (A suitable similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united its expertise in technology, computer sciences and art, and Manning, a transine and pioneering dismised, whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has created by the algorithmic analysis of DNA, which could look out of Manning and look out of the 30 portraits, a sharp if something intellectual comment could not only be interpreted as the formability of DNA data - the many ways that can be interpreted as well as the indurative determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but already spoke openly for her puberty over the identification as a woman, was sentenced in 2013 due to 20 accusations, including six violations of the SpionageAct, Computer was and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her image was suppressed, so much that it was only a single photo - a granular, black-white befie, in which Manning is visibly sit on a driver's seat and carries a platinum permit - with which it was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the great success of their 2012-project 'stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In it, the artist portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts like cigarette stubble and chewing gum that extracts the DNA out of the waste to make a picture of how these people could look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from an newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press show of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea, and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and their imprisoned Muse were unequal to unequal spectacles, which interchangeable several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created one of Shoili Kanungo Illusioned Comic "Suppressed Images," which would a future foresee in which the President Chertas would be ruling and they were able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, creings release after seven brutal years would demand in a military lame in Kansas, was a welcome type of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep and Starkes since Donald Trump will lead a war against informers from the governance and against transgender-troops to find new, tweetable ways to fix the rigid motions which he should actually fix.</seg>

<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a exchange of Cs and GS, and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters (or Nustiotides after the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist) how amazing, at least in biological regard, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"" "" "" "what people will hopefully bring, is that our genome is not about who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, Spurious Memories, too. "" "</seg>

<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition which is kept in a separate room is a page from the above comic Novelle.</seg>

<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers mourn't the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Gesellschaft Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="2208">It has been called people from outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new race of Human Resources Start-ups is at the guard to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing of software, which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee commitment, it allows companies to address surveys, specific groups and demographic groups to offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases whistleblowers allow to handle C-suite executives and contact the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"they now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for your business, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools used by companies to measure employees engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Salvation said that they have a better insight into what your employees think and feel with Glint in the three years.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the Snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat-card of the company, which shows in a look at which units have most complaints and which leaders have low charge results - so that you can indulge why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that at the forefront of workplace culture must remain so that you won't be the next Uber which has been implicated in Skandale since a former employee has published a blog post, which describes an environment of harassings, in which those who have spoken, punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups like Glint, this desire is an overview of lucrative business opportunity.</seg>

<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, the company helps prevent bad behavior and recognize, saw a rising interest and activity beginning of this year in the midst of the Uber-Fall in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently signed up as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">As Glint, Convertible company leaves tailor-made "pulmonary," confidential responses in real time and watch the warmth-cards of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline with the employee who can make bad behavior.</seg>

<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the court of public opinion has recorded the regulators," "" "says Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company is found that its employees treated poorly or behaves unethical, it can experience precious consequences by consumers-boycott, workers-fluctuation and cages, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, Convercent has been used for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to achieve its corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Sooner if a employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to submit a phone number or e-mail for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel who said, there was no good chance to follow the complaints from employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Well, since the company employs a Convercent, can problems that have been hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unconscious practicality - faster identified and addressed.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"I can get closer to this holistic, 360 degree view in the experience with employment," said Vitrano that leads the risk management Group from Ruby Tuesday.</seg>

<seg id="2231">Company began to appoint ethics, values and employees engagement in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapses due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But it lasted until the "Social Media came to their right," that companies recognised that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"prior to using technology for the monitoring of ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint as well as Convertible offer your software as a service and strain the company with recurring fees for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that will find the consent of Venture Capital investors, which both have supported start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire ventures and Tola Capital, which was raised the entire capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitans secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture partner and brought up his entire finance to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising, given the connected nature of companies, culture and Venture Capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more than ever before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high salaries and interesting projects only inserts.</seg>
<seg id="2241">Staff want to have the feeling that you are accepted and valued and that you will give your time a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"when people are glad to be in a company that is worth their voices, and that the work you are doing is worthwhile to make this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience on LinkedIn that both Convertible and Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors reach Rendiets when their portfolio companies are well running. companies run well if employees are engaged and engaged in it.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third parties promise, commitment and commitment to employees, it is no wonder that you will find assistance.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee involvement according to the experts of work culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data are useless if the administrator of a company does not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, if a company asks staff for your feedback, it can have an expectation that change on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change does not come quickly enough, or not at all, this can breed disappointments and employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen companies who have left themselves too much on collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "for if you do not follow the staff to ask," "" "I really heard me?" ""</seg>

<seg id="2252">And who do not worry about why should I? "</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed who runs for monthly surveys now, was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, says Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees it was through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, capable of organising several teams within the company and add a communication training to tackle the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">In Ruby Tuesday, the company always receives new insights on the employees, and it hopes that in a long run, this leads to a better liaison of workers in a sector that is known for high revenues.</seg>

<seg id="2379">Of this amount the land overtake 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2380">The agreement on which the shuttle is to be ordered also in the future of the country, will be finally matched, explained Süver.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry about ourselves</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it can not be crazy, a new report comes about technological developments in the field of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, emerious professor for robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield und Mitfounder of FRR, we must begin to take its rise seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye colour of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make themselves fun, but the companies deliver any quantity of it, and we will see them much more frequently," said Mr. Shared on the release of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpubs have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicon that feels warm and with deliberately human reactions, which are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also adjust its robots according to his beliefs "and select everything from the eye colour of the robot over the form of nipples up to the type or colour of his fingers.</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it is still disturbing, as many robots have the" "" "personalities" "", "which would look like a stepford-woman progressive." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpups have developed to robots with a silicon skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they will find appealing as a sobriety.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is still the True Companion developed Roxxxy Gold sex robots with preprogrammed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of shternity and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible," is the website of True Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">This may be what you like, and they don't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day they also have their moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "it can be tired, be fixed on conversation or it can be" "" "in mood!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient female properties that goes on rape when you take a step on Frigid (is called here: resisting) Farrah is unquiet one at most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why do men then have no Roxxxy?" is it on the site.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not only a fetish or simply just another sex-player.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their formation and their increasing refinement point to something darker and deeper into our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course keep any sex robots and while the FRR noticed their increasing popularity, they remain preliminary on the edge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what passes through the edge-zones can be in relation to the spirit of time in which we live, very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange, or insulting to them the free market there is permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is still a certain trimmer that these highly developed sex robots come in a time when the rights of women are threatened around the world in which there is a president in the White House that has hated women to be sexually attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The deterrent aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') are not the graphical images, the proper body and the broadcasted eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a big leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with Pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want it to be human, that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, to the point, when it comes to their "personalities, the robots are not a real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot be part of their companion or simply move away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They do not have a placement or background story, nothing that suggests about independence or anything, which might interfere with the imagination of total subjugation.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Expressed in other words: they are fake slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the Redemption of 2017: maid</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney to the epitome of the healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a binder of the Trump era that the political attitudes that have polarized the U.S. voters, have also split families in small-format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Erntedankant there were in the USA newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all allegedly remember to make our filtering inflatable.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of Trumps, families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I chose this because my cousins, a linear dichterine who lives in Chicago and has long been occupied with the republicans in our family who visited this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House everyone knows that she knows, including the Republican relationship, with whom she fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and very peculiar on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">Around the dining table, this is certainly a good thing, but it falls me in a further context that this also brings considerable risks to itself.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the enhanced effect of his presidency has the strength to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "when we speak of" "" "normalization" "" "and Trump, we refer to the great possibility that our kittens will no longer be billed to us of one day." ""</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is however a haven-time scenario, in the Trump Republicans of the right wing, "normalizes," which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as a term of negativity.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself talking about an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's funny version of the backward version - the dog on the car, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax returns) - both in comparison to Trump in fact occur in a very mild criminal offense.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump is going, the next candidate of the Republican only be spiritually healthy to qualify as immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the Carousel in Central Park, the largest of the Carussells of New York Parkdepartment, and the best three dollars that one can spend in town if you don't need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous large, the fiberglass design on the central cylinder - all clowns are scarred and the animals are turning to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate-pering music imparted this in a remarkable way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many Klischees of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings are old, the skylines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Twenty-five years later, and I am still not quite different over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is in fact no Swiss Cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not - but a great roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park-Carousel is still a strange magic experience, since two years old, a 11-year-old and two women can go on it and have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have had the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one has asked after that.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced to assess my "experience" with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could pass my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my road it is the same, plus the option that score a 15% drinking - this to buy something over the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowing of what is actually a neutral exchange, but also exercise pressure on the server to put personality into a situation in which no need is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the Kaufhaus stand excruding, while I tired the experience made to rich my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistory moved to the hospital in prison</seg>
<seg id="2450">Pistorius has left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year he was transferred to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts in his wrists, which he suffered the prison-authorities according to a case in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Pistorius has been sentenced to a first skillary role because of murder in the prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed steenkamp in the early morning of Valentine 2013 by taking them several times by a door of the toiletaker in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius said that he kept his girlfriend for a closer intruder that hid in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their intention, this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius appeal, from which they say, they be too indulgent.</seg>
<seg id="2456">The National Criminal Tribunal said that they will rise in the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the objection could be heard this year.</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius is danger that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help create IBD (inflammatory intestinal diseases)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study suggests exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, the symptoms of patients may alleviate with anti-sensitive intestinal diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable state that affects in the US around 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom of 300,000, causes stomach-fights and mower, recurrent or bloodless diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While the affected is usually going to chisel meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washingtoner University showed that the essential amino acid tryptophan von proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The conductive researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immunotherapy patented in the intestine to ensure that harmful microbes, hide not into the body, not penetrate into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells which are able to dissolve inflammation, become balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far towards inflammation, it can result in a inflammatory intestinal disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments it was found that a kind of tolerance-promoting immunisation in mice occurs, which carry a particular bacterium in their initiate.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins to dissolve the appearance of cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a link between a bacterial - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice in their food had, the more they had of these immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one of tryptophan-rich nutrition intolerance, less inflammatory intestinal flux, if the same system also supports people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoctoral candidate in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganese studied a kind of immune cell that promotes the tolerance as it found that a group of study judgments have had such cells, but another group of the same tribe that was separately accommodated, which had not had.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal microbial of mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice of the mice have been DNA-sequencing and there were six bacterial species available in mice with immune cells, but without being missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice have been raised in a sterilen environment, so that they were a intestinal microbiome and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria acted to the immune system, the researchers led L. to grow in a fluid and overled small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on uneven immune cells that were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">As the active component of the fluid has been purified, it proved to be a side-product of the Tryptophan-Metabolism, which is known as Indol-3-Milk acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells rose by about 50 per cent, but if the tryptophanovaries were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>

<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuse of abuse of the Pope Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">The author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on abuse of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman of the reform movement "We are Church," declared by the former Regensburger Bishop and today Kardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and by the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year brother of emerious Papal Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church much when Müller and atzatzinger their deep regret to express their own omissions or their then false estimate of processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican paper" "" "Osservatore Romano" "", "however criticized that in the reporting of violence in the cathedral-cats with" two "" "" same measure "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="2895">"" "as regards the transitions in Regensburg doubt, no one that it is" "" "shameful and shameful actions" "", "conspicuous, but the" "" "degree medial manipulation," "", "the author in Lucetta Scaraffia, historians, and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee." ""</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit, the Catholic Church as a source of all evil, is already part of the everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal for normal," "" "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">Also Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in an interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk: "one would like to go out to the church and that's a found frescoes."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "in addition, she pointed out that in her youth" "" "beats a very normal pedagogical means" "", "in order to be finished with children as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They are unfair to apply today sets standards to previous decades because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with reports on abuse of abuse often also pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who signed with Ratzinger the memoband "My brother of Pope" (in 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," "" "says Hesemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he considers the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-sided report, which has presented by Bistum Regensburg with Enlightenment, lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"" "a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and early 1990s" "" "with high plore" "" "victims of attacks, 67 domains" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg: "in summary, so that by Domkapellmeister R. were used in many cases physical and mental violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotionality, the brigation for the students could also be fierce.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Nevertheless, unlike many other accusations, there were many victims the general humanity of R. estimated and therefore in many cases have even positive memories with it in many cases. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann, why the final report on abuse of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger took his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440 pages report on the "incidents of violence against protracers in the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives an contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "for a lifting many students" "" "humanity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">For the other he also appears as a cholker and perfectionist, that was able to handle the Efteren hand if a domain name was not a top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate as his biographer this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: once you take the effort and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to wonder why the name Georg Ratzinger appears at all therein.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just been dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly acquitted from any suspicion of the mid- or co-life with the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Also the non-violence in the pre-school occurred out of its effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You can suspend him at best, to find out of it too late or taken first announcements not seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the domain" "" "Domspher" "" "in which he worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents than -" "" "salvation" "", "" "" and "" "" better world "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="2918">"" "so also the wide majority of his pupils Georg Ratzinger also presents him as" warm "," "" "competent," "", "" "", "competent," "", "" "", "" "", "" "", "" "", "" "", "" "", "" "", "" "" and bonbons "" "," and "" "" were surrounded by children of children. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complained about its perfection and its high emotionality, which also led to Wutoutbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he knelt not only with chairs and cast the keyword on the ground, but also earnesty guys in the hair or ears, he himself gave himself back years ago, deeply regretated and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">For his honor of honor, however, that such education methods in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s were widely used, in parents like with teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born in 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also have experienced this in a secular school, one state Gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely the irreplacental sexual abuse and nonviolence at the pre-school, are the true dreadmonial.</seg>
<seg id="2926">You ask yourself whether it is not likely to do with his familiarity and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just fallen upon him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">In the Bavarian Pope there are many who have never understood it, still freezeg.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media this report was reported much about the issue of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger also put in the final report any injury or co-operation with regard to sexual abuse at the load?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clear no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual claims asserted to become familiar to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I have never dreamed to speak with my father or my mother," "" "said a subject deputy for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">"" "" "" "the true issue in the education of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most of the victims are silent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they don't even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral leaders, who would have been a colleague of the offenders.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do Domspatzen students evaluate role in terms of abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a respondent student formed it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I do not see any case in which he would have had timely performance (Georg Ratzinger) and could have stayed the respective perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... also for really absurd to accept that there is no more urgent or more clear or more likely to be opened than to their parents, internatsmanager, confidence, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus the report comes to the very clear outcome:" "" "that the students involved in advance and / or their environment could not be confirmed in the framework of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">What sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free from each fellow of compassion.</seg>
<seg id="2943">He can also not be thrown at him, not prevented or brought him to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to bring its good name to these severe crimes, as unfortunately it happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media was much of" "" "Nonstop" "" "at the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is presented in the report." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in the coverage was mixed and troubled to a huge melange of sexual abuse and nonviolence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">Yet exactly this is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Namely, there is clean separated: between the pre-school and the Gymnasium of Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and nonviolence, as well, we say once, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Moreover, the report dealt with the report from the period since 1945, thus also for four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral leaders of the cathedral-cats.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole gruesy test pedagogy, the cases in which lad were scrapped by sadistical teachers, and attacked them, all in the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where truly skillous states have to prevails.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys first to face when they were already on the cathedral-site school.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "on what was the most witnesses emphasise, the theme" "" "Vorschule" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was just happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise of paradise."</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different in the New Testament school?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there have been discipline, but there was no savious violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that "many victims estimates the general humanity of R., and therefore in many cases even positive memories with it."</seg>
<seg id="2959">Thus remains at most still the accusation to be taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and was responsible for the proceedings at a school, where he didn't want to hear and responsible (such a witness) was not able to hear, and then again for 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Loss Georg Ratzinger consistently the ears consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the New Apostolic Church, which has even reproduced the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in it he points out that in the pre-school continues to practice the auditor." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Even in view of the danger of negative media public opinion, he recommended urgent entries.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was of course at a time when legal clarity existed, as auditor also banned in Bavaria too.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that occurred they made themselves in a legal gray area, just like everyone of us know well.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Since it was difficult to estimate for him, where the affected might be exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permitted border had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can not say it, he always had away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is just not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the auditor of schools in Bavaria was officially completed in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis claimed to be unfair, unless the current pedagogical standards apply to the then time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we are talking about "Fallstrick of the Anachronism," thus the danger, past the present moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">And the intercystine has already been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this of course does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abstained at all times and also not for what was broken in the pre-school to resilience and violence to innocent infancy, which goes beyond that time far beyond that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all completely awful and I am glad that it is finally working.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means for disciplining and brigation, so earnesty and in hair and ears were widely used in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">As a physical existence then it has been banned, he has also strictly kept strictly to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "which image of his rainy season has Georg Ratzinger, because in the talks with you for the book" "" "My brother of Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Came the subject auditioned in this case also to language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, told from his perspective, since then the Domspatzen also played a secondary role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I don't know at all that he led a strict regime there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must once be said, without this perfectionist discipline, without this perfectionist discipline, it would probably hardly have been possible to form an institution of world transplits, true cultural heritage of Europe and his musical tradition, which went straight to the USA twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and bondage alone, there is no big singer at all times and stand before every success, just in what field, still discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people have you seen as Georg Ratzinger on the talks about their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through working on the book and beyond, I met Georg Ratzinger really well and again and again as wonderful, humorous, very faithful and heartfelt people, one can't imagine that he could not only do a fly-to-man.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get along with how many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after its empowerment, regularly contact him to read it - he is almost blind - and to treat it as a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who do not forgive him today that he was strictly speaking to them are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the domain-cats are grateful to him today that he enriched her life and brought to them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovely respect person to whom they still have a look and to worship them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again clearly: all that one cast to him are educational methods that were at the time on the order of the day.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad we have overcome this time ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man, just because it is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make medial sinking.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intention that stands behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report that was just published, relieved him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the attack was to be a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits, and without the outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany no one would know the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
