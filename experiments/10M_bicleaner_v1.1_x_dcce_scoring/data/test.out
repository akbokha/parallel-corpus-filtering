Jennifer Ani@@ ston : I am always put in drawers
Jennifer Ani@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
this made the Hollywood star in an interview now un@@ ambiguous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am always put in drawers or glu@@ ed from the outside label that have usually little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself do not have the desire to be always perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; frank@@ ly , these things are rather snow@@ ed to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jennifer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh it as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as described in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opol@@ itan . &quot;
at the best , the act@@ ress spends her time at home , a TV with lo@@ cker@@ em Dut@@ y and Mexican food , is it in the magazine .
for the white anger they bring the question of the children &apos;s desire : &quot; we must not be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; as the Hollywood star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in her new film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mother &apos;s Day - Love Is not a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ani@@ ston &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is an ever @-@ born mother of two sons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the film runs with us as of 25 August .
Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the Sport@@ s@@ pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf courses in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was searched with some colleagues a bit of variety with a horseback ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Sport@@ s@@ pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses rec@@ alled her celebrations , they hun@@ ted in quick Gal@@ lo@@ p home to the feeding .
a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and with this the horse @-@ arri@@ vals ended up again and again .
on Saturday Germany was the best gol@@ fers of all times - 101 tournament races - again close to horses .
he left with his family about the complex of AL@@ RV to take on a horse he doesn &apos;t want to look for photo purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen , and therefore with CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite impressive .
the German sports@@ men over@@ hau@@ l the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small gala the Gol@@ dene pyramid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; awards , it does not lack the symp@@ athetic sports@@ men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreu@@ z , sil@@ ber@@ nes Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already paved him .
long is the 18th @-@ winner of the Sport@@ s@@ pyramid .
in Aachen , he met the first prize of Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for it is not only awarded for sporting achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger encourages the offspring .
and so he also gave the prize money from 25,000 euros .
with 15 other excellent sports@@ men , the dual US mast was taken on Saturday to the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports . &quot;
among the excellent include the athle@@ tics Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the ro@@ man Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ru@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the Spring@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the Spring@@ rider Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the Hand@@ b@@ aller Erhard .
many of these sports were brought on Saturday to Aachen .
after the official part , the illustr@@ ative society went to the Spring@@ stadi@@ on where the Lav@@ azza Prize ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ ics and Tru@@ mp@@ s Policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and prevent the T@@ TP trade deal - they want both Clinton and Tru@@ mp .
however , the two US presidential ri@@ ers are on the control and energy policy as well as in a fundamental demand .
differences in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a basic , rather philosophical difference .
the report on the role of the state .
Tru@@ mp intends to keep in doubt rather small and war@@ ns before how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wants to raise the economy to death and regulate death , he says .
he himself on the other hand would be quite different , claiming tru@@ mp .
he will massi@@ vely withdraw regulations , and he makes for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates strong - for private people and for companies .
Clinton on the other hand says : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , he has made disadvantage of dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money for it .
that is why the taxes for the rich , says it .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure .
in which one must be invested , Tru@@ mp and Clinton say almost elo@@ qu@@ ently .
the democratic candidate at all announces the greatest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ ing@@ y wing of the Re@@ public@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , on Tru@@ mp , there could be no party discussions yet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
significant are the differences in energy and climate policy .
Tru@@ mp wants to build coal power plants and rebuild the coal funding in the USA .
oil production should also be possible in far @-@ protected areas , the Paris climate agreement wants to cancel it .
Clinton on the other hand wants to extend and calls for renewable energies with its investment program : &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ o@@ tional trade deal , both do not want to sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time both the US want to isol@@ ate the US not from international trade , but simply protect American jobs better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the situation should then be paid even better , calls for example Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7,@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger wage .
she wants to increase it on 15 dollars per hour .
what Tru@@ mp wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be down , then he says he should not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand is tru@@ mp who wants to reduce the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his critics keep it before , that the budget deficit would only be even greater .
on the other hand , Clinton is at least demand the rich that they pay more taxes and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution .
escape : &quot; every fle@@ dged woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who are alone , almost to everyday life .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen there are four women .
each has a baby at the most one year old .
one has laid her little son in his arm .
he kn@@ itted with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother moved to the table @-@ top .
until she noticed that she is observed .
you sm@@ iles short and kiss@@ ed the little ones .
the scene works normal .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is a business manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor for social assistance services in Bavaria , and among other things deals with the subject of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are whis@@ per@@ ed .
they live in Munich in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for all women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made the establishment together with Pro Sagrada Familia and Mün@@ chner Women &apos;s Aid .
long ago , it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men there are no - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard on the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here , has done on their flight experience with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee for wars because they will be prosec@@ uted politically because they will dro@@ w torture or death , or because their families send them as hop@@ eless@@ ness to Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in women , other reasons for escape : &quot; many ste@@ al themselves secre@@ tly , because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
in their home country they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , Hon@@ mor@@ ed , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this is driving them away .
on the run it goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that tu@@ gs for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not uncommon , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe that the end as soon as they anchor in Germany , ir@@ re , told us .
here too , women in refugee income would often be considered inferior and hard@@ est if abuse .
this leads to approximately 90 percent of women living in the Munich area , trau@@ mati@@ zed , she appreci@@ ates her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so familiar that they had nothing to say .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t trust to talk openly about the experience , because the shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often do not help us , need more accommodations only for them , calls us .
the seven District governments in Bavaria is responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question , whether it is of a similar project like in Munich in its jurisdiction , answer some with no .
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there are so something in accommodations of governments not .
also in Schw@@ aben alone women are not separated alone , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Fran@@ ks , there are some community @-@ related stories or their own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separately by men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study that was published for the committee said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lacking privacy , or will accommodate men and women , it may come to an ongoing - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all the wash@@ rooms should be separated and accessible for women easily , stands in the study .
how much the women feel of this protective need , one can stand at the And@@ rang , which there is to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it has been tr@@ apped that there is us , we have a long queue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily set up a second house .
general strike : demands for new working practices
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; grant of the assistance of the assistance , their trade union have called to be a new working @-@ position in their disputes with regard to a new contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Junior Do@@ ctors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has requested its entire Council , starting in early September more labour @-@ making measures .
the J@@ DC said that there had been Minister of Ministers to address the concerns regarding the contract .
assistance and medi@@ cam@@ ents have voted in July on the ref@@ usal of a contract which has been agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who have voted among the elections .
in a letter to the members , who was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the President of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court , that the government would be &quot; insi@@ sted calm &quot; to problems , which led to that the contract was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC Executive Board voted completely to reject the proposed new contract completely and calls for official negotiations to all em@@ itters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC committee today made a formal request to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to raise a running program for escal@@ ating work measures , beginning of September .
the disputes arising that Assi@@ stance this year were sixteen @-@ strikes , the first total accidents in the history of the N@@ HS .
the director of the BM@@ A Assi@@ stance Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana joined the election of the agreed contract conditions that have been recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings , who were still standing ahead of the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assist@@ ants and medi@@ cam@@ ents , with that the treaty was beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the Health Minister Jerem@@ y Hunt is that the treaty was introduced to doctors in England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia and Turkey : an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alliance of Foreign Affairs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give the hands and preach an official end to the eight months of long @-@ term war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish counter@@ player in the gold @-@ pl@@ ated hall of St. Petersburg Palace in the reception , I cannot for@@ bid myself to the expression that Ankara wants to make this reconciliation most .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s sm@@ iles were ding@@ y and he pointed out hardly heat even for its backward circumstances .
Rec@@ ep Tayy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , however , spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times .
I could not count it anymore .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to its old level before the crisis , but can even better be improved .
the next day a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan would have heard so would never happen something worse .
to me his enthusiasm was rather the opposite to imply .
but one of Putin &apos;s radiant , sustainable cool@@ ers showed that the President of Russia had forgotten nothing .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first what he mentioned in his introductory remarks : the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border by Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s response to time was w@@ alled .
Putin informed and accused Ankara , Russia in his back .
the verb was even bigger , since it was committed by a alleged friend .
the Vet@@ ro@@ en rebuild again becomes difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
months long the state @-@ controlled media led a fierce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at once it seemed to be the Turks for all the guilt .
at the most serious issue , the accus@@ ations of leading officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benef@@ ited by the illegal oil trading in areas of Syria , which are controlled by the so @-@ called Islam@@ ism state .
he has denied this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse that he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara the benefits of a ceas@@ e@@ fire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan is primarily required to get all the friends he could get after last month with a f@@ eit@@ ed coup above his ministry .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have made Turkey tough - in particular the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number is reduced by nearly 90 % .
in Russia travel agents and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are taken back .
you are counting on a late seasonal ons@@ lau@@ ght in the Mediterranean .
this week , the national watch has predicted fruit and vegetables , as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports will be allowed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in V@@ demo@@ sti form@@ ulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry on the West as it looks to the tried of power as a weak answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this , the ongoing Gro@@ ll comes across the sn@@ ail of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ke to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian state of State won in Ankara with certainty a bonus that he asked for the coup d support for the elected state institutions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is well @-@ known for Moscow is a matter of course , that itself has changed a deeper fear of reg@@ iment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the summit meeting in this splendid palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey , one , as it was an an@@ alysts once described , &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ties &quot; : two countries which ch@@ ased out from the West and were poorly treated .
nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still major differences between the two still .
the biggest difference is Syria where Moscow recently gave the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support contradi@@ ct@@ ory sides .
it could be indic@@ ative that after nearly three hours of initial discussions on the press conference , they said that they would not even have understood the subject .
the president of Turkey was clearly evident on a question about their differences , while Putin decided to stress this .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and considering the potential for a complete disper@@ sion , as NATO member Turkey ab@@ om@@ it the Russian martial arts - it is certainly better that the two heads of state should talk at least one another .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland &apos;s not available anymore
the R@@ BS brand is to be reduced to a back@@ office role according to the member state of the bank .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
R@@ oss Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland associated with the R@@ BS brand with the global ambitions of the bank .
the Bank has under@@ gone up since eight years ago , when she had almost collap@@ sed and saved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at this time , bran@@ str@@ ate@@ gen is used &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to protect other end consumer finances . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it supported the international sport with millions pounds of sponsor@@ ing , from the six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to the Wimbledon winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now it has decided to put more national brands into the focus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will be available only for customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B testimonials are changing , the de@@ centr@@ alised headquarters and the stock exchange to Nat@@ west .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for private customer business , which will get more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Drum@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a guided tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B is becoming our Invest@@ ors &apos; brand as well as the brand , where our employees will be busy , as we are now more to become a bank of brands . &quot;
when the Bank has become a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am saying that we do not pursue a global goal but to pursue local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these marks will be completely different in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work among these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that there will be his six Nations Sponsor@@ ing no longer will lead and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in his sport sponsorship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to develop into the bank of the brands , as we focus on inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal in three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have brought these marks .
but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these marks again , so I think that the time has come .

the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ ten British prize at New@@ market on Friday .
he sat on Pre@@ al@@ ction which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone .
the 45 @-@ year Italians is the sixth yo@@ ckey , which reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Ri@@ chards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester pigment , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son .
the three im@@ ali@@ ge winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won before G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar said , &quot; It is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional , because my family is here too
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very happy that there is happen at New@@ market , because I &apos;m going to be back here 30 years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it is a ban@@ aler Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the Ju@@ bel , when he desc@@ ends the victory on Pre@@ al@@ ction
two Jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacles of obstacles - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a real @-@ breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ go@@ t , the ninth Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 care@@ ers
Frank@@ ie is one of the best yod@@ els of modernity and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone only a few of them have achieved .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ le@@ ct that differs from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambass@@ ador for racing , his enthusiasm and char@@ isma fans have been enth@@ r@@ alled for years for this sport .
I said Frank@@ ie in front of a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already fet@@ ched 6,000 prizes if he would not only be a weekend and grand@@ tur@@ ni@@ ho@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has suffered from the winners in the UK for nearly 30 years , which is great .
he has a vibrant personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flag@@ ship of the British flat for two decades .
it was annoying .
a whole series of grand@@ tur@@ ni@@ ers gain , including its famous &quot; glorious Seven &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash , and received a drug crash .
three years ago he had difficulty returned , when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to de@@ fy its branches and to return to its shape .
and he is not yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue with competitions until his least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of life .
Russia Putin feudal staff , Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
the Russian president Vladimir Putin did not release his staff , Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years part of the closest trust of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed as a special officer for environmental and transportation .
in an opinion of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it is that Putin has arranged the dis@@ mis@@ sal of Ivan@@ ov by its duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was dep@@ uty since 2012 Ivan@@ ov &apos;s dep@@ u@@ ties , was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
in 1972 he was born in the Est@@ onian capital , he made his conclusion at the renowned Moscow Department for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in Tokyo &apos;s embassy in Tokyo .
on the Kre@@ m@@ lin &apos;s website ( in Russian ) it was later called a director and leader of the government personnel .
he said to Putin about his appointment , &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as heads of state and controls for the implementation of your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday with that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and have recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the ridic@@ ulous faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest trusted Vladimir Putin &apos;s and works as he is for the Soviet intelligence , the K@@ GB .
as a leader , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on TV , both men claimed that the staff will withdraw his own request .
but despite the sm@@ iles for the cameras , here are only few of them convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
here is the consequence of a kind of power @-@ fighting ?
this is currently no one .
but the official statement - that a man who was once more pri@@ zed as a potential president , who would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - came to great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks about Putin , who are cited on the website of Kre@@ m@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov said it is true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - compl@@ aining about four years .
as it turns out , I have been Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov accepted the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Minister of Defence and Defence Minister .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin &apos;s former member of the State Security Service ( K@@ GB ) .
in the late 1990s , as Putin Chairman of the Federal Security Treaty ( FS@@ B ) was appointed to the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his dep@@ uty .
when he came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted .
once it was believed that Ivan@@ ov could be President of Russia in the second term president of Russia as a third presidential coup against the Constitution .
but this post was taken from another , close ally , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became prime minister before he became president three and a half years later .

Queens@@ eta Cros@@ sing : bridge now connected with fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion @-@ expensive project should be completed by May 2017
engineers have joined the northern deck of the Queens@@ ek Cros@@ sing with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected with fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four uses of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deck@@ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cover &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which approach each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the brid@@ ging of fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30.000 ton .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 tons @-@ silk .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion @-@ expensive project should be completed by May 2017 .
economic Minister K@@ eit@@ h Brown took a visit to the site today and was one of the first to go from the land to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queens@@ d Cros@@ sing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of an engineering experience of a truly ep@@ ic extent in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel which were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the switch between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit .
overall , almost 79 % of the total bridge can be found at their place and the last section of Dec@@ ks today in Ros@@ y@@ th is a sc@@ ong@@ ate for the deck , which means the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place .
Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Constru@@ ctors said : &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone in each bridge project .
this fantastic project represents the trend @-@ oriented high@@ - and deep construction .
after installing the last road@@ section and its connection with the Nord@@ tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to fill the still existing gap in the north or country side .
this was achieved by dra@@ gging the northern exposure bridge 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive , since the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 meters long , ca . 6,000 tons weighs up and at an incl@@ ine of approximately 3 % had to be pulled upwards .
delicate , because the toler@@ ances who works on which the team works , tiny - on each side , they only ro@@ b a few millimeters .
fortunately everything went very well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; salvation in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown by her fishing boat from fro@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI lif@@ ebo@@ at station hit the Friday at 13 : 20 B@@ ST alarm after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulties swim in safety while their boat moved on their own strength .
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around itself and set us the worst before , &quot; said the head of the lif@@ ebo@@ at of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones .
&quot; thank@@ fully , the strong winds that leaves the boat from their reach until we left water , &quot; he added .
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found at a bo@@ e without lif@@ ebo@@ at without life@@ jacket .
all of them came aboard the coast and were brought back to the lif@@ ebo@@ at station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were cast into the water will be lucky , and still be alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boot engine was available via a not@@ ch , but this sol@@ dered itself at the k@@ ic@@ t of the Bo@@ ots from the person who controlled the boat .
someone today knew about these men today .

who builds Braunschweig apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investors should be much stronger in the future in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to bad news , that Braunschweig is going to lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acting concept &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the next R@@ ats@@ session . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the argument is programmed .
first and foremost , it is about question : who is supposed to build the cheap apartments ?
one regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD &apos;s Leader of Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas in future must show 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the cheap apartments can also be found in the stock market .
but the big issues in the town hall is , however , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you want to build with investors to build on private areas ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build investors on such areas at least 10 per cent , but as 20 per cent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new urban housing funding programme that will cost millions of cost and must be financed for incentives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the groups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U would like to make investors as few rules as possible .
the left does not want any hard@@ ship for investors .
regardless of whose , so Brat@@ mann , bah@@ t a shar@@ pen@@ ing of the situation in the housing market .
the action concept is implemented , will ensure additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the expertise .
yet the program is not yet fully : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how does one balances out the loss of more than 1300 favorable apartments that will run for the next few years ?
there will be 500 apartments alone by 2020 .
to prevent this , so the plan@@ atory consultation in Nicole Palm , should now be bu@@ sted by the city .
furthermore , it would have to be thought to return apartments back to the price .
this is possible in the west town .
one fell s@@ woo@@ p to solve the problem .
because in the west town there are dates for the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments you could get back to the price @-@ binding for cheap apartments .
only : this does not want the owners , the housing companies do not .
for the number of social housing in the west city again increases dras@@ tically , you can get away from the goal of so @-@ called thorou@@ gh@@ ness .
there is no need to be a concentration of social weak in only a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens assume that there will be even movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a wide majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is concentrated on more construction sites for single family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise can not yet be found .
Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to watch how the world changes .
that teenage boys and child to play no longer go outside , but rather prefer to spend their free time with it , on screens to rigid , has been lam@@ inated in the last decade of many .
at Po@@ k@@ em@@ on Go , it is about getting people from the sofa and become more active .
the time on the screen was initially based on TV , then on video games and last on smartphones .
therefore it is great to see that technology and activities do not exclude each other in the open air .
I naturally refer to the Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters , who were first created for the video games in the 1990s ( later created from it a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) .
how many phenomena of Pop@@ civil@@ isation sunk in the interest before the release of the game in the US , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July .
the launch in other countries has been postponed by massive demand that over@@ loaded the server .
within a few days Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go more users had as Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players with their smartphones go outside and look for Po@@ k@@ é@@ m@@ ons that are tr@@ acked with a GPS once they were found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a scre@@ enshot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the W@@ ahn and sp@@ rang up for the search of the sofa .
in the United States the game led to a considerable increase in steps that puts the &quot; average &quot; person every day .
Car@@ di@@ o@@ gram , an app for Apple Watch , distributed 3@@ 5.000 users recently shared the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of trac@@ eable folks who exercise every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays with Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go - it merely sees raw data to increase performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns to health that people want to bring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to come from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be active every day , because many public messages are boring to be boring and coming from people who look forward . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the meaning of sport can not be evaluated .
who regularly drives sport , reduces its chances to prevent cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here .
but the wonderful thing at Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors , making them fun .
thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun .
some people close to the hunt even new friend@@ ships .
as always there is also m@@ aturing game cor@@ rupted , who always have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what is it ?
it has a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit earlier we were able to trace our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sport as it does this game .
the new will lose its charm and use it with time .
due to Po@@ k@@ em@@ on &apos;s success , however , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and help with many people on hunting , active , f@@ itter and healthier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the print .
forget the h@@ ype .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all this im@@ mu@@ n .
dynamic on the spring@@ horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the floor .
on gan@@ zer line brilliant .
and now finally Olympics .
the 19 year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday for multi@@ tap and enlarged the gap between yourself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the head@@ lights of the Olympic Games .
her overall result of 6@@ 2.@@ 198 was clearly before the Silver medal and &apos; Final Five &quot; -@@ Mann@@ er@@ ad@@ in A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Bronze medal of Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the Americans of Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ mo@@ cks on the pig @-@ beam of women in the art of art during the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American , who wins a multi @-@ fighter title , and altogether the fifth , while she demonstrates its reputation , the best of their generation or even at all .
it collap@@ sed in tears than its end result was shown and her long journey was found at this moment .
this success puts them in the same League as unique athletes , such as Michael P@@ helps who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years their sports species - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - including so amazing exercises , that the olymp@@ ic lady from 1984 Mary Lo@@ u b@@ ail@@ on from her said that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast that I have ever seen . &quot;
it was expecting her last test in Brazil , a competition which was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of excessive expectations .
not with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas return , would be considered as disappointment .
the Americans of Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace themselves after they won gold and silver in the single majority of women in the art of art during the Olympic Summer 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday ,
Bil@@ es took the first medal at the Tuesday while on the f@@ arewell party who retired from the retirement team of Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a fe@@ asts .
although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted , during their long journey to the top , never the future is planned , this is not really true .
part of their ground exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the road outside the Olympi@@ ad arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and has been adopted by Train@@ ers A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school@@ ing into the gymn@@ asium , became a force in the bo@@ or@@ man .
since the summer of 2013 , it has lost no more competitive competition since the summer of 2013 , a strainer which will last as long as Bil@@ es wishes .
even when Must@@ af@@ ina led through two swi@@ vel , dec@@ eas@@ ed the picture .
Schwe@@ be@@ bal@@ es and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ nen - in which Bil@@ es keep the World Cup - lau@@ ded .
she returned again with 15.@@ 4@@ 33 on the pig @-@ beams again - and put one on the ground with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 .
Ra@@ is@@ man revers@@ ed her sof@@ tly as her En@@ der@@ g@@ nis - a pure form@@ ality - and tears flow on Bil@@ es glos@@ sy red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision they once described in their collection @-@ book , to reality .
the achievement of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a re@@ venge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the Bronze Medal at a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time had the 22 year old team capit@@ ulate that is called by Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Grand@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after their floor exercise , she threw to the audience of Kus@@ sh@@ es , overwhelmed by a com@@ eback , which sometimes doub@@ ted .
what Bil@@ es affects , so that the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has got a whole new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims in series production by music shot in the car
according to police reports , which were published on Thursday were shot two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl who have been converted into one of the deadly attacks for a decade in the first series of production of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and heard music .
Angela Merkel Liner , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked in an entrance , the authorities said .
the perpetr@@ ator moistur@@ izes eight shots from a hand @-@ fire @-@ weapon , while he stood on the passenger &apos;s side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , can be read in the report .
the police told that the triple murder did not seem to be the result of a pre@@ dat@@ ory everything , since the att@@ acker does not participate the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who found themselves in possession of one of the adult victims .
the Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ he@@ cher by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shal@@ e erei investig@@ ator the investig@@ ator to become a closer look at that it is connected to four previous attacks .
in total , predominantly in H@@ isp@@ anic dwell@@ ings were killed in nine months in nine attacks , and two more in@@ ju@@ red .
&quot; it is happening in a residential neighborhood in front of a house , &quot; shared Howard of the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of CB@@ S , beginning of the month .
it is believed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that attacks are linked to the same mur@@ derer .
Ellis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized on account of her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot .
a witness to the police with that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the s@@ late truck which led to an empty Pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial port .
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ gs and secured a bul@@ let from the seat as well as ball@@ ots from the engine space .
mother of a 6 @-@ year old with micro@@ cep@@ halia : &quot; it becomes better &quot;
as most 6 @-@ year @-@ old loves Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to the singing , toys and of course his mother .
but as the least of his retirement has Ed@@ mund micro@@ cep@@ halia , the result of a genetic disorder that didn &apos;t know his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during their pregnancy .
when he came home the first time was my first thought , I didn &apos;t manage that .
I didn &apos;t manage this .
I did not let me go .
what is not right -- of course one has moved on it , &quot; she said .
your husband Vincent and you have been told that Ed@@ mund sie can never recognize them under circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they pret@@ end to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer to it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a wal@@ ker .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor cr@@ ush up to his third life , and he can still not speak .
but he has slowly making progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also likes to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the string that Ed@@ mund for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please tell me something &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bring him string language , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to CB@@ S News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not a typical character language -- says it . Ed@@ mund has invented a few characters alone .
micro@@ cep@@ halia has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as mas@@ ons or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of those with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus advertis@@ ers .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to remember the emotional price of an irregular future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t know yet .
I have not asked for a long time after the progn@@ osis because I do not expect that anyone can truly tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eless advice for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth damage caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it is better .
you know that it will become better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
violent ra@@ inf@@ alls , floo@@ ding gives rise to b@@ ail@@ ments in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Mississippi
fierce ra@@ inf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floods in Lou@@ isi@@ ana explo@@ des the governor to rel@@ ies on Friday the emergency room . it is calculated all the Saturday with more ra@@ inf@@ all .
numerous rivers in the southeast Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the For@@ pp@@ is floo@@ ded their banks and dro@@ ple@@ aded with large @-@ scale floods after extreme ra@@ inf@@ all , reported the National Weather Service .
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John Bel Ed@@ wards shared that the state officials are standing in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the way to the communities concerned .
Mike Ste@@ els , a spokes@@ person for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ edness of the governor , shared that the inquiries for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags multiplied .
Ste@@ els said that alone the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a ten thousand sand@@ bags would have requested .
a floo@@ d@@ war@@ n@@ system is used across wide parts in the south Lou@@ isi@@ ana until Saturday .
the we@@ ather@@ service led ver@@ able that in this field additional 3 to 5 inches may fall to rain .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ amas was used on Friday a Fl@@ ut@@ breakfast system , while the Mobile continues to rain in the field of Mobile .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will be able to reach all probability over the weekend .
the Met@@ ere@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could floo@@ ded many houses in the location near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a current floo@@ ding of the flood in Ascension Par@@ ish represents a danger , since these are slowly flowing across the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river tick@@ le , south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , finished Friday at 09.@@ 00 on Friday at 09.@@ 00 .

L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his wife were found among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally located more than 400 feet from his house , overnight heavily climb .
he told him a further embro@@ ider@@ y that dw@@ ells near , warned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are awakened and the water flow and p@@ umped into , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife said Hans@@ ford that she lived in the 48 years , in which she lived there , never had such a strongh@@ old of the river .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have had all the disabilities , and he would be one , who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that N@@ oth@@ el@@ fer had saved all three in a big military truck and brought them to the next fire@@ guard in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated by Friday .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding had spread out quickly since there were still heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and that the authorities would consider evacu@@ ation instructions .
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann announced an observer near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the soil has been considerably soci@@ alized since Wednesday .
the authorities gave that serious ra@@ inf@@ alls and street floo@@ ding the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a Par@@ ish and dis@@ armament into five school districts .
the CB@@ S subsidiary for WW@@ L reported that a subsi@@ dy in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a 200 in@@ und@@ ated houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches which were now both in@@ und@@ ated .
the Vor@@ steh@@ er of the community Rob@@ by Mill@@ er said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets that were pur@@ ged from the flood .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond have been set up emergency accommodations to host the evacu@@ ation .
&quot; once the water starts to go back , they will be back to their homes , &quot; he said .
in the city of Ham@@ mond of the Municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a , almost two d@@ wind@@ y roads were closed due to the flood @-@ waters and sand@@ bags for residents for co @-@ operation who hope to hold the water from their houses and shops .
&quot; the last great floo@@ ding that we had , was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration .
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Shanghai , the Emer@@ gency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it continues on the Gulf Coast .
according to his information , a handful of houses will be reported on Thursday than sw@@ amped , but on Friday we have not been reported .
K@@ eit@@ h Town@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places where I never saw it before , &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the police shares that the 6 year old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time a 6 @-@ year child was shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boys identified him for CB@@ S Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents gave that Brown has suffered several weak injuries , including in the lungs , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was with his transportation to hospital in consciousness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done much , his small body was crossed by balls &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; divided his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z the sender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can simply not believe this .
the condition of the boy was regarded as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the family &apos;s family shared the transmitter with that he is expected to recover again .
he should have started the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in Ger@@ mant@@ own .
also three men were shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are according to CB@@ S Philadelphia in stable condition .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , which is located in a critical state , reported the sender .
the other two victims were not found in the car and the police are determined whether among one of the final men of the perpetrators could be found .
investig@@ ators shared CB@@ S Philadelphia with that it seems to have come to a cross fire between multiple guns .
Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen for Stur@@ m@@ gewe@@ er , which were re@@ trac@@ ed to various ra@@ ids , over@@ se@@ wn the Tat@@ ort .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seems that it was clearly tra@@ ded to a continuous battle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the road , on both sides of the walk , H@@ ül@@ sen was found .
so there are several armed fighters to have been involved here , who were very actively involved , &quot; distributed police cor@@ ne@@ al Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di police in Philadelphia of the transmitter .
several houses and vehicles were taken in the area .
there was no for@@ tifications and the police are currently checking reports according to the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year girl got hit by a cross @-@ sleeps in the arm when she played in front of her house in the West Oak Lane .
they recovered and the police are still looking for a susp@@ icious one .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that &apos;s what I present to me under the women &apos;s Olympic team and that is more than one reason .
first of all , I have been in the summer olymp@@ ic since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three gymn@@ as@@ tics , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , inspired for many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jewish ist and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the Catho@@ lics , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the United States .
it has paved the black and h@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one was one among the female gymn@@ ast .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this is showing strength .
at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising olymp@@ ic lady and America .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple World Championship in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez to be as they were unexpected , but master@@ ful G@@ ym@@ as@@ tical routines supplied .
on Thursday Simone the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American , who won an individual maj@@ esty event for women gold .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won Silver .
we experience the tip of this sport , but so are the classes around the country not off .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie smote all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to create it into the Olympic Team .
they are the &quot; L@@ earned Five &quot; because the next Olympics are only four tur@@ ers in the team . moreover , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer .
but the reality looks like that Tur@@ nen ein expensive sport is and Tur@@ ner primarily associated with private turn@@ around which are maintained by parents who costs for training , furnishing , travel - and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . the list can be continued as desired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of these turn@@ around are in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in these verses , the tur@@ ers will receive their entire training and that is for the families a te@@ ures and long @-@ term commitment .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , Train@@ ers of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , Train@@ ers of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both trained their athletes , since they started with the tower .
we have to be inspired to the municipalities au@@ n countless , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , offering a performance and easier accessible gym .
I was founded my turn@@ son of 20 years .
we have trained free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for more than 15@@ ,000 urban young people ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) and trained national and international vi@@ ctors .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality tur@@ s that deserve the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sport .
tower develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination gives life @-@ long advantages for health as well as for educational and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the tur@@ s and that is great .
it is so important to take part in sports , especially for girls .
it is an exciting time .
thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this genuine presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the Olympic team . thank you , F@@ ass her so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistance would like to organize other strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts suggestion
the Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes through adoption of a re@@ formed contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.000 assist@@ ants who voted on a choice , rejected him .
in July , Hunt plans un@@ v@@ elled to introduce the contract , and said that the N@@ HS would become detri@@ mental in a &apos; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land , and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful .
the first assistance of assistance should receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekend work to improve the care of un@@ changing times .
DR Ellen Mc@@ Court , the president of the BM@@ A Committee for Assi@@ stance elected last night in a communication with : &quot; Assi@@ stance elected to the proposed treaty still serious concerns , in particular that there will be the current staff crisis and admini@@ ster it to treat all physicians . &quot;
with only eight weeks , still remain until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out .
efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to solve the disputes by talks with the government to take part in the government and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
it happened during a promise that Jerem@@ y Hunt was made only last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hunt must now act , raise the insurrection and address the concerns of the assistance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should he not do this , we have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further working practices .
the last strike at the end of April saw a rise of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialized doctors were included in order to provide doctors on the strike chain .
the Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes through an acceptance of the re@@ formed contract with the leaders of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A would like to pay a better vo@@ dka re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation for the 5@@ 4,000 assist@@ ants who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director of the N@@ HS employee , called for assistance to end the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labour forces reach nothing but little , but is already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , nur@@ ses and their families just worry , need and interruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last two months we have talked to the compres@@ sor of assistance and with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries responded positively to the concerns regarding tut@@ el@@ age and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ ing .
employers hoped that the continued positive engagement with other important topics - such as discharge , flexibility in training , training , mutual recognition of the cur@@ riculum , training holidays and the gender Ministry of Health , respecting agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day medication , which can reduce the heart of heart
thousands of heart attack will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication , having been recommended by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the ger@@ inn@@ ate drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeti@@ tive heart attack for people with a cardi@@ ac disease .
the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , thus reducing the risk of stroke and another heart attack .
the regulatory authority Nice of the N@@ HS has been recommended for a period of four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the regulatory authority Nice of the N@@ HS has been recommended for a period of four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
approximately 14@@ ,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of it suffer a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attack and stro@@ kes are caused by an@@ tim@@ ents of fatty material in the arter@@ ies , the har@@ ass@@ y form .
when the si@@ ag collap@@ ses , it can cause a blood @-@ cl@@ ot@@ r@@ attle that reson@@ ates the blood flow through to the heart and thereby caused a heart attack .
when the blood c@@ inn@@ acle dis@@ sol@@ ves , it can flow through the blood stream and leaves the flow of blood to the brain which causes a stroke .
individuals who already had a heart attack , are subject to a higher risk to have another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is distributed under the commercial name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots un@@ probable .
the schedule of Nice , which today has been published today recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ le Long@@ son , director of the Nice Health Auth@@ entic@@ ation Centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary education , a quarter of all persons , who suffered a heart attack , a further heart attack , or stroke - often with dis@@ astrous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a new heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in is effective in reducing other her@@ edi@@ tary and stro@@ kes in people who already had a heart attack .
through a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are happy that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who benefit from it .
the information about the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the blood risk - is limited to a period of up to three years . the draft bill recommends not treatment that eman@@ ates over this period .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ite can blo@@ om in Muslim regions
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ for Rah@@ man was removed last year on dis@@ mis@@ sal of a government report because of corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ t has led that extensive electoral campaign was know@@ ingly ignored in Muslim communities such as a cr@@ ushing government report today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former president of Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es acc@@ esses the police , electoral monitoring and Rath@@ usi@@ ans to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over@@ sensitivity regarding eth@@ ic and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former minister of integration and communal government , which is now an Ant@@ ony @-@ escal@@ ator , said that the intim@@ id@@ ation of voters from religious motives were so bad that the police should be permitted to set off @-@ bands outside of electoral boards , to protect voters outside .
he recommends that voters should lead a ID with themselves in order to prove their identity in elections .
at present , a vot@@ er must just call its name and address .
the report proposes , not removable ink on the finger of a person when they give their election , to prevent that someone cho@@ oses twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
he asks that the press should have more access to common documents and decisions of not official comm@@ ons or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only for electoral campaign , but also the municipal government before the wider corruption and finance culture that goes with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets Leg@@ sk@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
last year , a special court decided that the acting Mayor Lut@@ for Rah@@ man ought to be corrupt to corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the court was that Rah@@ man would have per@@ sec@@ uted the religious feelings of his Muslim Community &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and that he would have brought his critics with se@@ gregation and Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man should have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the rel@@ ati@@ ous duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of a im@@ itation to choose one person as someone else .
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of fraud throughout the country .
he is particularly alar@@ ming about frau@@ dul@@ ent post@@ code - at the older members of the Muslim Community pressure on people who had made a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including filling out to prove the identity
in his report it says : &quot; proof was attached that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exer@@ ted , especially women and young people in order to choose according to the Will of El@@ ders , in particular communities with Pakistan or bank@@ rupt background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was concerns that ... state institutions such as such behaviour due to &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transi@@ tions regarding eth@@ ic and religion should not be ignored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban on the prohibition of political activists , edit , in order to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constitu@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , requires also tough@@ er audi@@ tions to prevent that the electoral directory is used to imp@@ mig@@ rate and social @-@ reli@@ ational purposes .
consider options to ask voters before choosing to ask your ID .
not removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has given her voice to prevent that someone cho@@ oses twice .
systematic review about the nationality of a person perform to make sure they are optional .
a three @-@ year limit on applications to an automatic letter .
ban that political activists complete letter elections and envel@@ opes of counter @-@ elections can be performed .
the police give the authority to set up back@@ ups for electoral stations .
a legislative change that facilitates an accus@@ ation due to intim@@ id@@ ation according to the Re@@ presentation of the People Act 1983 ( census Act 1983 ) .
photography offered in voting stations .
request that only English in the election stations must be used ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the staff will generally enforce that voters alone go to the election cabins .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &apos; amazing &apos; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets do not show any pen@@ al code .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vote has Lut@@ for Rah@@ man and his dep@@ uty for the corrupt and illegal practices as uns@@ killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been approved due to a number of reasons for sufficient - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings - guilty .
it also critici@@ zed the effective &quot; Ab@@ ha@@ k@@ om &quot; of the Rath@@ au@@ tions of the Rath@@ geber .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court part in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country bears a proud heritage as the mother of the parliaments , but the worrying and covered spread of election amoun@@ ted and denial of some authorities to thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Double @-@ predecessor in and other famous Doppel@@ gänger of Olympics in Rio
fans of the Olympi@@ ad 2016 in Rio are found this week on the French Rad@@ sport@@ - Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot except Rand and Band , which has proven to be an impressive double @-@ story in the Her@@ zo@@ gin of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year Olympics is by far not the only one in order to fight gold batt@@ led Ath@@ let , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not , if you can give the social media faith .
to honor the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are fli@@ ck@@ ering at the time on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a lists of Olympi@@ ad who have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Horn@@ y@@ makers .
the hunters and the wolf : team member of the U.S. team in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o
apart from K@@ ates doubled in the Rad@@ ren@@ n@@ bahn many people on the internet point out how a certain ar@@ cher of the Gem@@ ini @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o could be .
the team member of the U.S. team in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush on Twitter after pictures on which he looks similar to the wolf of Wall Street Star scary .
in fact , the ar@@ cher was given the mad@@ ness in the social media with and gave to the fact that he has already heard since his childhood , that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I myself do not see any great simil@@ arity , except the facial hair , &quot; divided Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a ben@@ ign guy , so I do that probably as compliments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be at the center : the uni@@ fying simil@@ arity between the British vast@@ ly Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ af@@ ina with its big , expres@@ sive eyes should be able to pass through double @-@ fold in for the Cub@@ an American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh for years compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
a course higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption Schauspiel@@ ers
another decent comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , which has similar heavy eyeb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medals in Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova has more than just the sun@@ shades of skin and bl@@ on@@ ate hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ Cor@@ d , while the American Nathan Adrian von fans was attacked , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial form and eyes
not the one : a Twitter user was very happy that others like the similarities also .
theory contained in the room : according to this user there is for the simil@@ arity of the couple perhaps a reason
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter @-@ U@@ ser@@ in stated their satisfaction , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
actually the U.S. football star Hope solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter an incredibly similar facial form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons of Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and their sm@@ iles , which is almost identical with the act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold med@@ ail@@ ers in the tower of Gab@@ by Douglas , who has its own beautiful , broad smile , resembles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .

C@@ BC ap@@ olog@@ ised at the end of more than 90 times in the people who responded to the review about Twitter

C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology at more than 90 other Twitter users who had proven themselves about the comments of Mac@@ Donald
the network ap@@ olog@@ ated quickly and gave a communication out .
we sincerely regret that these statements were made and that it was possible that it will be broadcast .
last night we quickly apologi@@ ze for our spectators on the shipment and our Fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ n in social media .
to clear one , Byr@@ on &apos;s comments related to the performance of s@@ wimm@@ ers in and not on them as a person .
nevertheless they were un@@ adequate and a miserable chosen formulation . Byr@@ on is doing what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald in the show and tried to justify his remark by stres@@ sing that it was not his intention that it is designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment of time to ap@@ olog@@ ise me for the comment I did according to the women &apos;s family staff@@ el in the C@@ BC Olympi@@ as , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

buyer in Pri@@ mark indi@@ gn@@ ant about women who tried in the middle of the business under@@ wear under@@ wear
the buyers did not know where to see , when a woman moved their clothes in the midst of a pri@@ mark to try shelter .
in order to wor@@ sen the situation , they mu@@ cked as she saw in it , she moved out and put them back to the shelf .
they browse further and pro@@ bi@@ ed four pair of under@@ p@@ ants in a shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping mall in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark Business in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping mall in Folk@@ estone , where the woman gave the under@@ p@@ ants before they put them back into the shelf
a mother of two children , Jenny David@@ son , who was at the same time in the shop , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear , &quot; she moved again and left the business without having to buy something . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the right side , she took a pair of under@@ p@@ ants from the outlet , moved their own whirlpool and tro@@ users and tried them .
&quot; she did not even try to find a slightly discreet spot to do it - it just stood there , che@@ ek like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when they with@@ drew the under@@ p@@ ants that you obviously don &apos;t like it , since they put them back into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three more under@@ p@@ ants before she finally decided that you did nothing , moved and out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seemed not to b@@ other that she watched someone above - or about the person who would buy the under@@ p@@ ants that had tried them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. David@@ son , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; as contradi@@ ct@@ ory to think somebody would take home a different person and which were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
Ms. David@@ son added : &quot; as I have joined , the staff tried to draw the clothes from the sale after she went - which is just as good . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ p@@ ants to go home and find out that another woman had them and again and they were not washed away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident occurring on Tuesday , 9 August in our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from arms attack
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com might make it a bit safer for you .
we talked with Rh@@ on Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ ban@@ des in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers on the distance .
regardless of whether you &apos;re approaching from the front or from behind , this video will show you how you turn around for your th@@ ief .
if you are approaching from behind you , you should look at the top so that you can see your att@@ acker and go out of the bottom line , &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
grab the weapon then between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit it with your free el@@ bows to the face .
then hit him then with the knee into the body and twi@@ sted , while the att@@ acker is merging against pain , the weapon from his hands . strike it with the run into the face and move back@@ wards as they direct the weapon to it .
at att@@ ackers , coming from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the stock line , grab the weapon and spin it , so that the att@@ acker cannot shoot .
transfer the weight to the gun at the same time and beat the att@@ acker to the chest , then turn the gun off his grip before they move back@@ wards and direct the weapon to it .

Reis@@ er Ian W@@ right sch@@ ab@@ t for a guide to the nar@@ row@@ ful locations of Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ went his immune system and wor@@ ger@@ ef@@ le@@ x of a serious examination - by em@@ d@@ ded some of the nar@@ ro@@ wer and ec@@ lec@@ tur@@ est places of Europe .
the present@@ er and travel self Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k re@@ char@@ te his time on a Euro shaft , a rail@@ ed on Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a sink button on the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a sink button and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of its immune system under evidence .
in front of the le@@ ak of each object he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer for himself and to show us what he will get involved .
but the experiment made under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner St@@ allion &quot; brought some surprising results to day@@ light .
the thought that rin@@ se the r@@ ins@@ cription of a draw@@ back , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be totally rep@@ ul@@ sive , but actually there are in a kitchen rin@@ se more bad bacteria .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals on the promotion of intestinal bacteria , as well as his own health .
fortunately , nothing left , what he spot@@ ted , more than a bad taste in the mouth .
Mr W@@ right has been known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ine by jour@@ ne@@ yed through the world and ate peculi@@ ar and wonderful things .
from public funds to railway stations to railway stations to sink of toilets , the task posed his immune system definitely among a sample
in the film he told : &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud . &quot;
in the film he was a reputation in any case .
the only thing he refused , was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its test spra@@ w@@ ed showed a L@@ umin@@ ometric number of over 4000 units .
compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ ometric gains is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to cut off after their L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ri@@ ers over 4000 units was , while freshly sha@@ ken hands one of less than 60
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o produced the Reis@@ ef@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner St@@ ul@@ th , &quot; which shows the bacterial number in different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this comes the worst thing that I ger@@ ed in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing dirty than that !
I will not stop here because it is in@@ doors .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner St@@ allion &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o .
the company manages Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both military and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system .
vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , juices and New categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ kov@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted the consumers really something new .
something that is fascinating to look and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ bio@@ tics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we led crazy brain@@ stor@@ ming by which we ended , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ass us Ian call &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment , the importance of the intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with documentary film we could provide the consumer more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
Tom Hak@@ ala who led the Director of the film , added : &quot; let me tell me so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , when he wanted to instru@@ ct him , just like the ek@@ el@@ ous Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
of course , there were things where it was easier to bring Ian to sn@@ ails and others where this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad that we have recorded some of this dirty goo@@ dies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by 2015 , 84 per cent of all surv@@ eyed l@@ actic acid bacteria , especially with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ine , and 58 percent said that they are using at least occasionally products that contain mut@@ ed l@@ actic acid bacteria .

the walls called k@@ la@@ ff@@ ing holes on , wooden ri@@ mp@@ s were ri@@ pped up , trash has been scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was attached to the walls .
the family have been converted and it is believed that she is now living in a private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for the household management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that the apartment was no longer rep@@ airing .
she said , &quot; It was for the people here an absolute night@@ mare and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to consider , since this property is probably considered as not so beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is in@@ famous and its reputation is also .
the couple had three sons , the only lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror that inf@@ lic@@ ted the family , street ste@@ els with bas@@ eb@@ all@@ ine , intim@@ id@@ ances of residents , drug abuse , drug stores , and excessive cry , stretching and floods .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , received an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house , which is under circumstances be demol@@ ished , old gar@@ bage has been found
they were tra@@ ded in the estate in which in the past drugs have been acted , the wooden feet .
neighbors said that they saw them on the streets and regularly inv@@ oked the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ o@@ gi@@ fted her and her partner this week benef@@ ited by the estate after they gave them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to voluntary .
the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ vers were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbors that said that their lives was made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They turned out about anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we could not sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was here so quiet - we are not familiar !
now , where they are finally gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that there would have been the family to cooperate with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house , to which the police was called regular intervals , 20 years long
on the survived side of the church house , trash and old toys were hin@@ dered .
he added : &quot; it is a shame that there was a ten@@ ant to accept any responsibility for their behavior and their families , as a dolphins is always the last step , Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing takes into consideration .
this was a very difficult case because the behavior was extremely difficult and their deeds had to be aw@@ ful to their neighbours .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the assembly who have coura@@ geous to us and have given us the information to have done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that these developments will push for some neighbours and convey@@ s the message that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they may be all over 20 .
a dirty mattress , which is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ eting on the floor .
worker of the household management will now have to we@@ ed trash @-@ berge that surround the house
in 2014 the police conducted a raid in the house and found about 70@@ g of cannabis as well as Wa@@ ste , Par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ als and cash in the amount of £ 1.@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received a fine , after having found himself guilty of the possessions of a drug in class B in commercial view .
she claimed that the money was a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee skel@@ don , who came to life in 2013 with an automobile accident .
after they were without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and its partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many rooms walls of the house were ren@@ amed with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that they will be ten@@ ant @-@ del@@ ine@@ ate that do not hold on the home@@ order
Angela C@@ row of the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall shared with that the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ vers was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not hold on the home@@ order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can do without self @-@ determination as well as those who were s@@ worn by such behaviour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate crimin@@ ality and anti @-@ social behavior that continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

because the government already passed Kur@@ dish strongh@@ old with criminal actions before months , 500.000 Kurds are within Turkey on the run .
after the put@@ sch put@@ sch there are still sec@@ ular and op@@ position@@ ists ethnic Turks .
many are going to start anew in Europe if they are further suppres@@ sed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that herself takes refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association def@@ aul@@ ted the targeted settlement of Syrian Arab in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities .
this would like to increase Erdo@@ gan &apos;s expression on the remaining Kurds .
&quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been wi@@ ped out or distributed over the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also CD@@ U @-@ member .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association urged that the federal government are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sharp@@ ly like Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany there is a &quot; wit@@ ti@@ hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critic .
in recent months I have no longer feel safe in Germany for the first time .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the flight of many Turks .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and op@@ position@@ ists .
the Brand@@ s@@ ung as Gü@@ len supporters destroyed teachers and other acade@@ mia into the professional existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever does not fit and Erdo@@ gan , the Kem@@ alists also sits and se@@ cul@@ ari@@ sts , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ Close Foundation Dialogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the paper reports on appeal to the figures of the Federal Ministry of Commerce , the Turks already announced the biggest group of the asylum entitled asylum in Germany before the put@@ sch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 June this would have been 11.@@ 3@@ 86 people and thus only under 29 per cent of all being justified as a asylum ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this survey will not be found before war , poverty or a fu@@ tile wage .
asylum entitled to the Basic Law are exclusively political , thus by state side , individually per@@ sec@@ uted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to go where there is we@@ dge &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : locals get nothing from summer @-@ election campaign with - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to vote .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , they have understood .
the country choice will not be held once again at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
because stupid after so far it is not : summer holidays , He@@ at and Land@@ tag@@ sw@@ ahl@@ kampf .
the natives , who are to be convinced by the election fighters are on holiday .
most vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country are on U@@ se@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not locals , so do not choose the country &apos;s day .
for this , practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers , the posters recharge , ballo@@ ons , fl@@ yers and cast out at the end votes , only en@@ du@@ ous .
until 4 September 2016 , the election and last Feri@@ ent@@ ag , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern must once again pass an election campaign shortly before the people .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win S@@ ell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his ministry .
the SPD , since 1998 is the strongest party , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U .
thrilling is exciting , as strongly new@@ bie ap@@ ing af@@ ing and what remains at the end of co @-@ operation .
S@@ ell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 Prime Minister , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive electoral campaign , one sees from his grand@@ parents .
he travels through land , distributed ro@@ ses and ch@@ atting a little with the people , as it did even his legendary liter@@ al predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
otherwise past@@ oral bases have been preserved and the chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel announces the blame on the b@@ los@@ som@@ ing of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ascension of the sp@@ ear@@ est , which will probably cost you the great office now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its head @-@ channel data , the Minister of Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has experienced how it is when you make the wrong time at the right place .
it has been invited twice a chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to the big authority ; Merkel @-@ sw@@ inging circle is located in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not vote , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority of other Länder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compl@@ ained Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is too bad to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel .
otherwise the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U largely wai@@ ves the usual choices of choice on market and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so , Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also the Union has noticed that on the country you sh@@ attered the base , that it must be very strict again to find a wire to the people again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are doing it like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the periods of the country there is hardly any available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the CD@@ U @-@ election Kok@@ ert to his Mit@@ ch is also self @-@ cat@@ ching : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need to go where there is we@@ dge , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Gol@@ dene weddings , any birthday celebration needs to be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because a lot is at stake , S@@ ell@@ ering has now called its SPD to a particularly committed electoral campaign .
in surveys the Socialists and Democrats last with 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just just below the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the election in 2011 , the SPD won yet to be realized with 3@@ 5,@@ 6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , Classifieds , with seven per cent in the surveys , are likely to create the leap into the land day .
they make a modern virtue of the holiday need a modern virtue , and place their election campaign against the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online @-@ election campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it calls the governor of Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , the green electoral campa@@ ign@@ ers start looking for native stim@@ uli among the tourists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the top can@@ did@@ acy , cur@@ v@@ t straight with a house@@ boat through the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ ace of lakes and finds it even nice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; electoral vacation in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ renovation : guest rooms suffer from sper@@ mato@@ zo@@ a
on the speed , with which the B 27 is sandy , there is nothing to complain about .
for the persons responsible for the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 am and will only end up until 8 p.m. , there is no t@@ enth@@ s praise .
&quot; they did everything fairly delicate , &quot; tells El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet pet@@ rol station .
this is a super@@ team .
there is no suspici@@ on .
the construction site was scheduled to move on the weekend to the half @-@ time scheduled to the south until the end of October everything will be ready .
praise also will also be responsible for the construction work , for instance , when it comes to setting up the accommodation .
since the construction site was bre@@ wed on Monday to the south and also the block@@ age of the asphalt road in O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen has been lifted , and thus also the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has been restored , the traffic situation within the place is relaxed .
the citizens are now able to inter@@ fere with O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen from the B 27 again .
the endurance transport through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was partly considerable complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says that for the immediate management of the reconstruction responsible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dep@@ uty chief &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Florian King . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inhabitants of Bach @-@ road , st@@ on@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many sh@@ in@@ ders were searched and rather familiar with their Nav@@ i rather than the signs .
what led to that some truck @-@ cars in residential areas led .
since the speed limit has not been observed , the community also urged to sing the vehicle &apos;s vehicle from M@@ ös@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was considerable abundance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who set itself on the spot over the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two to three per minute have been blow@@ n .
the quick@@ est was on the move with 77 h per hour in the pace @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
since the construction site has continued , but it has become more calm .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 , it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg is now open the road again .
business@@ men are not happy to look at the cards .
however , that the B 27 @-@ renov@@ ations in them has led to sales breeders , everybody lets you look through .
however , some more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; for other companies , for which it has hardly any consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also in the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er speaks Thomas Sul@@ z from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slight drop &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also of course that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the balance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is lacking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the most frequented are the bars along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds significant words .
this is already exist@@ ential @-@ threatening .
not only it but all the hosts have made it &quot; hard . &quot;
it was missing the customers from He@@ ch@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ we@@ dge .
we need to be glad about every euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sales entry at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road marking led its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
half of his staff must be released .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and the half had been dis@@ missed , politics would have acted differently .
instead , Govern@@ mental president Jörg Schmidt on a request from G@@ öh@@ ner would give whether there would be a financial compensation , with the reference , the Gast@@ stätte , otherwise , would benefit from the advantages of the location at the B 27 . now they also need the disadvantages that arise through the rehabilitation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other coun@@ ties where something was pl@@ ain@@ ered .
in all cases , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his guest house will continue .
finally , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history .
that other Stamm@@ ga@@ este is now less frequently mis@@ used because of complicated traffic conditions , he can understand .
if you can not go up , it is also elsewhere .
that his stem cell returned to the end of the refur@@ bish@@ ment , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts .
despite the crisis with BSE and bird gri@@ pping , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of the B 27 @-@ construction works on his customer &apos;s greatest crisis that has experienced his guest house in their long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , that is brutal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the name of the terrorist attacks in laws are constantly scre@@ wed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now a thick@@ ener security package .
but what has a d@@ ul@@ ant status to do with terror ?
and what does the Ko@@ ali@@ tion@@ partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Re@@ öh@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically reasonable , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Federal Minister of Minister for the presentation of his new security office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they do not over@@ call anyone .
others , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
also I was working with me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as an interior , it was placed on the results and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach there has been a little time after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach before he presents its conclusions for security in the Republic .
but the majority of them are all the more extensive .
a lot is already known , announced , stated : that a new security authority is to take care of the bu@@ cket co@@ ded communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , not the fact that Germany must implement several EU directives on passenger data and weapons law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities is also not surprising .
partly , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second run for proposals which have not yet been made with the SPD : he wants to charge sympathy for terror groups under penalty and jihadists with double citizenship , the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; adm@@ its the CD@@ U man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still keeps this for reasonable and demanding even anything that has no odds with the Ko@@ ali@@ tion@@ partner .
a few new ideas presents de Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have partially in themselves : he plans for de@@ port@@ ations and more possibilities for detention of people in front of the de@@ portation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees that are targeted into the country they should check their smartphone in advance and disclose social media accounts for a security examination .
with D@@ ul@@ sions for exp@@ ired asylum seekers , he wants to make some worse than so far - about such that commit pen@@ alties or throw their papers to bol@@ ster their identity .
some of them is political and legal .
man@@ ches also appears un@@ excav@@ ated and leaves questions open .
and in some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of thought , for example - does the question arises : what does this actually have to do with safety and terror ?
yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror .
but it is not possible to speak in dis@@ speech , that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides , many people were worried about high refugee figures about security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and things that are deeply occupied by the people now , were not allowed to cl@@ oned themselves in voting times .
the inner security is enormous in the focus .
first stop in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attack in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the re@@ assurance is great .
and yes , there are electoral campaigns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Union and SPD can therefore play an increasingly position on internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the last days we went high between the two parties .
only a gar@@ le dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons Interior , in which the departments will also call a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from the double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also known here for irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able sounds .
from a return from the double pass he is nothing .
we have sacrific@@ ed the discussion in Germany .
you restart it is not useful .
and on a Bur@@ ka ban , he have constitutional concerns .
whether its own package is constitu@@ ent in all corners and whether it is actually &apos; reasonable &apos; for the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ partner , it is only necessary to show .
there is a lot of dr@@ astic things which might take care of the dispute .
but the SPD is currently trying to pro@@ filed themselves on the subject of internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Part@@ eich@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ aled first with caution and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to increasing security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even by Volkswagen gli@@ de .
despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als are the exchange rates worldwide .
but not in all markets it runs round .
in the recall campaign there is vor@@ tex for a term .
Volkswagen starts with the deliveries further than the second half of the year .
in the past year , Europe &apos;s biggest motorway may still prove to be a plus in the past year , thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ run markets .
but in July the core brand VW was weak@@ ened especially in Western Europe and thus res@@ cu@@ ed the total sales , as the company settled in the D@@ ax company .
globally , the VW brand sold in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year &apos;s month .
only in Western Europe , to China the second most important market , the sales rose 14 percent below the previous year .
in the home market Germany s@@ ack@@ ted the deliveries around almost a six .
bran@@ dy Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weak@@ est figures from July above all at two sale days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it was given in a few key markets with &quot; changed economic framework &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around Putin &apos;s coup in Turkey , the British vote would also be de@@ bit@@ ed out of the EU , explained a speech in .
in the United States , where the car@@ bure@@ tor first escal@@ ated , there is also a minus to be@@ book .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
overall , the mainly affected household brand of the Lower Saxony is still further gli@@ ding through the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months only a delivery minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available .
in January until July , Fred Kap@@ pler could show a sales step from January to July .
1.3 percent more vehicles supplied Volkswagen in this time , 5.@@ 9@@ 04 million .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software subscription .
in Germany , VW calls for 2.5 million vehicles to retro@@ fit into the workshops .
in the course of retro@@ fitting VW , VW , that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after the retro@@ fitting of the vehicles it will yield no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bus station welcomes the customer after the conversion of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate , but don &apos;t speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as it was on Friday in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the reason to be a legal en@@ act@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reports , Volkswagen granted its German customers now a guarantee of low diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have confirmed the last Monday VW representative in the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
the traffic Ministry has been confirmed that this meeting was given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has full capacity of my investig@@ ative Commission and its KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; discre@@ pan@@ cies of this are not accepted , &quot; declared Federal Minister , Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry .
VW has assumed the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor performance after the conversion does not take place and all type of relevant vehicle values have unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen himself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was in the company &apos;s name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; provides Volkswagen the opportunity to come back for example a half year after the conversion round about a motor damage in a workshop - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
also in customer interest , it is important to avoid having any other damage that does not have nothing to do with the scanning sc@@ andal , to an uncertainty about possible warran@@ ties , as it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore VW use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich sa@@ vers in the future pr@@ isons - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or day @-@ to @-@ day accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bundes@@ verband Deutscher Banking speaks of an individual case and does not see it a signal : normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must not be feared to pay for their austerity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
store banks money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.@@ 4 percent of prosecution .
this charge requires the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits over 100,000 Euro on Gi@@ ro@@ - or day @-@ to @-@ day accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 Euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs will be 400 euros in the year , &quot; said Paul .
he had some 40 million euros that could be lifted from one day to the other and which could not be tolerated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.@@ 4 percent costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot put it for every one million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will now give the costs following the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Princip@@ le principle &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cash is easy to leave in the saf@@ es of the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank would be much too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already four survivors &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; I &apos;m not yet the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the ban@@ quet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most customers have had understanding and varied to other investment forms .
only few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative union in Bavaria said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB causes considerable costs at all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you alone have to bear , be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; business @-@ economically permanently not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management , credit cards or instructions .
with offen@@ ders for deposits of three million euros the Thur@@ in@@ gian folk and Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank Alten@@ burg had made head@@ lines with its sk@@ ating bank branch in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , main business leaders of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private clients to pay for deposits , then the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks need much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a banker said , at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , there is &quot; a cli@@ ent@@ el , which is provided by the property a little lush . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bank if it had free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 1911 @-@ founded cooperative bank G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gladly , Kre@@ m@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
in the region are renowned actors , athletes and entrepreneurs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the co @-@ operatives of Bavaria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are currently not known by any further banks that charge a compensation for deposits of private clients , &quot; said Spe@@ aker Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Federal Association of German People &apos;s banks and Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ banks ( B@@ v@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had explained at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go to neg@@ atives towards the private customer , is very , very high . &quot;
the competition is tough , and there is dro@@ ught the emig@@ ration of investors to competition .
the customers in Germany will not like this in the width .
destination plates : who does not purchase records ?
lonely men middle ages love plates .
before you go to the comm@@ ent@@ ative parts , in order to re@@ consider it under the alias of non @-@ escal@@ ation ages with rough ins@@ ults , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the present res@@ ur@@ gence of sound panels is not attributable to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , which would like to welcome the novel@@ ties of physical objects , but to Mid@@ life @-@ nostal@@ gia .
those who have recently bought a record , are all forecast after the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely c@@ ant group .
it is also not a horror by hob@@ by@@ ists - it has an emotional importance : older turn@@ tables retain their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog would be a news report on TV , I would follow the camera , while in the midst of a busy road in Soh@@ o , a modest grey pull and wild , before I ste@@ al , my hands keep and a bit identifiable as : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of So@@ hos is slowly entering its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent sellers were located - there are still a handful of fantastic record stores .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman , to turn the camera for the next part in which I stand within walking distance to various men in such shops and try to estimate their age and minds through observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I was from Si@@ ster Ray ( data number : two young women , three men middle ages ) into Rec@@ cl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men middle ages , a woman , pres@@ um@@ ably around the 20 ) is one day long because of a meeting in London and passes through the shops to fill a few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I already appreciate , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
this sound plates , shown above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail ; I did not follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such considerable numbers of albums and singles , is the result of its available income : it is now able to buy plates , which he could not afford as she appeared and sold again items that he sold , when he was young and ple@@ ite .
&quot; many things I buy , are from the late 60@@ s , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things which I probably was too young to buy them , &quot; he says .
he agrees that those who buy plates , more intro@@ ver@@ ted and happy to spend their own time , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink a lot .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at Si@@ ster Ray , believes that many customers he meets on the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the Medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and let themselves look back to buy their old records .
from the conversations that I have led , people usually have been watching their collection in 1998 or in 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , sell their CDs to get back their records , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom of tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
it only takes a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offers a soothing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers attended the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record @-@ fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw to the stability of confidential sound@@ track , from objects , the lucky Ju@@ gen@@ ders .
&quot; I think , sometimes it can be the filling of a void or the possession of material possessions than a kind of comfort , &quot; says W@@ Z .
that is with me as a collector and I think it is so many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fl@@ aming an employee of a record stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of the IC@@ M in April reveal that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month they have not yet heard .
the survey also found out that 41 % have a record player that they never use , while 7 % of those who do a record , don &apos;t have a record player .
at this time of news report , I would probably look very worried while being bl@@ aded by a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works in sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men middle ages ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy &quot; of Re@@ vi@@ vals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone only recently came here and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not wish to buy a record player , but I would like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ ead record record , so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a large percentage , but it is definitely going on .
more productive , less musician .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older , who will only slowly come out .
F@@ p , which has dedicated the sound of the noise almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience when I go .
there are couples around 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ y and women middle ages .
even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops is - Wild Be@@ ast New@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and far @-@ packed pop instead of experimental jazz reconc@@ iled from the loud@@ speakers - it &apos;s good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them sees son@@ ic lonely , but wet psych@@ ic trau@@ mat@@ a are difficult to determine if one stands next to someone 30 seconds long .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs in business for several minutes and considers the vari@@ ability of the plates available for sale .
it is more of a showcase of a showcase as a big one .
it does not deserve much , therefore the collecting of plates is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to listen to music from a computer or another , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; she drives with a de@@ ar@@ able si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it really is unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban out@@ f@@ itters .
while I give the semb@@ lance the je@@ ans hot@@ p@@ ants to patterns , watching a group of young teenagers , group@@ ing themselves for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are superior to buy a cros@@ ley turn@@ table .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential boards for an average collection .
nobody looks at her - maybe because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to write them .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send into the depths of So@@ hos for more , there is nothing to complain .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates .
even though my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v , let them vote , at least in record @-@ shops in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and record @-@ lovers , which exist in reality , record business and in online research .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with security not with the b@@ aking through recording outlets from Ber@@ wick Street and leaves through plates , while it dominates the rigid view of an un@@ c@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old moder@@ ator , who prot@@ ru@@ des over the shoulders of no means of middle aged men .

French Court re@@ jects the offer of demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camps
a French dish has rejected an offer of authorities in Calais , do@@ zens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais in which thousands of refugees live .
during a court proceedings this week argued that the state should be authorized to sell 72 pro@@ provisional trading , where persons within the bearing goods , sell , hair@@ dressing services offering or tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants .
the Pre@@ fecture of Calais argued that these places should be lower , because they would represent a parallel economy , which no taxes would be paid , and the one fire and stability risk .
humanitarian groups shared by the court that businesses and restaurants are important , as the free meals offered by the state supported union and other groups cannot provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also carried out that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for as@@ signing people who operate the 72 pro@@ visional business , but adm@@ its that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Calais will be absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François Mol@@ la said that the grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just to feed people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas of peaceful meeting between refugees and volunteers offer .
one of the places that was threatened by the defeat was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , the non @-@ profit organization , and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on Asyl@@ um for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ ,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it meant that the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children would be a catastrophe , of which the recent eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants commented on Friday that the number of people in the jungle Living Living has risen to over 9,@@ 000 people - the highest number now - after a steep rise of new@@ com@@ ers over summer .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s razor must adapt to the next generation of speed measurements : in different federal states , among others in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , the tem@@ pos@@ ing of particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic active En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden allows for example to be used on accidents , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example on highway building or to san@@ al bridges with temporary tem@@ bur@@ gers , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that there is a stationary l@@ itter for compliance with speed limit .
a lasting mobile building can be too dangerous or consuming .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : his battery holds five days , the case data is encrypted via a modem .
laser measuring technology can also be recorded simultaneously all vehicles over multiple tracks simultaneously .
variable speed limit and circulation systems after time , cycling and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the highly advanced state you can move the trailer according to the manufacturer using a trailer hit@@ ch .
so that it is not easy to fix , it &apos;s lo@@ wered in the measuring operation , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and also van@@ ish also for safe outdoor gri@@ lls .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm is intended to protect the l@@ itter from V@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 the trailer are tested according to the details of Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used .

great Britain won silver in 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by , after Fi@@ ji Master@@ Class Gold
the impressive performance of Great Britain at 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came in the final hur@@ dle in the final hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were be@@ aten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ aling stage here in Rio .
Fi@@ ji er@@ divided a master class in handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , desc@@ end@@ ings and rotating power to win gold - her first olymp@@ ic medal of any color .
the defeat was reconc@@ iled by the not too bad tro@@ phy of the Silver medal - Great Britain to this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they smote New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ cs , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals on the same day could fall back to them in the finals .
but irrespective of that , Fi@@ ji could have be@@ aten a 15 @-@ man team in a form of a 15 @-@ man team .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it is likely not - that at least a br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal to hang his neck : fi@@ j@@ is boss @-@ trainer Ben Ry@@ an , the former boss for England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult path behind him .
eight years ago , she lost at Ry@@ an each game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this cap is going to do , but the progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji started wonderful and let the attacks GB@@ s out of fun abor@@ tions .
it felt for the captain Tom Mitch@@ ell and Co. at that one would walk in driving buses . the World Series winner went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au went in the corner .
with four minutes of game , Jerry Tu@@ wai added another attack from the right corner , which he walked .
12 @-@ 0 and GB has barely taken the ball .
a pre@@ hen@@ sive t@@ aps of Mitch@@ ell stops the mountain of Mann Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third gate , but it has just stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute , J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a has a touch@@ down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa , added a new since the revival and has still been over a minute of time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ et through further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion took a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it is so , as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB still stopped .
this is how it is .
GB resulted in basic changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for all four minutes , what was good for the circumstances of the first half @-@ time until Joshua went up Tu@@ is@@ ova according to a brilliant stop@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was already running long in favor of the South Cau@@ ans , whose fans che@@ eks and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not hard to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame set the i icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds .
the ph@@ fi@@ ff cat@@ ered , the fi@@ j@@ is embr@@ aced and GB rose nick@@ el cr@@ ush@@ ed in the lawn .
earlier in the days Fi@@ ji Japan had conquered with 20 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 and Great Britain in a kn@@ itted half @-@ match from the race - Great Britain transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ cs in the first half to the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and achieved a gate amongst the post in the second half .
a brilliant late Tac@@ x from Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ coordinate team , secured the prize - and therefore the silver Medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by battle with the cancer of the trainer
there will be no em@@ ot@@ in@@ al gold than in these games and that wants to be hot .
from the first stroke till the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve , who enter into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio since Lag@@ oa .
even though it was only those who were at the ruin , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the Train@@ ers Robin Williams , was all@@ present when she ru@@ ined the second olymp@@ ic in two without any tax law , the first women placed in the history of the British sport that put on such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all her 3@@ 9,@@ ter @-@ made use , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ on who gli@@ ding over the surface with the elegance of spon@@ ge , which does not reflect the type of tri@@ om@@ phe it is reflected .
behind each gold in the ruin there is a batt@@ ali@@ on to help to the incre@@ mental progress which make the difference and there was nobody assistant than the coach , which was not at least 30 months ago if he was able to survive this day when cancer was diagnosed .
as he said , he is risky .
I had bladder cancer who is op@@ eri@@ able and this did it .
if you do not do that , he spreads throughout .
it would have been a pretty narrow situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio had luck that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which was able to start the break down a minimum , in case that in such circumstances the correct term is .
I needed money , so I had to go back again soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet to a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice .
this is how it begins .
the ru@@ stling in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even greater .
in the in@@ exhaus@@ tion of victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a ner@@ ven@@ ous morning to talk a little more than usual , and thus tried to process his own fears .
St@@ anning , which was as captain in the Royal Arti@@ ll@@ ery Reg@@ iment in a deployment in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week a emotional wre@@ ck . that may be something extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
it just reiter@@ ates how much me this means how much I and Hel@@ en and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin , we would not have one , therefore a massive thanks to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have a better person for exercising or a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have no race in the last five years .
the pair had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 metres , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to close , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had a lot in reserve .
we were caught very at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important to not let it take away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking to make some Tol@@ les .
we wanted no fire@@ works today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , going out and win the race what we did too .
the pair will take a time for a year before making decisions about its future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV @-@ advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
this would have too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to comprehend that I am a olymp@@ ic lady .
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
it feels so much better , &quot; she said .
31 years exemplary of clarity for clarity
the managing director of the &quot; V@@ eit@@ en@@ stein@@ gruppe &quot; , R@@ ising t G@@ öl@@ ler , goes into retirement .
the association is regarded as &quot; Bavaria . &quot;
a small fr@@ ame@@ ful drinking water association as a model for the large water producers .
this was the name of the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk some time ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; little later the water@@ forum of the government of sub@@ fran@@ ken announced the appropri@@ ated association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work of the V@@ eit@@ ers group &quot; Bav@@ arian &quot; was widely used as exemplary . &quot;
behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , the 31 year in the special purpose of the staff , it was 28 years as managing director .
he was now retired in retirement at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose association with its headquarters in K@@ ott@@ endorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , promotes approximately 150@@ ,000 cu@@ bic meters of water and supplies 32 locations and hamlets with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member communities are the churches of Kirch@@ lau@@ er , Breit@@ brunn , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Baun@@ ah .
for further cities and municipalities there are water supply agreements .
the current president , Breit@@ brun@@ ns Citiz@@ enship in Ger@@ tru@@ d Dance l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler 1985 was adjusted as water he@@ aters and was already appointed to the managing director of the administration .
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they expanded from water management and maintenance work , household planning , calculation of fees and contributions up to emergency inserts on weekends , &quot; said the president .
as outstanding events , she called the start @-@ up and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , basic piece purchases in the area of the new w@@ ells ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the re@@ establishment of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the re@@ aliz@@ ations of water lines .
there was no stand@@ still standing and you have repeatedly added any changes because water is life wast@@ ed and drinking water the most important food .
in her Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o she pra@@ ys Gö@@ ll@@ ers loyal , reliable and correct service over 31 years away .
he has worked with a lot of heart@@ edly for his water purpose and he has lived up the water @-@ purpose association , as if it would be its own business .
a few weeks ago , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ en@@ stein@@ group for the nit@@ rate group before the sub @-@ forum of the district of Lower Saxony .
for this he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler s@@ one praised water@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons Grie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water he@@ ater and he was a loyal boy .
together we were an unbeatable team .
as a clima@@ xes from its point of view he pointed to the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the re@@ struc@@ turing of the usefulness .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the pipe @-@ break at the high @-@ container at Kirch@@ lau@@ ter on a 3rd of January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the villages could be supplied with water .
also the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained once , because you filled the flood tank of P@@ ett@@ stadt with keywords .
the management of drinking water @-@ purpose was handed down to Daniel storms from lou@@ der that enters the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler .

a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man took place on Friday at 10.@@ 45 in an apartment house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ eide ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on his partner and it is in@@ ju@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man has inv@@ oked himself with us and said to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a pol@@ ic@@ is@@ pre@@ cher@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator be upon the flight , according to him I will be publicly proclaimed .
now nationwide , because S@@ ven S. could be on the way by car .
the man is about 1.@@ 80 meters large , mus@@ cular , brown and has a gl@@ at@@ ze .
meanwhile the police has released a photo of him .
it is however a couple of years old .
in the meantime , the man bears a gl@@ at@@ ze .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still bear the weapon in itself , so the police .
who S@@ ven S. sees , shall call the 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationships &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 .
the competent police in Lübeck first wanted to make no information on the Ta@@ ther@@ ing or the relationship between perpetrators and victims ; but she confirmed that a man had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a red@@ dish @-@ delicate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently not saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a pol@@ ic@@ is@@ pre@@ cher@@ in in Lübeck . &quot; &quot; &quot;

steel - Licht@@ blick for German steel industry
the scratch @-@ coated and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed of additional costs in meg@@ acities .
financial stresses that thre@@ aten the industry from the eco @-@ electricity promotion , are from the table .
it abi@@ des for exemp@@ tion from the renewable energy sources for the so @-@ called self @-@ power production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister of Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am truly happy that we could finally reach negotiations after two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission was therefore planned to ask the steel producer , the gases coming from the ho@@ ok@@ es to generate electricity generation for own consumption , at the cas@@ hier .
the steel industry ex@@ poses additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year according to the German industry industry .
Gabriel said to the WA@@ Z , there is now a manifes@@ to with the EU Commission to discuss talks with competition Com@@ miss@@ ary Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators are replaced in the steel works , all an EEG base of 20 percent is replaced .
but also this will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the EU Commission for self @-@ flow .
in this way the status quo of the previous rule is largely determined .
particular importance have the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel is future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others need to follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of the emissions right are climate and employment targets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IG Metall @-@ Chief Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has suffered under over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis 2008 .
last year , the situation further intensified as the world &apos;s world &apos;s largest producer in China threw up steel on the world market in view of the weak@@ est demand of steel .
European manufacturers throw Chinese steel concrete prize @-@ dump@@ ing .
over the course of this spring , the situation has a little relaxed .
for the one show tra@@ w@@ alled v@@ ault on import steel effect , to the other , the economic prospects in China have stopped .
unclear is how sustainable the prize is reco@@ vering .
the German industry pri@@ mus Thys@@ sen@@ K@@ rupp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last , prices would have been more stag@@ nating .
the industry is responding to difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Thys@@ sen@@ K@@ rupp didn &apos;t want to exclude lock@@ ings of individual works .
in the German steel industry the end of 2015 around 8@@ 6000 people were busy at the end of 2015 .
in July the German steel producer remain careful despite increasing prices and increasing orders carefully .
it produced with 3,@@ 4 million tons of good six percent less cru@@ de steel than in the prior @-@ year period , such as the steel cleaning of steel on Friday .
after a short increase in May the quantity of the second month went back to each other .
since the beginning of the year the production is about two percent below the previous year .
in the coming months the association expects an improved order situation with a rising output .
community , Spirit , Health : singen sen@@ iors good
the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp her whole life : as young girls , she was in the school@@ ing , she defeated the com@@ partment of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; sing me - emo@@ tionally and physically , &quot; describes it .
after a rehear@@ sal it feels balanced , cheerful and overall living , she says .
they do something very well with their health and mind .
for S@@ ingen is the same from several perspectives a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German sen@@ iors .
most sen@@ iors singen in the choir and share with like @-@ minded the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular relationships , sen@@ iors are able to establish and maintain social contacts .
because often , social and family structures are within the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organize themselves to be able to leave and learn from one another - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be stren@@ uous in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
because exercise sen@@ iors are a deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly asks his lungs , even in everyday life is not as fast as the buffer .
even if it comes to preserve the sound of the voice at the age , singing is an optimal hobby .
for older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz about the Federal Labour Party of the Sen@@ iors organizations .
in the older generations the joint singing had a much higher significance , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure , she explains .
L@@ enz often observed that the singing or listening of songs with older men often awak@@ ens many memories , often associated with positive emotions of her youth .
through Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ te and especially melo@@ dies themselves den@@ ying themselves denied events for long back events .
in singing the head is also called a special performance , explains L@@ enz .
at the same time , concentrate on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt themselves to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially elderly , who live alone , practice not only on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through the singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ esteem grows through the singing in the choir .
to show themselves : if I &apos;m long for something , I become better and watch@@ ful beyond me - this experience rein@@ forces .
good reasons to start with singing , so there is enough .
whoever wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he means to have little talent , betra@@ ys L@@ enz .
you do not sing alone - at 50 sin@@ ess people who list@@ ens to hear , when a sound goes off to it ?
in search of the matching offer , sen@@ iors have different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
sing someone from the acquaint@@ ances in a Sen@@ or@@ ench@@ or , one can simply connect .
many cities also offer over@@ views over the choirs in the area .
who wants to sing in an ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ astic choir can turn right into the church or the Church .
many sen@@ iors are also found via the internet .
who has no access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbours for help with the Internet research .
who would like to sing , should join in a choir , betra@@ y H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does the soul good and has something fre@@ eing - this applies to any age .
cats react sensitive as a cr@@ ater on Schre@@ ie of the kittens
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover , which effect the rub@@ les of cat@@ bab@@ ys has grown up on adult animals .
to their surprise the mi@@ xes too did not let the males do not cold - however they stopped in contrast to the females always the same .
female cats can recognize the arousal level of kittens in the little ones of the little ones .
they react at ten percent faster to Lau@@ te of kittens that have been in great distress as scientists found out of the Veter@@ inary University and the Medical School of Hannover ( M@@ H@@ H ) .
cr@@ ater also react on the rub@@ bers of kittens - however always the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apparently , the acousti@@ cal differences between the mi@@ ch@@ ust of less and heavily ra@@ ined young for the males either are not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the M@@ H@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is first authorized in the study that was published on this Friday in the magazine &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
in a previous study the research team had already figured out that the duration and pitch @-@ height of the kittens fri@@ es distingu@@ ishes with the ur@@ gency of its help .
a total of nine adult men and eight females are observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the M@@ H@@ H .
you were played for a rod of babies which were taken for three minutes from the root box and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
to the other they were faced with scre@@ ams of stronger kittens that were additionally raised up .
the researchers keep their results in spite of the low sampling sample .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who had not yet got their own offspring , re@@ acted to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it turned out more quickly to the loud@@ speaker when this herd of the very well @-@ ra@@ ined kittens played .
this ability may be inn@@ ate or develop with the sexual readiness .
&quot; a surprise was that males at all have re@@ acted , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in .
in the past , scientists have already been investig@@ ating the reactions of women and men to baby species .
also , some studies showed that women were sensitive to inf@@ ants , regardless of whether they were already mothers or not , reported the Bi@@ olog@@ in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann .
Po@@ dol@@ ski acc@@ esses with &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ r is a football @-@ legend in Turkey .
in Turkey it was en@@ acted against the one @-@ one football @-@ star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver for Ar@@ rest War@@ rant .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time after Putin &apos;s trial , Turkey will be once again an important football match . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of the du@@ el of the Arch@@ ri@@ val between Pop@@ kt@@ as Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ skis Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya is the official line clearly : &quot; business as &quot; is said . &quot;
even during the suspension of exceptional state after the crash trial in July , the government , the daily life of norm@@ al@@ beit they will not be affected .
but this does not apply to those who are susp@@ ects the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup .
also before the football does not stop .
against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ r , the prosecution issued a arrest warran@@ t .
according to this , the South of America in America will be accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
south@@ k@@ r is intended to be tra@@ ilers of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the President Rec@@ ep Tayy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan for the trial .
during the first 90 days , the state of the Turks is still valid for 90 days , in fact that in the life of the majority of the Turks , however , is as good as no effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the closer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public spaces across the country has declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday for terminated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split in supporters and opponent Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the worker clubs are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
but what the cru@@ de of the Turks , however , given dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military coup .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for g@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or sightseeing .
at Po@@ cal@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala , &quot; it will be especially returning to Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski .
his sporting value awarded the Köl@@ ner in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all the competitions ended the 31 @-@ year @-@ old his first play time as a pot scor@@ er of his association .
in the end game against Fen@@ er@@ bah@@ ce , he scored 1 : 0 @-@ seal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the Po@@ kal season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; found the dis@@ missed season for the record master a conc@@ il@@ able conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the round @-@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League that &quot; lions &quot; is also early in the Europa League early .
in the South by Li@@ g it was only about rank 6 .
the season was not good .
the podium was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have managed and that is the most important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Pop@@ kt@@ as , the game was better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who put the base to the 14 tracks , especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who put the base to the 14th title .
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
in doing so , the B@@ AC Florence under the contract had only announced the bor@@ rowed Gom@@ ez after the trial date , because of the political situation in the country after its EM @-@ holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario yet wants to come to us , he must just say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cl@@ ist Fi@@ cre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the storms would have to reno@@ un@@ ce to reno@@ un@@ ce around one third of his to 7.5 million euros valued mill@@ enium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his sal@@ ary in Florence can we not pay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite doping : these athletes have yet medals @-@ opportunities at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice for D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - Whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova may not start in Rio .
others survived athle@@ tics s@@ inner can only laugh it - they fight in Rio to medals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic of intelligence determines the lines of the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ ova , who had a lam@@ inated right before the games after a mental block , was put out in front of the games at her start ( 100 meters chest ) gn@@ ashing off and bu@@ ked .
it offered a sk@@ ul@@ si@@ cal scene : with a set @-@ up smile she was still proud of the hall and had prov@@ oked it with their appearance .
as a result , they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke into a j@@ ub@@ el@@ storm .
but there are many more athletes , who despite doping past at the Olympic Games go to the start .
here an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversial figures in the athle@@ tics field .
he was already closed for two times ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since his spell the Olympic stadium exp@@ ires from 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion even faster than before , it is more than 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the biggest challenge of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / Jama@@ ica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic Games in 2010 had to sit a six @-@ month lock before taking the ing@@ esting the pain by Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after a surgery you had strong dental pain , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended themselves .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : 2011 was the Olympics of 2012 , World Championship in 2013 and European Championships from 2010 to 2016 are positively tested for the botan@@ ic stim@@ ul@@ ant medication Meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ ane .
Per@@ kovic climb@@ s the wis@@ ely intake and was locked for six months .
the four widest spice in this year go to the account of the big gold fav@@ ori@@ ine .
La@@ sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season ) : the Beijing Olympics and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , was positively tested and has been locked for 21 months .
a means of penis enlargement would have been responsible , stres@@ sing Mer@@ ritt .
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is about 200 and 400 m of the so far fastest man in the world .
I@@ wan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ ing , Belarus ) : probably hardly any ath@@ lete have been recognized as many medals afterwards .
so Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Cup titles from 2005 nine years later , after with him testosterone doping has been established .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to give Olympics @-@ silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid D@@ op@@ ings and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
the also recognized Bronze Medal of the Olympic Games in 2008 was obtained in 2008 due to a judgment of the International Sports Court of Justice CA@@ S .
with 80@@ ,@@ 04 m it is located on the rank two of the world tran@@ sit@@ ing list .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km G@@ toes , China ) : the World Bank and Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin was positively tested in May , but may still start in Rio .
at the 29 year old World Championship , references to the intake of a given dietary supplements have been found , the lock of the world @-@ anti @-@ doping agency W@@ ada fell mild and ran already on 13 July starting .
Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Öster@@ s@@ cher@@ in hurt - Mehr@@ ere T@@ ote
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas K@@ ö@@ ll , Fri@@ ag@@ early .
she suffered schn@@ it@@ tw@@ unden , and be treated in the hospital , but this could already be left again .
she is planning your home trip in early September .
whether from the other explo@@ sions on the vacations of Ph@@ u@@ ket and in the southern cities Sur@@ ate Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ phe , are also affected Austrian citizens , is not yet unclear .
the State Department will stand in close contact with local authorities , so snor@@ ing .
in the approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok Hua H@@ in were first explo@@ ded on Thursday night in a footh@@ ills of two bom@@ bs .
according to the police a Thailand were killed and some 20 people have been wounded , including the Ost@@ ro@@ cher@@ in , three Germans , three low@@ lands and three Italians .
Friday morning we went out again two sp@@ ren@@ ders , so according to the authorities a further man was killed .
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket , a bom@@ bing was reported in the morning .
in the det@@ on@@ ation near the popular seaside beach Pat@@ ong has been in@@ ju@@ red by police references a taxi driver .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the southeast coast of the country then explo@@ ded another bom@@ b , which sle@@ w a city of city .
the explo@@ sives was according to the authorities in a flo@@ wer@@ y flo@@ wer@@ y in front of the cage police into the air .
finally , Det@@ on@@ ations demanded more det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as Ch@@ om@@ phe on the southeast coast several times .
you go from a connection to the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in , it says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bom@@ bing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bom@@ bing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said Dan@@ ai Choice meth@@ av@@ ee Fri@@ ag@@ early in front of journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too early to say to possible motives - probably it is about the deeds of Muslim rebels .
also the Thai media wanted to see a pattern in the attacks , which is typical for the bom@@ bs of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
however , the Thai police , on the other hand , declared the attacks in connection with the Islam@@ ist movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that the bom@@ bs were laid by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
the authorities would have received secrets on upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however they have not been informed about the exact time and places .
still be unclear what group behind the attacks .
the police described their officials throughout the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ usement district .
in Thailand there are always smaller bom@@ bing ra@@ inf@@ all , but they are mostly not directed against tourists .
in Hua H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years of Thailand &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends to make the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on his homepage , to provide the instructions of Thai safety authorities .
high safety risk ( safety level 3 ) used for the provinces Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as pre@@ ah vi@@ val and surroundings .
according to disputes between security forces and Muslim people , there will be no necessary journeys to these provinces .
increased safety risk ( safety level 2 ) used for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were completed a few days after a controversial referendum on one of the military jun@@ ta .
this sp@@ out of the military will also affect the military in the coming years .
Jun@@ ta &apos;s boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said that bom@@ bs have been an attempt to sti@@ el chaos , while the country is moving towards stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism .
the Mil@@ itä@@ run@@ ta , who had taken power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , considers himself to have led the kingdom again to stability and order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the military has not succeeded in getting a grip for many years in the extreme south of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
nearly a year ago in Bangkok , a popular Hind@@ u @-@ shr@@ ines were killed in Bangkok - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody attack of the younger history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the sight of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several congregations , the constitutional prot@@ ector have also questioned the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &apos; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &apos; An@@ clu@@ es for aspirations against the free democratic principles &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said constitutional chief of Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the German press agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the emig@@ rants of Islamic faith or the Middle East are diff@@ used by the Middle East .
that is why we now observe the movement as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of own identity by crossing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
constitutional prot@@ ector in nine Bundes@@ länder - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Nieder@@ s@@ achsen , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - watch the &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular &quot; already .
Ma@@ ate said , his authority has been closely coordinated with the local authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to fetch their target group , where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generally trying to address extremi@@ sts , often with you@@ thful speech , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
Islam@@ ists , as well as right @-@ wing extremi@@ sts .
this is no concrete advertising for your own thing .
the propaganda should address the people emo@@ tionally .
young people are pr@@ one in a special way .
this is dangerous .
recently , it had given reports from several federal states of reports on the &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular &quot; to Af@@ D politicians .
Ma@@ ate said , I have no knowledge .
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species may only be relevant to a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals , the extrem@@ ist extrem@@ ist , its target device changes and so extrem@@ ist .
decisive is therefore whether such individuals have control over the party .
this is not recognizable .
with a view of the clear increase of rights @-@ motivated pen@@ alties and attacks on asylum seekers , and refugee income , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak in this context not of new right terrorism .
but we have found in recent years that there can be ri@@ ster@@ or@@ istic structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the free group .
it can be quite certain that further ri@@ ster@@ or@@ istic group@@ ings or small groups form , the attack against asylum seekers , against refugee camps or attacks from other right @-@ wing moti@@ fs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a clear@@ er or across Europe control is not recognizable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the previous groups were on the regional level or in social networks .
concerned , Ma@@ ate expressed that many transi@@ tions passed to the account of people who were not assigned to the right scene in the right scene .
this is the worrying .
many of the Tat@@ ver@@ ns at attacks on asylum seekers were previously not known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed pen@@ alties , who had previously failed with right @-@ wing right at all , which were perhaps politically in@@ different , or for example CD@@ U , SPD or left , but they have been radi@@ cal@@ ised by far right @-@ wing mo@@ ods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine the Olympics or world lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the coura@@ geous appearance of RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro .
at Aqu@@ atics Center sw@@ am the slightly superior swi@@ mmer from Ethiopia so slow , that he is no longer seen in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the excerpt was chosen .
in social networks he became the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ends with a return of 48 seconds its pre @-@ run and won the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather its not a sporty figure that attracted attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still participates at the Olympic Games ?
Ethiop@@ ians got a special start to the international swimming @-@ association .
this is distributed to make swimming in backward countries more known .
since there are many athletes running in ether , he simply wanted to make something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te makes ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ name made the turn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media recorded it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; RO@@ BE@@ L &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wellness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the English tab@@ lo@@ ids &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about him funny . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time he played only with a minute and almost five seconds over 100 meters of Fre@@ isti@@ l , has not played a role .
&quot; &quot; &quot; compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric &quot; E@@ el &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were also drawn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney , the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i for medi@@ al attention .
unforgettable , the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ atorial Guinea , when he had to compete in an advance over 100 meters of Fre@@ isti@@ l alone .
f@@ ren@@ e@@ tically became M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i back then .
the first 22 @-@ year @-@ old got to swim only eight months before Olympia and had never done a long distance before the competition .

Post increases in trading with electric transport
an elec@@ tro @-@ transport of the Deutsche Post in Action .
the interest of other firms in the vessel is obviously great .
the post office is planning to sell its electric vehicle Sco@@ oter .
the Group will soon plan to start trade with the transpor@@ ter .
the post office wants to offer its electric transpor@@ ter from the coming year also on the free machines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to enter the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;

I can imagine that we re@@ introduce the complete fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter has been active in Germany on Germany since 2014 .
G@@ F@@ K management enters after dis@@ appoint business numbers
the Consumer Research company Gf@@ K de@@ pressed his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the back@@ side suddenly came suddenly - but not quite surprising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the difficult position of the market research company Gf@@ K allowed the chair of atri@@ um Matthias Hart@@ mann , the more uncertain , the longer the successes they promised . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; as the reason for the back@@ itte , the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the long @-@ term business orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details wanted to give a company spokes@@ person on Friday .
who will be able to bring the market research into the market is still unclear .
in An@@ le@@ ger@@ circles , it was on Friday , in the shareholders , would last have been the disappointment about the continued successful re@@ organisation of years ago .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K tip since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the fruits of restructuring are still not visible after 5 years &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business , each ant@@ enn@@ as will eventually become in@@ quiet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this would be the case at BMW the case , it would also make the quot@@ as , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;

accidents - Bus sli@@ pping in Krumlov in dit@@ ch : eight wounded
during an accident of a travel agency with 43 sen@@ iors as riders guests are in@@ ju@@ red on Thursday in Krumlov ( district Aur@@ ich ) eight people .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered serious injury , shared the police with .
the 66 years old rider of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to leave their details according to a counter@@ ing to@@ aster , which took place on the opposite way .
the bus arrived right from the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch as a speaker at police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; because of the location of the bus , the people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; she said .
the fire@@ men liber@@ ate the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ance car and an emergency car came to the accident place on the provincial road 2 .
the un@@ last travelers were brought back from a line bus to the Krumlov district P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the trip .
the investig@@ ators demanded the trucks and potential witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cu@@ bic meters of water will be from 1 October 2016 for the field of se@@ wage system Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl 3.@@ 44 ; for Z@@ ult@@ enberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 Euro ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf the se@@ wage fee will then be increased at the latest if appropriate improvement measures will be necessary .
after a excessive calculation , the se@@ wage rate in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 Euro per cu@@ bic meters .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , was noted during the approval of the budget through the Land@@ scape with Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that for these se@@ wage systems .
the market Kas@@ endorf is committed to a legal basis to operate the plants free of charge .
from 1 October 2016 , citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Z@@ ult@@ enberg have to interven@@ e deeper into the w@@ allet .
the charges are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Chairman of the Herbert Schmidt on the Panel , a re@@ calculation of the fees for se@@ wage systems was necessary .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 they also be over@@ - or sub@@ covers from the previous calcul@@ ating period .
the engra@@ ving bones were founded in Schmidt so that it is possible with all three se@@ wage systems around relatively small facilities with a very low se@@ wage treatment that fly between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cu@@ bic meters per year .
thus , due to the low distribution of distribution , for example , expenses for a necessary repairs of several thousand Euros would be fatal .
furthermore , the waste water supply is easily declined in all three systems .
further in the back period of calcul@@ ating period at all three plants , not least because of their age , they would like to make compensation and repair @-@ applications in a significant extent .
the plant in Az@@ endorf be almost 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sh , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years .
Schmidt rejected that in the se@@ wage system Az@@ endorf , the mechanical ventilation system had to be exchanged due to damage .
in the p@@ umping station Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , the almost 20 year old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led by reason and at the pond base of Lop@@ p , after almost 20 years of operation the first Kl@@ är@@ ch was hidden , the Kl@@ är@@ mud provides and an additional ventilation possibility to keep the water @-@ legal requirements in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , the continued super@@ vis@@ ors and maintenance costs incurred in accordance with the new calcium period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which are still significantly under the current level in the years 2011 / 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; qu@@ arri@@ es clearly made that at low waste water fall into the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , added Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs in se@@ wage systems in the past 20 years has remained spar@@ ed .
the situation for the above plants will continue to remain prec@@ arious on the long run , especially since one cannot extend the supply area of the se@@ wage of Fri@@ esen@@ b@@ acht@@ al around these installations , because it is concerned with de@@ hydr@@ o facilities .
Bulgaria insi@@ sts for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was in July 1 % on a monthly basis .

the annual average of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to CP@@ I -@@ 0.@@ 8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) amoun@@ ted to 0.3 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 amoun@@ ted to 0.2 % .

Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as Asian caric@@ ature has been critici@@ zed
Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e inspired , but some observers say that it is uns@@ ensi@@ bly against breeds .
with his filter tool it enables sn@@ ap@@ chat about 150 million daily users to change the reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that already borders as absurd .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are ins@@ ulated , stand@@ ardis@@ ed tools that produce more than 30 million improved sel@@ dom per day .
all mis@@ appearances arrive to the public .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have been drawn in the past in the past that they were accused of using the app of Black@@ face , or white skin as beauty ideal .
when this week appeared to some users a filter that gave them sle@@ w , false teeth and raised whales , there were some critics a rac@@ ist caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow @-@ sigh@@ ted . &quot;
they asked if these repeti@@ tive controversy sur@@ rendered to a greater problem that the company has with diversity .
the messages and the indi@@ gn@@ ation were widely used on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and motherboard , a day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat , that it would have been de@@ activated .
the company offered an excuse : the filter was thought to be hom@@ age to ani@@ me characters and not as caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ties that have experienced se@@ duc@@ es rec@@ alled the filter to viol@@ ating cl@@ is@@ che@@ es .
other rejected the anim@@ e @-@ comparison .
in an e @-@ mail Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American student student whose comple@@ ments were widely used over the photos , that the filter was hur@@ t@@ ful and eas@@ ed . &quot;
she added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was difficult to argue with the counter@@ position of a very conflic@@ ting Asian caric@@ ature and the filter effects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ sigh@@ ted , but that the yellow @-@ sigh@@ ing was drawn into the descending extreme .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural heritage dra@@ in .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversi@@ fication and integration struggle , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand .
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats big audience young people - who are in terms of race as their older counterparts are - could be more of going to expect sen@@ sibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats filter is a picture that is ins@@ ulting to a user , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is much more difficult to keep such things un@@ noticed when it was earlier the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 25 @-@ year K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer for medium to delete their Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an article for medium and in a phone interview , she said that rac@@ ist controversy sur@@ ges a lack of diversity in the adjustment practices at Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the big part white , only male leadership and ended up their approach to a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that are there , but not in positions in which they are safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint , the Sn@@ ap@@ chat largely un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its staff and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday they refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his staff , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently employed a recruitment responsible , focusing on under@@ presented population groups and on internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu said in turn that she is closed her Sn@@ ap@@ sack account , and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not OK . &quot;
military deployment of ISIS &apos; secret information , presents Committee of Congress
military forces of the United States Central Command have changed information in order to draw an optim@@ istic image of the war against the so @-@ called Islam@@ ist state in Iraq and Syria , when the actual states were allowed on site , a investig@@ ator Committee of Congress in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the force Committee , secrecy and the Wehr@@ budget@@ ary , reports of great dis@@ content among Central Command intelligence agencies , who reported how superi@@ ors changed their estim@@ ations to the American efforts in the struggle against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , shortly C@@ en@@ com , is the military captain in Tamp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military forces in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; message @-@ related information sent by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ mander typically , signed regularly a positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than it had allowed actual states on site and were extremely positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presented a newspaper article . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he introduced Ken Cal@@ vert , republi@@ can , republi@@ can member of the Represent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the executive boards at the Cent@@ Com range up to the top top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi Ar@@ med Forces .
although there was no direct evidence that ruling spi@@ kes under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how an@@ alysts got exposed to the pressure from their precautions , an optimal picture of the threat of the Islamic state , also known as ISIS or Isi@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half year 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before the Congress were clearly more positive than that of the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com was publicly known that a military re@@ conquest of mos@@ is already started in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ su@@ l , second largest city in Iraq remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the months of investigations , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress of Cham@@ bers of K@@ ans@@ as , in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the leaders of the Central Command have changed the retro@@ spective reports to play the risk of ISIS in Iraq .
the Re@@ public@@ ans wars the Task Force in life after them was played and analy@@ st was concerned with regard to the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings during investigations .
additional investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are underway through the General Secretary of Defence in the Ministry of Defence .
democratic members of the message service published on Thursday their own findings , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 the Cent@@ Com has created an over@@ ly restricted process for creating pre @-@ estim@@ ation assess@@ ments to Isi@@ l and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave the highest peak democr@@ at in the com@@ mit@@ ry , member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. ship , in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , so Mr. Shi@@ p , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of downstream reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed the mor@@ als under an@@ alysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave excessive space for di@@ verg@@ ent opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Shi@@ ps and Democrats gave no evidence on an intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ Com an@@ alysts on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certain political opinion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of the congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported of investigations by the governor of the Pentagon , which were added to complaints from Cent@@ Com an@@ alysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ d@@ r. Patrick Ev@@ ans , a press secretary of the Pentagon , gave in an opinion that the Defence Ministry would not endor@@ se any reports of Congress , while investig@@ ating the General In@@ spec@@ tor was still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also gave that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Defence ministry will welcome a controversy about these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have received positive effects on the question of a successful aviation campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a statement that is now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
however , the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest estim@@ ations of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the sal@@ aries on the Islam@@ ist state remind of constraints of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , a writer mentioned under George W. Bush , the recommendations of many an@@ alysts only saw a small occupation in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker after st@@ ating government bodies , that contrary to the statements of the government &apos;s air@@ strikes against the Islamic State of the terrorist group , since these provisional refinement would have taken into operation to sell oil on the black market .
but this knowledge was not published , reported the times in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ pers , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legis@@ lat@@ ure because of its over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin was retired in April in the retirement and was replaced at the Central Command through Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the USA win fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with the UK .
one day after they had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 winner over Japan , K@@ atie made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said , she could not remember that ever did .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I do not belong to the people who keep their gates in mind .
however , it knows however , the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place , which remain un@@ be@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final match of the first lap .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide which of the two teams in their group will gain six teams each from the first and second place .
the first@@ bor@@ rowed will take a little longer out of the path that will lead the other group .
whatever the game may go on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprisingly vor@@ tex due to their success story , four years after they landed over the past London games on the last of 12 seats .
B@@ AM was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania in his hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the National Park of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
it missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 as they could not qualify for the Ka@@ der .
then came the year 2012 in which for her and her team went wrong .
in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham became a British , trainer of the national team and thus began to turn things to better .
&quot; a cultural change , a mental shift and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we did not have the working time in London that we have now .
we have completely s@@ nat@@ ch the rest of the rest .
on Thursday night , B@@ am opened the cake in the first half of the game with a return from the se@@ am .
India has gone into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team showed himself surprisingly heavy and took place from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
they did a Sprint with a flat ball over the left edge , then moved into the middle and airy the ball into the gate to get an 2 @-@ 0 leadership .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ zal@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the door@@ ke@@ eper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just as well as B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .
in the midst of the course of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , how late it is also , it &apos;s the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel safe and inevitable , a rapid stag@@ gering between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is , as if the Olympic tor@@ ch itself would be a burning rod , which is dri@@ lled from the w@@ rist@@ watch to s@@ wimm@@ ers to the gymn@@ ast to the tri@@ ath@@ l@@ eten .
you can not switch the TV to read a newspaper or listen to the talk of your neighbors in queue in the Coff@@ es@@ hop , without using Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ fr@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is a Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s warm with di@@ m@@ ples could quite have been sent under these known names that would be sent to Prime Time by sponsors and bene@@ factors , if he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ asts or even fe@@ eder .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights in the Olympic trampoline for gold .
the olymp@@ ic flame examines not every event the same .
further from the center , partially in the shadow there are sports , which are not generally recognized : air pist@@ ol chery , ar@@ chery , Ta@@ ek@@ w@@ ondo .
we will always have the chest swimming , and may it rule long .
but if I could make modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discreet char@@ me of the trampoline .
although the trampoline has been a Olympic event since 2000 , when it had been in Sydney , the last 16 years was so spar@@ se that many people I asked , did not know that it is at all an Olympic @-@ port@@ i .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the US has sent athletes to competition , it has never won a medal in the trampoline and had a ath@@ lete until the end of 2012 .
the Chinese and the Russians are incl@@ ined to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ on from Canada will defend its gold medal from London this year .
the trampoline has a certain out@@ si@@ licon char@@ me , partly because it sounds suitable for the un@@ resolved ears suitable for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ schule than those for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a ground@@ ed enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ ous potential - the cart@@ o@@ on@@ ous tre@@ mb@@ ling of his never to end clou@@ dy - but also the refinement of the turn@@ around and diving that combines two sports that is essentially united .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means as much as the spring@@ board . &quot;
emerging vi@@ ctors jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , he@@ ets and o@@ dom@@ tos ) before they land on the feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are rated according to the official Olympi@@ ad after the execution , level of difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two thousand athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio against each other .
the most common Olympic vector is straight .
med@@ alli@@ sts have to go further in their quest for gold , faster , upwards and penet@@ rating , sometimes up to the destination , sometimes going back and down , upwards and down to the playground .
they do not only hunt the Zi@@ ell@@ in@@ ie or the source wall , but in television transmission also another cav@@ ity objective : the world or the olymp@@ ic ords .
the pur@@ pos@@ e@@ ful pursuit is no@@ ble , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir up a crowd to tears .
but it is also what I think even when looking at these games than a bit ti@@ res@@ ome .
of this the trampoline offers a re@@ pri@@ eve .
the vector of the trampoline is above .
a backward movement is not the goal .
he or she goes off , seemingly he@@ el@@ os like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effortlessly back upwards .

violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators , demand political changes in Ethiopia , are breaking up to violent resistance of the government .
witnesses say that he was killed in the cl@@ ashes when the cl@@ ashes were killed with the police .
is Ethiopia right together to break ?
during the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid fo@@ e of the West with a fast growing economy .
but in the last few months protests against the government were un@@ wa@@ vering over the country and spread themselves in more and more areas .
last week thousands of people went to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the answer of the government was un@@ mer@@ ciful according to human rights organisations .
witnesses gave us that polic@@ emen were shot at sev@@ enty un@@ armed prot@@ esters and killed .
on the move , the videos are located on the protests that probably are from the last or beginning of this year , show how safety people are young people with sho@@ cks while they were forced to make a hand against a wall .
the Chief of the UN Security Council for Human Rights is now calling for a further investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country and it will be even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiop@@ ians together to fight terror over the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western aid .
Ethiop@@ ian economy expands in the significant pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new swing in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was other than a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continued constantly the repression of the government - the opposition in the country has been limited , whereby dis@@ sid@@ ents were effective at silence .
many were sent to exile or prison , killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and do not have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Central Poli@@ cies .
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
one generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from the floor up to the stran@@ gle@@ hold in relation to the power of the ruling coalition .
after a widespread election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time , the tension rise along the border to Eritrea ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called on June hundreds of lives .
an@@ alysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the Oro@@ mo @-@ liber@@ ating Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which have been more or less forced in recent years , the turbul@@ ence could benefit .
several factors explain why feelings of the bit@@ ch after years of struggle is now explo@@ ding under the surface .
the first seems to be harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media , because cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more common and the internet services improved .
even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular intervals , especially with protests , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that conce@@ al where they are staying .
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave they themselves to be gathered themselves together .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ m and am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ m and am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia , mainly Christian high@@ lands , in politics and economics , while they are the Oro@@ m exploited , of which many Muslims are and live in flat @-@ areas .
but also this is changing straight .
&quot; we are here to coordinate under a umbrella , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of Oro@@ mos .
the largest protests in areas of the Am@@ hara and Oro@@ m took place .
many am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ m have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military , in trade and politics .
the third reason for un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former Reb@@ el@@ ist leader , was until his death on an un@@ inhabited disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian prime minister .
he was regarded as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners .
an@@ alysts say that he was particularly engaged in taking early signs of dis@@ cont@@ ent@@ ment and use special officers to process opponents and make them un@@ harmful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks it at this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen from relatively un@@ sigh@@ ted reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Ireland , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am come from the south .
an@@ alysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the safety services provided by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the outcome will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia has lived such a tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 , after thousands of elections were prot@@ ested , according to the statements of analy@@ st , apparently from the government and subsequently stolen .
while the following swe@@ eps were killed many prot@@ esters , even if there were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
development experts Ethiop@@ ian Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new P@@ end@@ ler@@ er , as well as their measurable progress in poverty reduction .
but obviously this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal Miss@@ g@@ un@@ st of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month , prot@@ ag@@ itation in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ical city , of Tig@@ ray guided shops and the hatred of the Tig@@ ray is becoming more and more important in social media .
an@@ alysts say that the protests in the US and other Western allies bring in a peculi@@ ar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , even if they recently rus@@ hed to close this base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the West does not want to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want his allies to break down in an already vol@@ ati@@ le area . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin crest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp explains his asser@@ tion Obama was founded ISIS &apos; Sar@@ k@@ m .
Donald J. Tru@@ mp tried to dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate the last controversy on Friday that surrounds his campaign by accepting his multi @-@ repeated statement , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State , not seriously meant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this clarification showed new questions about the communication ability of the presidential system of the Republi@@ can public@@ ans whether he is able to communicate clearly and understand the American public . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also brings his co @-@ gen@@ ders to take the effort to take him during an event@@ ful phase , to explain to the peculi@@ ar position , statements , which he could not have meant to be meant .
after he had made the hint at a electoral campaign at Mit@@ tw@@ och@@ evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp was going back in relation to the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS .
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp , he was simply sar@@ cas@@ tic .
the twe@@ et was opposed to the previous day when Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a number of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation completely seriously .
when the conservative radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tru@@ mp wanted to f@@ ade the statement somewhat by destroying it that Mr. Obama wants to destroy it , the Republi@@ can Presidential Senate did not want to know about it .
the last storm of criticism was down to Mr. Tru@@ mp , while he tries to ste@@ er the focus of his campaign due to falling survey assets on the economic situation .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton held speeches at the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp tried again to return to this issue .
referring to Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ ics would make suggestions to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already expressed sar@@ cas@@ m in his defence .
at the end of July he drew a strong criticism to himself when he said , Russians were supposed to h@@ acking Mrs. Clin@@ ton &apos;s emails but explained later in &quot; Natural I told the sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to move the language boundaries in politics and then moved back to your needs .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive , and if necessary , &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who observed the language of both candidates .
but I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of making the sound for the presidential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp has accepted an even more estim@@ ating sound because its re@@ frac@@ tures went further back .
a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , published on Friday a guided tour in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tru@@ mp is generally trying to apologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often har@@ ms his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or to understand his recommendation .
but while he is intensi@@ fying the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s Scher@@ ze have brought his loyal co @-@ ordination to the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements also may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp@@ s prominent inter@@ c@@ essors , had great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think what he says is legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani , so he was asked for the correctness of Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that Obama was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them rear belt , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he moved the troops from Iraq .
most of the mainstre@@ am Re@@ public@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton as an out@@ si@@ ster@@ in served , it was allowed to spread themselves by bringing the situation in the Middle East aggressi@@ vely under control .
before the election approaches in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and cast them up to ride on each of his words , and be taken against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he denied the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , j@@ äm@@ mer@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can not ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the Democrats &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Tru@@ mp@@ s sorry about Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s sorry than just another evidence that it was in@@ appropriate for the presidential ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
once pushed for the price of the market , café is coming back in Green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a s@@ hab@@ itation café in Williamsburg , where you could pay only cash , which no Wi @-@ Fi had , but for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices of his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ Front has been displ@@ aced .
the shop So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , the verb in summer 2014 er@@ ased , sells soap in the form of C@@ up@@ cakes .
indigenous people saw it as last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fied city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ iner wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I can still not believe CB@@ GB dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap @-@ shop . &quot;
but if New York change is , it is also new discovery .
a rev@@ ital@@ ised Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepted credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ time employee of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new cafes .
he began to work with Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when he had offered a customer to provide money for a new out@@ post , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , be@@ held much with .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the excav@@ ation bought the same es@@ presso model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he wanted to experiment as well .
he led new ingredients .
on the menu you stand sand@@ wi@@ ches with bac@@ on and che@@ eses and there are Gar@@ ni@@ ys like cap@@ ers and sau@@ ted oni@@ ons .
there are natural re@@ iss@@ ing bow@@ ls .
the café does not serve beer more , there are fresh juice .
after nine months Rodri@@ guez said that he noticed a st@@ acked current to old stem customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also pushed aside from Williamsburg &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived earlier in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly .
even after having moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way .
after the verb closed , she gave a while the coffee shop , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was clear to me that it was on the coffee and the culture in the verb he liked &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they drink coffee again , even if they ordered an aper@@ ture C@@ hai Tea with this day instead of another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ standing customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003 .
he went there before work and ordered inevitably to be the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket clock and they prepare my Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
today Ros@@ enthal always gets its usual place , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he won &apos;t have a gro@@ ll that the soap business has taken the old business area .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ ery offered a special soap for verb with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the cafes as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go to their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu in Polish and Rodri@@ guez said that he has presented them soon , so that his new neighbors will feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice @-@ locally would like to fill the cold coffee to the bottles and sell them .
there is a chance that the café is expan@@ sion@@ ed on a regular building .
for many customers a new verb is enough to get their old favorites .
Joseph WI@@ TT was Chief @-@ Know and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the entering of the local and the best@@ os had a new coffee as a home@@ coming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to sprout , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; an abundant meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his climb to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano Roos@@ evelt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Roos@@ evelt had a f@@ ai@@ ble for in@@ geni@@ ous delic@@ acy to Fi@@ fth Avenue as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland Wasser@@ sch@@ ild@@ o@@ supp@@ e .
his menu on this day was a little modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , potato p@@ ushes and as dessert a p@@ fl@@ au@@ men@@ p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histor@@ ies .
Co@@ p Last Book &quot; Cho@@ p Su@@ ey &quot; was formed by Chinese cuisine in the United States while Zi@@ egel@@ man told her book &quot; 97 Orchard &quot; about life in a residential home on the Lower East Side from the food perspective .
their latest co @-@ operation , &quot; A decent meal &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in the Har@@ per publisher , illustrates the history of American cuisine while the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity , when they meet with a re@@ porter in Eisen@@ berg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , car@@ ör@@ k@@ ell@@ os@@ em Im@@ bis@@ cus in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the IP@@ O 1929 in the shop .
brick , 54 , ordered a fresh k@@ es@@ and@@ wich with olive trees , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with potato p@@ ushes and green@@ mixing ate .
when the re@@ porter h@@ ates ordered , this took the pair for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was Erd@@ n@@ uss@@ bro@@ t , Leb@@ se and B@@ ohn@@ en@@ bro@@ t .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little tri@@ l@@ ent that ble@@ eding the ingredient .
imagine so many pe@@ an@@ uts to eat that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ e gr@@ in@@ ste .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have placed in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression was the table in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women bo@@ iled for male field workers and it was freshly baked past@@ ed for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ing Europeans during the first World War . &quot; A Square &quot; draws the paths towards which the land went with it to be no more the black@@ out of the land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when eating for Americans was a central , tense theme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; talented Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as tense was the new Bud@@ di@@ ode : mysterious foods such as lo@@ aves and Kas@@ ser@@ ol@@ len have been a stap@@ le food , the Kas@@ ser@@ ol@@ le , as a &quot; wonderful way , food @-@ remains re@@ treats , &quot; mer@@ gers Zi@@ egel@@ man , because coo@@ ks un@@ appe@@ tizing ingredients were able to hide under a cr@@ ammed Sau@@ ce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap drying tables .
meat , for years the center of the American cuisine was , became a rare luxury .
peculi@@ ar mi@@ xes have been tried , because a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nour@@ ishing satisfaction has priority before taste or even healthy kitchen .
during their research for the book , which includes recipes , prepared a dish from this epoch , baked oni@@ ons with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular addition on the mid@@ day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man continues to pass : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked oni@@ ons do not fit each other .
it was typical for many of the home recipes .
as never before or since , exagger@@ ated household sales - including Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country such as such .
by sending recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , encouraging women to become &quot; household policy &quot; and the challenge , Pamp@@ e like cre@@ am@@ y sp@@ ag@@ h@@ etti with car@@ rots in delicious meals to transform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A Square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a celebration of historical le@@ ak . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially tasty are the reports of the response of the government to star@@ ving citizens , like President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ food @-@ attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa peasant cuisine of his kitchen , he p@@ est like the million people of the world to which he has become .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in an almost g@@ ild@@ ed dining room and contributed a smo@@ king .
he was delightful realistic .
President Roos@@ evelt could have been committed to the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have prompted him to stat@@ ure his stomach with his stomach .
as described in the book , the an@@ alogy described a house@@ ke@@ eper with no interest in tastes by Ms Roos@@ evelt , that the White House brought the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most relaxed . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , deal with food , was rejected as soon as the land came back to the legs .
the Legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as to how science was applied to foods .
the pair gave to the writing of the book the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man in law to have understood better - for example , how they could not throw food out .
&quot; she had a real fear of the extravag@@ ance of food , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not really sick people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were the wind of the wind .
after the plates were vac@@ ated at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s , they moved and co@@ e a dessert that had prepared them at home : the plague , the president Roos@@ evelt took lunch .
&quot; there is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man , and added that it was a nasty trick , humble also send a name to miss .
there was no s@@ worn cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and c@@ innamon .
each di@@ pped slightly rel@@ u@@ ct@@ antly a spo@@ on in the tough , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
surprisingly enough , it does not make it bad .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died on a bom@@ bom@@ b attack by the Assad regime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Hel@@ met , &quot; a civil protection group , who previously saved the life according to picture @-@ newspaper nearly 60@@ ,000 people .
2@@ 900 volunteers are putting their own life into the game to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to make first aid in the war area .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the civil guard , which shows it from a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a baby from the ruins of a house , went to the world .
it made the Syri@@ ans for the shining symbolic character in the Gre@@ ys of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a hero he has never seen himself , said according to image : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me that is the true Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die to save life , I think that God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just before O@@ mar himself fell victim to a victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ bing ra@@ ids in Syria .
the Heli@@ kop@@ ter have rejected four fac@@ bom@@ bs over the IEC adia district , one was filled with chlor@@ ine gas .

Greenland : the oldest spine is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland - usually only in winter to surface .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an examination on board the s@@ aut@@ é p@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a good 1 km / h by the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland only got up with 150 years of offspring .
in common , the Greenland is along the ground of the North Atlantic at an hour , it is an average of just 1.@@ 220 meters far .
only when it arrives , the five meters long animal acceler@@ ates at sat@@ te 2,@@ 6 km / h - and with this maximum speed is half as fast as a robu@@ st@@ ness .
this of long @-@ term li@@ festyles seems to be a pan@@ ac@@ ea for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science &quot; at least from a Greenland , the 3@@ 92 years old could be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ins@@ anity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ erle@@ e of the Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock this life span that means for vor@@ tices a world record . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the evolutionary bi@@ ologist already suspected that Greenland become stone old .
only missing the evidence .
Greenland are difficult to observe , after all , they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sk@@ inn@@ ed coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Sv@@ alb@@ ard .
because they prefer water temperature around the six degrees Celsius , they usually dive on the surface mostly only in winter .
about the lifestyle of Greenland know researchers according to little .
her tim@@ lu@@ pent@@ emp@@ o gau@@ ges , when they threw up six animals in front of the Spit@@ s@@ bergen six animals with a transmitter .
loo@@ t make this shar@@ ks nevertheless : in the stomach of a beast , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had the j@@ aw @-@ bones of a young ice @-@ bears swal@@ lowed .
possibly they hunt sle@@ ep@@ y animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the Eis@@ me@@ eres and are looking for Kad@@ aver , which tor@@ ques from higher water layers down .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Sv@@ alb@@ ard as a catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimeters long , while the biggest 5@@ 02 cen@@ timet@@ res measured .
to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens @-@ 14 method the lens of shar@@ ks .
this centre of Oph@@ thalm@@ ology is already created before the birth of shar@@ ks , which contained in it later no longer be renewed .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had stri@@ k@@ ingly much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens .
their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s than nuclear weapons try large amounts of this radio@@ active carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
in the length of 220 cen@@ timet@@ res length of the third animal de@@ pl@@ ated the lens with a small over@@ shot of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
all major Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie had normal carbon @-@ 14 @-@ amounts , which arises from cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed for a 4@@ 93 cen@@ timet@@ res long Greenland at an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record shar@@ k with 5@@ 02 centimeters , even 3@@ 92 years is likely to be .
that Greenland females only get offspring if they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers could assign an age to the length .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimeters probably on the br@@ ink of sex mature and its age with 156 years was determined , Greenland can obviously become at least one and a half centuries ago .
also this should be for cycl@@ ist currently Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord .
that such meth@@ ane conditions live above all in e@@ isi@@ gen waters is no coincidence .
also the previous record holder , a 211 year old Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ wal , in whose bac@@ on at the neck at the neck had put up a 120 year old resin @-@ tip , was caught Alaska .
due to the low temperatures often the organism of the animals living there live on austerity .
so they mature later - and slower .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are also often very large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface , by which the animal temper@@ ate heat .
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much greater than in one gram@@ mes elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on as many descendants as early as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the evolution of evolution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , a very large animal should invest their resources more into a long life .
basic background in the double pack
with topics around Bau@@ en , the community at the recent meeting has been focused on the point of view .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the Panel assumed the communication by Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , the marketing of the tap@@ ering can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the property management , Par@@ cel@@ er@@ - and Ex@@ am@@ ation issues clari@@ fied and the applications must be clari@@ fied , the sale of the land in the residential areas of &quot; street weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße - Ex@@ pl@@ under@@ cut 1 ) to prospective buyers have nothing more in the way .
the common der@@ at is convinced that the streams in the rural and peaceful residential community Schön@@ au young families and other sen@@ iors alike .
as it says , Baumeister may register immediately in the city hall , on the allocation of the plots will be advised in his September session .
in order to also apply requests for the relocation of other industrial companies , in the creation of jobs , decided to sign the council , decided only in the spring of this year re @-@ created space plan in sub @-@ areas .
thus , in the area of under@@ going @-@ lar@@ n that is already been established there , in order to extend two plots towards the direction of Staats@@ straße 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
the city on the Main is therefore in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg the best chances to move from London to attract jobs and companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt am most benef@@ ited from the Bre@@ xit &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the Competence of the financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ xit @-@ referendum , it is uncertain whether monetary policy continue to operate from London from financial transactions throughout the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the so @-@ called EU passport , they have so far enough approval in Britain .
this is just a big US @-@ banks .
several banks have already announced jobs to leave .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calculated with 10000 new jobs at the Main , five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , united the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities like the European insurance policy EI@@ O@@ PA and the risk ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) have been headquartered , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the note bank is important for banks since they can communicate so directly with the supervision &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg although a large fund industry , cuts , but also like Dublin in the infrastructure was worse .
Frankfurt am very easy to reach thanks to the big airport .
furthermore the city with easy available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the Seine , the rental for premium commercial properties are also 50 percent higher than the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt am offering a higher quality of life than competition , thanks to good medical care and infrastructure , as well as less crimin@@ ality .
in a rank@@ ings of the consultancy Merc@@ er , the city is ranked No. 7 , Luxembourg on square 19 , Dublin , in place 33 and Paris in 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if the quality of life is a matter of predi@@ le@@ ctions : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the I@@ W &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but London despite Bre@@ xit will remain the most important financial center in Europe despite Bre@@ xit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economic &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also speak the power relations : in London according to numbers from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , at the end of 2015 approximately 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking industry , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead gets legal costs from the hep@@ atitis C patent @-@ it with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. office decided that Gilead Sciences Inc are entitled to reimbur@@ sement the right costs that you have emerged from the hep@@ atitis C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was released by a claim rep@@ ay@@ ment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which stood in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster medication So@@ val@@ di and Harv@@ oni of Gilead , after a US judge covered a pattern of mis@@ conduct by Mer@@ cks , including Mein@@ ei@@ des and other unpleasant actions , covered .
in the collection of the law@@ suit on Thursday , U.S. counter@@ ri@@ vals in Bethel said Fre@@ eman that Gilead is entitled to decre@@ ing the cost , which were created during the defense of the case .
Mer@@ ck is trying to tigh@@ ten with Gilead that dominates the market of a new generation of hep@@ atitis C medicines that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver illness .
the case dates back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck gave each other def@@ endants and property of lab work , to the Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the medication of Gilead .
the troops supported by the USA that they re@@ conquered complete control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under perfect control , but we just conduct elev@@ ators working through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Re@@ uters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ ics earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and will pay 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % Bundes@@ ste@@ er
Hill@@ ary Clinton publishes on Friday their tax return for 2015 , which revealed for the presidential and democrats and her husband a income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax of 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % .
in 2015 , the Clin@@ ton USD 1 Million for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; the former President Bill Clinton had issued almost USD 5,@@ 3 million in phrases ; the former State office gave an income of USD 3 million by Verlag Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book on the State Department of Foreign Affairs .
Clin@@ ton Candi@@ date for the Vice @-@ Presidents , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton his tax exemp@@ tions of the last ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax of 20,@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ins continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clin@@ ton Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ hel@@ fer@@ in Jennifer Pal@@ mi@@ eri was known in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a stark contrast , Donald Tru@@ mp is hidden behind incorrect expressions and back@@ ups in relation to his previous promises to publish its tax exemp@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is common for US presidential data to publish their tax exemp@@ tions , although they are not obliged to do so because of the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have given the reason for its denial as a reason for its denial by tax authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clin@@ ics &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , in relation to the publication of the presidential and Democrats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tru@@ mp@@ s special advis@@ er to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to publish something before the tax tests are not finished .
Tru@@ mp@@ s critics , among other things also the Republi@@ can presidential can@@ did@@ acy of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already mis@@ cellaneous that his ref@@ usal questions arise in terms of assets , his donations for charitable organisations , its commercial and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already been over@@ thrown on the subject and published on Friday a video on the Internet , in the high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tru@@ mp call for its tax return .
on Thursday she spoke the subject too during a speech about the economy in Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refused to do what any other presidential did@@ did@@ ate has done in recent decades and release his taxes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poli@@ tico has reported that Tru@@ mp has paid no or less taxes on Friday for two years , and an economic set of New York Times cited a series of tax evasion and tax advis@@ ers , the indications that this could still be the case .
states have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , who would make sure that individuals earn more than USD 1 million make a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama supports the proposal also .
during a voting event for Hill@@ ary Clinton in the past week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka requested Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate here has its seat to exchange Tru@@ mp for a meeting in order to exchange their taxes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has been subjected to a tax examination of I@@ RS and Tru@@ mp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against the voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ ton Camp@@ a@@ ign has released fiscal return from 2007 to 2007 .
the Clin@@ ics which now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an average of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % .
the Tax statement of 2015 showed that this only USD 100 of its income compared to wage , unlike the majority of all Americans .
their main terrain was a cost @-@ effective Inde@@ x@@ Fund from which the Clin@@ ics dividend and income of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 .

natur@@ alist in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from being inhabited by people - they throw con@@ doms on them , which are filled with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ ce .
the method has proved to be effective and the Honey@@ guide Foundation that had already intensified years ago together with the U.S. conservation , has trained to use volunteers in villages in the north of Tanz@@ ani@@ as , a non @-@ violent four @-@ stage method to protect their homes and harvest without hurt animals .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle , we welcome new tra@@ des@@ men , but at this location in a prime location on the Rhein@@ u@@ fer , this ki@@ osk does not fit &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director defe@@ ats Berlin hotel , because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; Arabian &quot; invitation - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media watch after he betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin has no Israeli pres@@ election , since the Arabic guests would have requested according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lan@@ z@@ mann , author of the Holocaust @-@ documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; led his sle@@ eves in the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay Lan@@ z@@ mann had tried to find Israel on the country bank list of the hotel .
however , the country had not been listed among the countries which can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it in the year 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lan@@ z@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center .
after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel &apos;s reception .
the answer he received there , &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; as Lan@@ z@@ mann wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel asked that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clear decision of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kemp@@ inski Hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason that stood behind it was even more anger in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was cited by Lan@@ z@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli ambass@@ ador to Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Commerce called this a &quot; great shame , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were depri@@ ved of this event and frigh@@ tened .
this is really very sh@@ ame@@ ful .
the fact that this has worn in Germany in exactly this hotel chain , is even greater shame .
this requires no explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident extingu@@ ished a fairly large resonance in the internet , in which people sho@@ oters the whole of a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some signed the Kemp@@ inski Hotel in the Kemp@@ inski Hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed you , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said in another article in which the hotel , which is located at the pos@@ h Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly pointed all the accus@@ ations of themselves and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ver@@ t &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; ap@@ olog@@ ised &quot; at Lan@@ z@@ mann , reports the mirror . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Israel did not enter into the quick@@ est list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited the South German newspaper a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country @-@ election has now been added .

students turn together on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo , when they gathered together to demonstrate against the reforms of the government for the public educational system .
the police put Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties started as police officers tried to dis@@ miss the students , which led to the police of rubber and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
according to the proposals made by the governor of the State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300@@ ,000 students will be implemented to save money .
some of the protest participants saw gra@@ ff@@ i@@ boobs against the preliminary President of Michel T@@ emer of walls .

trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rise to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambass@@ ador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade union between Moscow and Teheran in the annual comparison to 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the international sanctions imposed on Iran , the interest in Russia grew strongly in businesses in the country , shared by the ambass@@ adors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian companies have existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
of course , the further commercial expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan .
he cons@@ ulted that the trade union between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 increases and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , the Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 per cent , and prevailed in $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the commercial swing was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambass@@ ador .
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes out for this year from a record of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , Russian foreign representatives were awarded about 3@@ 5.000 Vis@@ as , primarily as Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , an Iranian citizen .
furthermore , Iran reached the top 20 countries , which concerns the tourist number in Russia .
one could say that the record @-@ record tourists in Russia will be broken from the last year , &quot; he said .
at the same time , only relatively few Russians are visiting Iran , something from which the Ambassador hopes to change .
&quot; I personally recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , to receive the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .

England had four years ago a sho@@ cking victory , while Ho@@ y captured the fifth of six olymp@@ ic old@@ med@@ alli@@ ons .
they repeti@@ tive the trick after they took place in March by train World Championships in London despite the recall Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie staff .
they did this in time as a reference .
Ho@@ ys retirement created a gap , the Ki@@ an Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man who remained when they saw the potential in the br@@ isk which has now developed .
Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - who set up four years ago with Ho@@ y and Sk@@ inner took a Olympi@@ ad in the qualification round a olymp@@ ic record , but in the stand@@ ings won the New Zealand in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
he was just going back after his round , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a strategy of strategy made a big part of transformation to slow down in the execution of a higher course to slow it and allow it to keep it Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y saw from his position as the BBC expert and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der , when they got on the podium .

I am just here to do my best and make me a name .
we have conquered a Olympi@@ ad and conquered the World Champion in the En@@ dr@@ yers .

he returned this statement later and there was no objection of England ri@@ vals .
this time has not been a problem with such a victory for victory this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels with the whole GB flags on the tri@@ b@@ une like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , the seven of 10 titles , both in Beijing and in London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect a successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
in the form of passwords it is in the field of possible that he repeated ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three olymp@@ ic gold medals in a competition .
that would be born for Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a apparently holy date for British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster ) - a explo@@ iting of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the ch@@ me of the Ho@@ y equals .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this just for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he wins two further gold medals , he should be be@@ aten to the k@@ nights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ alli@@ sts of the day , but there were further good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ z@@ Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the Vi@@ er @-@ four @-@ o@@ dom@@ eter race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 at the destination .
the World Record , which won in London in 2012 was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held today on the second day of the competition , at the Wig@@ gins of security in the focus .
he had st@@ oked himself with the qualifications before the qualification as the function@@ aries came to itself to measure his body size .
in the appropriate women &apos;s competition , the morning continued and ended , av@@ anced Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ soon of Mil@@ n@@ gav@@ ie in Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord@@ era in 4 : 13.@@ 260 .
the GB team leaves itself on its strong track wheel team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to pick up a scar@@ ar to medals .
after a truly exceptional presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London have driven the expectations for Rio .
it also played drama in the background , as the res@@ ign@@ ation of the technical Leit@@ ner Sh@@ ut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex@@ ism and har@@ b@@ ing@@ es , as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on .
however , if you look at the first evening of competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite then , it could now be the legendary reputation GB@@ s , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment .
the future of the mel@@ ting of Port@@ land on the basis of lifting the energy order
the future of the aluminium mel@@ t@@ down from Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand on the game , as the plant operators terminate the energy supply contract and thus raise all the delivery contracts , such as the delivered energy companies .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to the operation of the plant .
a scheduled payout for 20 years is scheduled for a period of 20 years .
up to 2000 jobs at the plant of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
no less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be endangered in a closure .
in addition , it could come to Domin@@ o@@ effects as the mel@@ ting around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as consum@@ es .
in 2014 Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry mel@@ ting , which led last year to a closure of the fro@@ es@@ ea power station .
the mel@@ ting range of al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risk a closure .
this move follows the long term spec@@ ulations of the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian Dollars and finally due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the big aluminium mel@@ ting with his Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , shared that three other owners announce their contracts .
the complex is in the majority of a joint venture of al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company CI@@ TIC and Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Corp are holding small shares .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant in Port@@ land continues to be operated , which means a further physical demand for electricity through the mel@@ ting means , &quot; shared the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continues to be that the Treaties are so called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; backup transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which should come into force starting November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month period of notice , so that they will end 2017 .
&quot; from therefore , AG@@ L assumes that contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenue , &quot; said the current supplier .
all potential implications for the revenue on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong dates for major retail prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L shared with the value of contracts already written in his annual ab@@ out@@ us in the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ation of a cancellation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the Treaties , the &quot; capability Al@@ co@@ as ... the mel@@ ting power to operate or to ensure the power supply to the mel@@ ting . &quot;
the U.S. company said that 2010 has concluded a 20 @-@ year treaty with Lo@@ y Yang , which should have entered into effect from November this year , even if there is still a statement ple@@ aded why it is returned from the contract .
analytical warn of the poor economic circumstances of the industry before the possible closure of the port@@ land mel@@ ting in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near Newcastle .
in reference to the statements by the analy@@ st at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen , that Port@@ land was going to consume around 600 me@@ ga@@ watts and Tom@@ ago about 900 me@@ ga@@ watts of electricity .
should both plants disappear from the market , this would mean considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
and for us as a generator , it would not be good , &quot; he said .
more than just a Kar@@ ol@@ hi@@ on@@ Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , Kendall is available on the Cover of the Vo@@ gue
Leon Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and 4th daughter of Man@@ ag@@ ine and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner Cl@@ an Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted sep@@ em@@ ber@@ re@@ ation of the US Vo@@ gue .
Kendall , the brand ambass@@ ador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der is and ran on Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ ag@@ ram account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , brought me the sight of this Co@@ vers for crying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unveil@@ ing of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ sen family ( except for the problem of Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ tery ) , as they forget the cover of her sister and ends with a classic twist : they all have a surprise party planned .
this makes the kl@@ is@@ che@@ ek@@ ee@@ able action almost every birthday given to a children &apos;s post@@ ure ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; you were told that we had forgotten you ? &quot; with the honesty of a cartoon by 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to take part in these publicity .
with a view to the history of the Vo@@ gue , certainly a new era of the Car@@ di@@ ans began .
Kend@@ alls great sister Kim likes them , which has be@@ aten the Vo@@ gue cover , be@@ aten ( she and her husband Kan@@ ye West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the Cover from the magazine is a league for itself .
the sep@@ tum is for vo@@ gue most commonly used output of the year .
with a circum@@ ference , that resembles rather an image magazine than a fashion magazine , the output draws a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ist@@ a were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the ram@@ p 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the unveil@@ ing of his Co@@ ver@@ stars is so fores@@ een that in the last two years the magazine shows the official announcement even before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover , include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ist@@ a and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ rities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mod@@ alities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the celeb@@ rities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar @-@ Prei@@ str@@ ate and di@@ or @-@ brand ambass@@ ador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had honor .
but even at the low chance that Mrs Jen@@ ner - which is described from the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of their generation - under the earlier category , it is in good company .
these celeb@@ rities are not related to famous people or reality stars or te@@ ens from today who know how to turn a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even if all of them apply to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who are engaged in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had some of the most successful years of their career with the release of L@@ emon@@ ades .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers do not like success every time .
with her reality @-@ TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers was always somewhat tense in the fashion world .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called her &quot; the mi@@ xes of the moment . &quot;
these feelings co@@ ats up again when the message with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers came out on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but on the dis@@ grace , it seems to walk along the point .
Kendall Jen@@ ner is on the Cover of the Vo@@ gue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a super@@ model .
it runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
they and all their sisters will sell you pictures of themselves on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
they sold from her made pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Craw@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is in reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
community centers show 160@@ ,000 people per year
more than 160@@ ,000 people in the country are reported annually by the community centres , while the industry was taken on the effects of other mid@@ scale transactions on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Queensland , three of five persons - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence did and those who have no means for un@@ just Del@@ o@@ gi@@ erungen and those who have no means for un@@ just delay Del@@ o@@ gi@@ erungen and those who are looking for free legal advice and legal proceedings .
legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ crowded , are ready for further cuts .
starting June next year , these legal centres will lose 30 percent of their federal states .
the director of the community centres of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last collection of the National Association of community centres discovered that thousands of people are rejected every year .
Far@@ rell said that the government would only be worse without lifting the decisions of the Federal Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; que@@ lands community centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means thousands of people of important services you need to be rejected &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and impressive debts , families who were dis@@ missed by separ@@ ations , workers , the un@@ just way - all these people have problems of a legal manner and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need .
the Federal Government will cut funds for 30 percent as of June 2017 , which means that thousands of helpl@@ ess people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
we call for the General Secretary General and Federal Minister of Justice and the Federal Minister of Queensland , as well as Sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis , to up@@ lifting these medi@@ ations as soon as people need the help they need in legal problems .
last year , the national government fulfilled its commitment to up@@ lift funds for right @-@ wing progress on the national average .
it is now at the time to look at the needs of community centres and their client communities as well as the government Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k to invest in this important work .
Donald Tru@@ mp campaign indi@@ cted by employees supposedly drew a weapon
new York : Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s Camp@@ a@@ ign was charged because of inn@@ y in@@ activity since you have been informed that their campaign manager for North Carolina have been directed towards an employee while they were in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment which was submitted on Wednesday in the Landes@@ gericht of Charlotte by Vincent Bord@@ ini , a former software programming for the campaign in this federal state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bord@@ ini announced that the matter would be governed internally before it realized that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the campaign manager , Earl Philip , &quot; drew a pist@@ ol , placed his right pointer to the de@@ duction , and r@@ amm@@ te the run in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; called Bord@@ ini in his indictment .
having committed himself to the local and regional campaign management , Bord@@ ini proved that at least four more people had had the same experience with Phillip , he was in the bill of indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be frozen , to cause damage , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bord@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the indictment comes out only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential can@@ did@@ acy , when he said a crowd in North Carolina , that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment &quot; People &quot; - Sch@@ uss@@ w@@ affen@@ winkel and ceas@@ e@@ tiqu@@ ette - should take measures if his Ri@@ val@@ in Hill@@ ary Clinton should be elected and judge should appoint .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ is complaint requires claims for damages arising from the campaign to violation of the given duty of duty and of Philip because of the injury and fate of spiritual damage . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before European elections : SPD and CD@@ U loose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , significant losses for the government parties and CD@@ U are drawing .
this held representative surveys of the research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; image &quot; -@@ newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government co@@ ders could continue in the north almost further , this is not possible after the survey results in Berlin .
in both federal states the SPD would be the strongest party , and therefore would have good opportunities to keep the ruling class .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD rus@@ hed from 3@@ 5,@@ 6 percent to 24 percent in five years ago .
the party so that loud survey was only just under the CD@@ U , which could come again to 23 percent again .
the third place is controversial between the left and the Af@@ D controversial .
the Left Opposition to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country .
the Gre@@ ens are hes@@ it@@ ant despite slight losses with 6 percent ( previously 8,@@ 7 percent ) again in the Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented by 3 percent each per day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the Berlin dep@@ u@@ ties of the survey , the SPD won the survey only on 23 percent ( election 2011 : 2@@ 8,@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U only reached 18 percent to 23.@@ 4 percent .
they are still looking behind the green with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( before 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in our dep@@ u@@ ties .
with 5 percent the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pirates would not miss the one in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first Smartphone
e @-@ mail and internet in Tim@@ lu@@ pe : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market .
the success@@ ors today dominate the world - his producer lived a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed nearly half kilo@@ gram and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5 .
it was thicker and larger , therefore it was not good at hand .
on the contrary , it was rather kno@@ cked .
the built @-@ in memory was initially eight Meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would range today for about two sel@@ enium with high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ yte .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 in the shops - and it was the first Smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros , lovers can still buy the devices on the internet , but they originate somehow out of the stone &apos;s time of the dormitory .
but 20 years ago the Communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months before at CeBIT in Hannover as &quot; office in the West @-@ format format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent for then standards a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax was the communic@@ ator .
even access to web pages was possible by HTML browsers , although qu@@ el@@ ingly slowly .
a paper@@ back was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be similar to a laptop as a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
quite proud was the price : 2@@ 700 D @-@ Mark , so about 1400 Euros .
the average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was at 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
nobody was able to imagine in August 1996 that the Communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
clever teleph@@ ones are a success story , if not for Nokia .
the cell @-@ saving of fin@@ s lived an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold and handled in Microsoft .
the market dominate the market today , which came every much later than Nokia .
ever and everywhere online , this is today for very many people everyday life .
in 2015 there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
approximately 1,4 billion devices have been sold , on Samsung and Apple , of which alone 5@@ 55 million units are sold .
the global sales of the equipment is approximately 400 billion euros .
these are the well running shops of the countless App @-@ providers and telecommunications networks .
in the meantime , around the smartphone a whole industry has emerged .
the decisive breakthrough to the mass market was only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time , Apple &apos;s CEO Steve Jobs announced on the Mac World &apos;s introduction to the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and a Internet @-@ communic@@ ator , easy to use by touch screen .
the ascent of Apple started , still today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market had the watch .
you disappeared finally , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
on the cut , each German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to learn all to put the smartphone again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ms Jan@@ ina Ball , in the Siemens @-@ Management Board for Staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persistent degra@@ d@@ ability is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must draw the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw is not only used in our local municipalities and throughout London but throughout the country of renewal and prosperity .
for me , it was the largest attraction of He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , just as it was at the time in 2012 in London when we run a great deal of effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benef@@ itted from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and this will reach again by creating new possibilities for or@@ ts@@ ans@@ ing , and companies active near He@@ a@@ throw .
for our local communities we will already create 10,000 new appren@@ tices , 4@@ 0.000 new jobs and prepare the youth unemployment in the airport environment .
just as they were ahead in London 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of enlargement He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws is too great .
told me that England will never be ready for the games and that we will hide ourselves on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong with He@@ a@@ throw .
there are always obstacles to move , but He@@ a@@ throw answers any questions asked .
like the Olympic Games He@@ a@@ throw is for many and not for individual a fac@@ et project .
enlargement is a way to create up to 18@@ 0.000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in wit@@ ten@@ ant growth and leave a legacy of skills and jobs to leave the airport as well as in the whole of the UK .
we have put a great team in He@@ a@@ throw , which has put a £ 11 billion euros of infra@@ structural investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - the five years in succession to the world &apos;s best airport terminal was built up to T@@ 2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequencies of running the world .
now they are ready for a third run to deliver what is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment .
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for the UK and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ a@@ throw will also be one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to direct this olymp@@ ic mind and create He@@ a@@ throw as well as creating our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs to be proud of the England . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding advertising block &quot; &quot; &quot;
for companies that earn money with online @-@ hand money , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to handle scor@@ eboard , a &quot; K@@ atz@@ - and mouse game &quot; equal .
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ads on his desktop page , published Ad@@ block Plus a blo@@ g@@ post , in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday shared Facebook with that his desktop page would change the co@@ ding with regard to its promotions , in order to make it adver@@ ts the detection of what part of the site advertising is to be difficult to recognize .
but Ad@@ block proclaimed that it has found a new way to deal with new codes .
in a blo@@ g@@ post the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ H@@ er &apos;s fight was already underway since the invention of ad lock@@ ers in progress , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest company has left for social media in the battle is a strong indicator of how worrying advertis@@ ers became in the industry .
according to a study from the last year by Pa@@ ti@@ air and Adobe about 200 million people in the show lo@@ osen tensions ; almost four times as much 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily users active users who access Facebook about their mobile devices , Hand@@ y@@ wer@@ y 84 per cent of the advertis@@ ed fac@@ ebooks are taken .
the company has shown it on ad shut@@ ters on desktop PCs apart from mobile ad shut@@ ters no effect on fac@@ ebooks mobile app for the social network and inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a spokes@@ man .
advertisement on desktop PCs is making a sufficient size of revenue , so Facebook appears the investment of such a step as a worthwhile .
on Tuesday shared Facebook with that there would be &quot; advertis@@ ment &quot; pool &quot; to update the people more control over it un@@ zi@@ pped advertising .
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ bloc new filters were worrying , because they would also block content on the side that no advertising are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users this represents no positive experience , therefore we plan to address the problem , shared a spokes@@ person of Facebook in an email communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad @-@ blocking are a bl@@ unt means , which is why we have concentrated on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control over the hands of the people .
woman in suspected su@@ icide on the Swiss motorway
the victim lay at the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls witnesses to witness a woman in the early morning on Thursday at an suspected su@@ icide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d , shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman laid down in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of despair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the streets and were taken by several cars , the police said in the Vau@@ d canton . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss population at the age of 49 came from several vehicles , including a truck , over@@ ride , even wanted to kill .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some are still not identified , the police said these as well as every witness of the incident required to report himself .
it was opened an investigation process , which is a &quot; log@@ istical &quot; step in such a situation , shared Gill@@ es Hof@@ st@@ etter des Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gene@@ ve .
but it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a cl@@ ash avoidable ?
this is something what the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter .
two similar cases in the last five years show that the driver will not be held accountable .
in each of the two cases - when a person ran in the dark on the highway - was decided that the drivers don &apos;t have to assume that a ped@@ estri@@ ans may not walk in the middle of the night on the highway as it was in the newspaper .
last year a polic@@ eman of the neg@@ ligent kill@@ ings was acqu@@ itted after they had a man over@@ ride and killed , which was in August 2014 of a night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year victims had drunk and became unconscious on the road and took judgment .
the court resolved that the police -- who had responded to an emergency call -- on a justified way and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; totally exceptional and un@@ predictable situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has more information on the incident on Thursday near Morges , should register at the police number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 44 .
NASA Kli@@ m@@ amo@@ del : Venus was once li@@ vable
Venus was probably once inhabit@@ able according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA Kli@@ m@@ amo@@ d@@ ells .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate research .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water @-@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once have been rejected .
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation points out that Venus could have had a thin , d@@ ant @-@ like atmosphere and nevertheless slowly asc@@ ended .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably pointed out more dry regions than the earth , but had once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to stay alive and on faster trans@@ cription .
the early Venus benef@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent Mat@@ ter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the Venus revol@@ ves the slow rotation of Venus their daily side of the Sun almost two months , &quot; stated G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .

Patrick Roy comes back as a trainer of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and introduced a very low interest rate for the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and cons@@ ulted that the association will immediately look for a new coach .
&quot; in the last three years I have met my duties as a boss and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; expressed the 50 @-@ year Roy in an opinion .
in the course of the summer , I have been thinking about how I could improve this team to give it more depth to give it more depth , this it requires and to bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations perfectly match the organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also has to have a co @-@ determination in decisions that influence the performance of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are currently not fulfilled .
Sak@@ ic , which Roy announced on 23 May 2013 , than@@ ked him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick has informed me about this decision today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate what he has done for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Roy was awarded the winner of the Jack Adams Awards during his debut season as the Best Trainer of the League .
he led the association to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was be@@ aten in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota and missed in each of the last two years the post@@ season .
the description listed in season 2015 @-@ 16 a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand and fell behind the Wild for a second wild card Spot in the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart gained Roy four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ öl@@ ler again take talks on , put strike
the labour struggles for the re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation of the North Sea , are exposed , while all issues were put to the table for a new conversation at the table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field service providers Wood Group have been spor@@ adi@@ cally run on platforms in the North Sea that are operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood Group as well as the un@@ ites and the trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the ent@@ ang@@ ing process of current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will keep some full @-@ day meetings within the next weeks , the beginning of next year will start to tackle the problems .
the trade unions said that their last strike , who is the first in over 25 years , a protest against possible wage cuts by up to 30 percent be .
wood Group has abbrevi@@ ated the rates to its contrasts in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the rating of the company follows a 10 @-@ percentage decline for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts in the company has the required space to get through the market down@@ turn .
Shell has released for its part thousands of people and announced plans to give up his oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries since it ration@@ alize its business activities as a result of its me@@ at@@ re@@ union with the British energy companies BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure , due to lower cru@@ de prices , under pressure , an economic situation affecting the European Union by the decision of the British in June .
the Scottish Dave Anderson arrived at the beginning of this week with workers leaders to discuss one of the greatest working issues that took place since a generation in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected to invest in new projects in the North Sea in comparison to some $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures red @-@ rate of stars in the ast@@ er@@ als of the Ple@@ j@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Wel@@ fare tel@@ esc@@ ope has helped astronom@@ ers help the full catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the star of the Ple@@ j@@ aden .
the new data will help the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars in the star cluster are different to different rates , as well as in what connection the rot@@ ational @-@ periods with the planetary genesis .
&quot; we hope that we experience more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the constellation of the Ple@@ j@@ ades is located 4@@ 45 light@@ years from the earth .
many stars in this star cluster that emerged above 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood .
you are now turning at the fastest .
at peak rot@@ ational rates , these str@@ apping stars encounter great amounts of ast@@ er@@ winds .
since this winds is travelling through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars .
if a star is alter@@ t , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each of the star by recognis@@ es the time between the appearance of a recognizable star @-@ fle@@ cks -- like sun@@ spots --
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates points out that massive star slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars slower Pi@@ rou@@ gh@@ s as smaller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ballet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Ple@@ j@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors will tend to be massive , whereas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faster rot@@ ors &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the clu@@ sters of the Ple@@ j@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities like rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the constellation of the Ple@@ j@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is still much in front of us what we like to know more about how , W@@ ann and why stars slow@@ down their rotation rates and say their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dance shoes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported detailed information on their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Ple@@ j@@ aden , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball @-@ star starts
the tears ran at Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the US Bas@@ eball Star in the best days of Base to Base .
after his emotional return announcement , the 41 year old pro on 12 August against the Tamp@@ a Bay R@@ ays took a last time the jer@@ sey to its New York Yan@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Goo@@ db@@ ye &apos; to join the &apos; , the 14 @-@ time @-@ star @-@ game participants of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ guez was elected to the most valuable player of the League , 2009 he won with the Yan@@ ke@@ es World Series .
his signature under a ten @-@ year agreement had been paid for 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
until the end of the ascent on 31 December 2017 , he will be able to act as consultants and youth coach - at full sal@@ ary .
as a player , it paid to Rodri@@ guez for a long time .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for its teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he made some mil@@ estones in 2005 .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays point only two other bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics similar values .
but in the silence of the bas@@ eball , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is likely to be recorded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because so successful Rodri@@ guez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - in the field was so controversial is his appearance outside the square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 the super@@ star called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 were taken to have taken . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 he was closed due to a slow@@ ing in the so @-@ called Bio@@ graphy sc@@ andal up to the end of 2014 for 211 games .
Rodri@@ guez is regarded as the main susp@@ icious , for years to have received an anti @-@ aging clinic in Southern Florida .
after a dispute the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done for 2014 for 2014 , because I have spent 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez back then . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even his f@@ arewell days did not go wrong .
while many bas@@ eball legends in their last games have once again received the big stage , Rodri@@ guez had to sit out often on the bank .
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves the attempt to win every game , &quot; Extra Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .
after all Rodri@@ guez , who was married with the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and the conditions with Pop@@ star Madonna and the act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , sympathy of fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e Arch@@ riv@@ alen Boston Red So@@ x .

Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Tar@@ inski are the first d@@ op@@ ing@@ es
caught : because of a positive D@@ op@@ ing@@ test may not start wei@@ ght@@ the@@ ber Adrian Tar@@ inski from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official D@@ op@@ ing@@ es .
a caught ath@@ lete would have been almost a medal .
before the seventh race , the first official d@@ op@@ ing@@ es of the Olympic Games have become known in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese swi@@ mmer in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacles in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ch@@ the@@ ber Adrian Tar@@ inski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the already critical athle@@ tics cont@@ ests these messages come to un@@ time .
at Ch@@ en last Sunday , the Di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de has already been detected , which is used as a mas@@ king means for dop@@ amine sub@@ types .
the International Sport@@ stra@@ shof CA@@ S confirmed on Friday afternoon local time to the exclusion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had the fourth place in the final over 100 m butter@@ fly occupied , just around 0.@@ 09 seconds missed the bronze .
on Friday Ch@@ en would have to take part in the footh@@ ills over 50 m of Fre@@ est@@ l .
Ch@@ en has requested the opening of the B @-@ sample at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and requested a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association take the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and demands from Ch@@ en &apos;s full cooperation among the studies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; zi@@ pped X@@ in@@ hua from a communication : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport@@ s@@ shof CA@@ S and will accept the verdi@@ ct . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history , it is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S responsible for the refur@@ bish@@ ment of athletes with positive cases .
also at night out of Rio oo@@ zes the news about the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ ova through , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is inno@@ cent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; stated the athle@@ tics team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is intended to act with the botan@@ ic substance to act the EP@@ O &apos;s blood @-@ offering .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova was provisional , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should have already been positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w was immediately addressed with criticism of the Ath@@ eni@@ ans word .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the ath@@ lete does not draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians stand under observation , so many are already excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , about all the weights of the chron@@ ically @-@ wearing nation can not take part in Rio .
on Friday also the case &quot; Adrian Tar@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London olymp@@ ic winner in class up to 85 kg was tested as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z for three days previously positive on the an@@ abo@@ le Ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon .
both are riding the ing@@ esting , but they are not allowed to start in class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athle@@ tics l@@ itter is especially the case Dan@@ ek@@ ova is another difficult blow for the reputation of the entire sport .
the IA@@ AF World Association IA@@ AF had banned the entire Russian team up to an exception because of systematic D@@ op@@ ings to the start , also the purification of Kenya produced in Rio numerous bad news .
in the swimming pool , the earlier Ver@@ sions in China had also taken care of severe conflicts between athletes .
thus the French@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t took place the Chinese Olympic and Sun Yang .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ est@@ l , I want to pass , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun also stood at the center of a confrontation with the Austr@@ ali@@ er M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for mental sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was positive in 2014 at the Chinese champion@@ ships , had a positive effect on the stimulation of the Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit only a three @-@ month lock .
data @-@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ presses h@@ ackers their ran@@ som
programmers of Er@@ compres@@ sing mal@@ ware currently hold company targeted companies - and are successful in this process .
according to a recent survey of the mal@@ ware defense experts Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes under 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surv@@ eyed companies have been at least once , partly several victims of an attack with decre@@ es software .
in Germany , nearly 20 percent of firms were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware yield .
40 percent of the victims paid by the offen@@ ders demanded by the perpetrators , in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpetrators speci@@ alize their yield software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes to attack attacks in corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially waste ran@@ som ran@@ som is significantly higher than for private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re currently watching a terri@@ fying fast evolution of the damage software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes manager Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising .
then we discovered the perpetr@@ ator software for itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only private users were the goal , but the change to company attacks took place quickly during the past few months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the computer of a sacrifice , it looks targeted after un@@ long modified files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ esti@@ al or database files , as well as to archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als .
then the software presents the demands of the creation .
to get the final deco@@ ding code into the files , the victims need to transfer money - usually in the form of cryp@@ to@@ nutrition Bit@@ coin .
but where private users use the personal photo database on the game , it is about sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production is shut down .
accordingly higher the damage is made when a ran@@ som@@ ware strikes .
22 percent of the German companies affected by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent even had to break the activity completely , in case of a case people were in life .
in Germany , several hospitals have been victims of attacks , whose patients may be threatened by the loss of nur@@ ses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are saying the victims always : pays not , you only promotes the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , get their data again .
for managers it is difficult , considering the claim to reject the perpetrators of the perpetrators .
the h@@ acker again know this and try to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ secure the utility surfaces and the contact with the makers are examined and come to the result : the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they declare their sacrifices by chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , direct accessible support websites , or de@@ cryp@@ t for free example files .
and they will redeem a few hundred euros after payments by a few hundred Euros , companies have to pay partly tough and five @-@ digit sums in order to reg@@ ain their data encrypted .
given the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware reduction , the h@@ acker is always professional and share the work , explains safety sex@@ per@@ te Chester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski of anti @-@ virus provider Sop@@ hos : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware of about within a week . &quot;
more likely it is that it is three or four people .
the programmers sell their damage software then in the form of a software building on the actual yields .
the previous mal@@ ware kit arose by the Mal@@ ware itself , consulting and additional tools purchased for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; included is an adaptation tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the results are then looking for further h@@ ackers to spread the newly bought software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
so you logs in one of the forums on the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a crimin@@ als and have another way to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
the payment is made per set @-@ up calculator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually , the crimin@@ als then bear sp@@ ammer with the spread &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies who want to better secure their data .
more than 50 percent of companies responsible in the mal@@ war@@ ring survey will rely on the rank of Ran@@ som@@ ware using file @-@ back @-@ ups and Sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
accordingly , the perpetrators already pursue new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data is not sufficient threat to successful recognition , the perpetrators deal instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer list or pricing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes head Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the potential for damage , depending on the type of data still much higher than before .
in the future , the perpetrators will also be able to take completely new goals on the internet of things .
on the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con demonstrated security researchers , as they could get a thermo@@ stat thermo@@ stat under their control .
in the middle of winter the activation of such a so blocked heating as such a ran@@ som could be quite a ran@@ som .
if the perpetr@@ ator then instead of the heating in the future block an entire production line in a factory , ran@@ som@@ ware could also become an issue in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday
in the small HR @-@ V Honda I want to pack everything : a little S@@ UV , a little cou@@ pe and also the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans .
sounds pretty over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was built on the same new platform as the new Jazz , proves to be quite flexible in everyday life .
although the HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the F@@ ond . there is no place in any place .
the materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasant , only the cock@@ pit @-@ upper side falls off there .
versatile as comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in storage box .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only a caffeine room of 4@@ 53 l at high @-@ rated and 10@@ 26 l in the back @-@ out spinal column , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the back@@ bank can be uploaded like Kin@@ os@@ es@@ sel and offer storage space , which is high from the floor up to blankets 1,@@ 24 m high .
the caffeine room is well loaded , however , the load height with 650 mm is slightly higher than at the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1,6 @-@ l @-@ diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide range of ranges .
but he might judge his work somewhat le@@ iser .
gr@@ ati@@ fying is the everyday abuse of 4,@@ 7 l / 100 km .
there is still another engine ori@@ zation : a 1.5 @-@ l gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a hand@@ wheel drive is not offered .
the chassis is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering is likely to be a bit more direct .
the equipment leaves no wishes un@@ tested in the tested top variant &quot; Executive &quot; .
to the safety systems , the City @-@ Not@@ brake assist@@ ent ( works up to speed 32 ) , the col@@ l@@ isions @-@ system and the spine super@@ visor .
the col@@ l@@ isions were irrit@@ ated sometimes because it has been rated many obstacles as the &quot; descending objects . &quot;
very reliable works the remote super@@ visor .
and the intelligent twist react to the road detection and th@@ rot@@ tle when required the speed .
the full connectivity of connectivity is available only for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and More .
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI @-@ jack are under the arm@@ rest and therefore are a bit aw@@ k@@ ward to achieve .
the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top @-@ diesel are fine .
those who do not want to invest so much will receive Ben@@ zin@@ er from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel starting from 2@@ 3000 Euro .
the motors meet the Euro @-@ 6 exhau@@ st standard .
with the HR @-@ V Honda offers a versatile and versatile car .
Airline is not liable : fall on passenger bridge
an Airline is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
for a liability is conceivable only with haz@@ ards that are typical of the air traffic , argued the Supreme Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken down with the down@@ fall a knee divor@@ ce .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it is a general risk of life , so the court .
the airline had to pay no harm to the man .
disease case : when paid the operator
dise@@ ased vac@@ ation@@ ers after their journey only get money back when the cause of the disease is dou@@ bt@@ ful in the hotel .
however , this is only the case if more than ten percent of guests have proven the same symptoms .
in the negotiated case , a family was heavily damaged on the second day of its tur@@ quoise and break down .
she spent almost the whole holiday in the room .
her illness led the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a def@@ ective lament that alle@@ ge@@ dly poll@@ uted the se@@ a@@ water .
the family was the view , the journey would have been faul@@ ty - and def@@ endant against the organizer .
in court , the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success .
although the frac@@ ture was in fact faul@@ ty .
but the organis@@ er only drove just before leaving the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff of it .
he had to go out to that the sea water was fine .
he did not violate his information duties , so judgment .
especially since in the rehear@@ sals of the water no contamination were found .
the disease of several hotel guests - bl@@ ur@@ ely by infection among each other - belonging to the general lifestyle .
of 6@@ 91 guests were only 38 erk@@ ran@@ ged .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said following the violence used by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people have had a lot of people from other attacks .
the state must be circumc@@ ised and determined to respond to terrorist attacks .
sure : our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and spl@@ itting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this triumph we will not give terrorists terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if offen@@ ders need to leave the country faster , they increase the security and cost of the population for the refugee policy .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère aims to achieve a implementation of the proposals up to the German Parliament elections .
he also announced another personal strengthening of security forces , namely &quot; in medium @-@ scale size over several years . &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must be back under penalty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; video surveillance should be improved , the ceas@@ e@@ fire must be as opposed to all the purchase of weapons in the internet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last much discussed swe@@ at for doctors is to be preserved to de Mai@@ zi@@ ères words .
however , in dialogue with the doctor he wants to look for solutions , such as the threat of citizens , he said with a view to psych@@ ic points .
in order to counter@@ act the radi@@ cal@@ isation of refugees , the Minister holds a better social support for necessary .
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with traum@@ atis@@ ed people .
in the persecution of crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dar@@ k@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning to be used .
SPD &apos;s boss Gabriel said : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to increasing security . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the inner Minister said clearly against action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a ear@@ ching for the hinges on the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel said the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected Ru@@ fe from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of double nation@@ alism before .
a general ban on the enforcement of the enforcement er will be problematic for constitu@@ tionally .
you can not offer everything you re@@ jects , and I Leh@@ ne the wearing of Bur@@ ka .

better transport on the motorway exit
it is regularly on the direction of the road - here is a picture of November .
but this should change : the law shall be extended .
this is good news for all car drivers , who are at the professional traffic on the ambient street every night in St@@ au if they drive over the highway from Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the state farm is extended next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the hammer street and the descent of Wes@@ eler Road to the right of 700 meters .
drivers can then insert directly from the hammer street on the right .
the big advantage : the traffic shares early on , thus increasing the overall process on the multiple section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of Distribution Münster @-@ West .
the driver &apos;s driving on the br@@ ink is more nervous the mot@@ orists above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days the back@@ bone is sufficient to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ ping way and sometimes beyond .
this is why the needle is located at the B 51 shortly before the departure of Wes@@ eler Road .
from here the traffic is only pointed to the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built in front of a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations had to indicate that the bridge does not have the required load @-@ carrying capacity , in order to accommodate above all the heavy traffic .
how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the connected ste@@ alth will last , the responsible state can not say .
however , it is expected to count for years : for the bridge has an official rest duration until the year 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the rule of law , the provincial operation was fully aware of the bu@@ si@@ est time in the school holidays , because with disabilities to be reck@@ oned .
the traffic will be passed on Tuesday and on Wednesday at the job@@ site .

rain instead of star@@ ving : hope on weather repair

relaxing night : tips against sleeping disorders
in the evening you have been etern@@ ally lying around , at night it is so@@ ak @-@ long , in the morning there is already far in front of the w@@ aking cl@@ ing@@ les not to think of sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is in good company with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep , and over ten per cent have often feel their sleep often or permanently relaxing .
how do sleep problems or sleep @-@ disorders differ ?
there are several forms of sleeping disorders , and there are many causes underlying them , empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eper , Board member of the German Society for Sle@@ eping and Sle@@ medizin .
what one inevitably understands it , but is the In@@ som@@ never , so one inhal@@ ation and sle@@ ep@@ y .
especially the sleep many people feel as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , Board member of the German household association with practice in low @-@ Sax@@ on Var@@ el .
what lies behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind it can be organic , mental or solid @-@ related factors , but also medications are stuck .
it is not rare the sle@@ eves expression of another disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is often common with depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it may be that different factors be@@ ating one another .
those who for example has a band separ@@ ator can lie badly , wake up all two to three hours and then bl@@ ur@@ ry to greet you about everyday problems and worry , gives We@@ ar one example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should one be with sleep @-@ disorders about the doctor ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and is com@@ promised in the day , should go to the doctor \ t We@@ j@@ ora .
the impair@@ ment may vary quite differently : one is down@@ cast , tired , un@@ covered , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily able , has voting fluctu@@ ations or bodily ail@@ ments like gast@@ ric or head@@ ache .
in order to alle@@ vi@@ ate the sleeping @-@ compul@@ sion , it is important to find their causes .
as a treatment options , a cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or even medicines - classic bedrooms occur only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quired .
Dutch dormit@@ ories exist in Germany hardly , emphasises Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the interdisciplinary dormitory of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
therefore , in case of sleep problems , one should contact the doctor &apos;s primary care first .
the problems can clear whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go into the dormitory , and what happens there ?
to study in the sleeping laboratory medicine , for example in snor@@ ing with respir@@ ation , in case of disease @-@ fatigue , with sle@@ eves or if you can not find the cause of a sle@@ ep@@ tive disorder , explains Fi@@ etze .
in the investigation you do not have to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just do not make mid@@ day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after bon@@ ding one goes to his normal time into the bed .
beside the electrodes on the body one carries a mu@@ g@@ gles , a chest strap and a fi@@ ddle at the finger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , a camera is characterized by the ceiling to sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can the problems be able to handle the problems ?
there are quite a lot of actu@@ ators where you can use for a better sleep .
We@@ ar counts on : regular sleeping @-@ up times , not too long in bed , on the day not sleep , do not watch TV to sleep , alcohol , and don &apos;t look at night - then one starts to reck@@ on immediately , and that is completely and not condu@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has expressed himself by Facebook to dis@@ appoint the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he was taken at the shor@@ tw@@ ave championship in Doha at the first time in Doha and presented his first puppy record at the same time .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler available via fac@@ ebook will be put on Facebook in front of his critic@@ isms .
&quot; in a country where a olymp@@ ic winner receives 20,000 € award and a jun@@ k of 15@@ 0.000 € should not be surprised about missing medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old in the night to Friday on his Facebook page .
the feed system in swimming sport is bad , the D@@ op@@ ing@@ controls however very good .
in this way , we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not understand the subject matter or even operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said he further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he would start to launch a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler should already be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ Doping Agency Deutschland ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how one should keep it with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who cannot be controlled a certain period before World Championship / OS of independent Contro@@ ll@@ ers of W@@ ada / F@@ ina &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; must not take part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hamburger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which now operates an ice cream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de from Bag@@ di@@ eben arrested
professional Di@@ ebe at Düsseldorf Airport
civil gli@@ ders of the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police succeeded on Thursday the arrest of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years .
the Tat@@ ver@@ susp@@ ects had committed to as Ban@@ de several hand@@ ker@@ - and luggage lock@@ ers .
against 21.@@ 30 , civil servants recognized in the area of the airport Düsseldorf a gang again , which was known to the police officers from past theft .
the two women and two men had several off@@ ences committed since the middle of July this year and were particularly appreciated , working out and particularly professional .
the specialists of the crimin@@ al@@ com@@ mander 34 can have traveled the thi@@ eves , which had been a peculi@@ ar of criminal off@@ ences to Germany , four acts .
they had a total of more than 15@@ ,000 Euros .
Alt@@ erected , a few lin@@ o@@ aks , inter alia still a rest cob@@ bled Stre@@ ets : the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Fried@@ ri@@ chs@@ ha@@ in affects the first look not so , but the police count her to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
one walks along the road from east to west , one comes to playground , a fresh@@ ed nursery and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
to the façade of a gray house is someone &quot; ugly ! &quot; checked .
opposite of a li@@ d@@ l , which should also be demol@@ ished soon , is already built : until 2017 , here is a house with high windows and 133 new flats .
article about this &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; as the competent property owner called Fried@@ ri@@ chs@@ ha@@ in , are preferred in recent weeks however preferably with burning cars .
the ground is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rented apartments , on the ground floor are still spaces occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , the Berlin inter@@ sen@@ ator H@@ igh@@ s had been committed to a tough action of the police against the project , the area called &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence .
after June 22nd , the rooms were cleared on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers , the police took three weeks long official statements , with 30 to 40 officials and three teams on the spot , sper@@ sed parts of the road and kept visitors from the house to enter the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , renovated building workers on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin Board of Directors decided that the clearance had been illegal , and a day later went police and builders under the jubil@@ ation of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the street is peaceful : parents go walking with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tained himself sp@@ ät@@ i .
in the immediate vicinity of the house @-@ projects there are a primary school and kinder@@ gartens .
left violence is not the principal of many inhabitants : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives since 1999 in the Kie@@ z , and Jan@@ a * , which attracts three children , are mostly dominated by the police presence of gener@@ v@@ t .
with the inhabitants of the household projects , they split the concern in front of rising mi@@ xes and cent@@ er@@ tification .
it does not sound like a j@@ uni@@ z who wish to make several ser@@ f@@ ici@@ ally pol@@ ishing protection against v@@ and@@ ali@@ ent left .
the dit@@ ch , den of the Berlin internal sen@@ ator and the police between households and their neighbours , does not exist .
Fried@@ ri@@ chs@@ ha@@ in in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; district , which today reached a lower and high poverty risk today compared to the rest of the city .
also house occup@@ ations and the resulting residential projects belong long to the Kie@@ z : in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost all the Main@@ zer street very close to the Riga .
while the Main@@ zer was evacu@@ ated under a large police battle in a regular street laugh@@ ing , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the rig and are still occupied by the people who occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the part of the district in recent years has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and elec@@ tors from all over the world : with them , the inhabitants of the GDR and former household members are now settled in their p@@ ines .
this also noticeable in the mist@@ aken , which has increased by nearly 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the rig are attacked as symbols for this development : one recognis@@ es them in the wor@@ shi@@ ped discs or freshly pro@@ ver@@ ted fac@@ ades , which were rejected by shade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year together with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lin@@ ks@@ aut@@ on@@ ous violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason why not all neighbours consider that as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : criminal off@@ ences such as body breach is subject to statistics almost exclusively against police officers .
the most part of the criminal off@@ ences make damage , the bi@@ ased rather the new buildings and newly renovated houses meet .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94 , can be no talk of in@@ security .
as far as violence is concerned , it is sh@@ ame@@ ful : people in the 94 are their neighbours that would not have been determined this .
also the famous burning cars will not give it directly in the rig for longer .
for the studied architect , her street is not a crime focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the road and gets more than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer was deliberately pulled into the rig street - and stayed .
for this reason , it was also so important that the residents get back their street : from the police , politics and the media , all of which suddenly claimed the interpretation of the neighborhood in July .
but in the eyes of the inhabitants such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away : through sigh@@ tly re@@ constructions in former building gaps , which impose the old residents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are ultimately property apartments which are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so good &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction I can absolutely not see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should you do when one never list@@ ens to someone ?
there are frustration on all sides , even at the police and the residents .
for Zu@@ ge@@ zo@@ genic , who anno@@ yed on colour bom@@ bs , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
whoever moves , should be aware - just like someone who runs into a pub that can complain about noise there .
all persons mentioned only with names of names have asked to be called by their right name
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugee officer
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organizer .
and she is a social worker on the spot .
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le the refugee officer for Ur@@ bach .
the social pedago@@ gin supports the team of management by Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees himself as a contact person for all actors : refugees , working and refugee assistance , administration , authorities and who else mis@@ chi@@ ves .
Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer of the working circle indicates that the volunteer is more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le now is there , the experience of wool , which is above all a problem .
so some - less sp@@ icious as rather on the multitude of desire @-@ looking @-@ pur@@ pos@@ e@@ ful - meant when the administration wanted to write the site .
looking for a administration of management with a talent for languages and people , coupled with many years of experience in the field of social work , just an ag@@ gregate wool .
but administrative work is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
most of all , I go to organization , work with local people and also behind the scenes , as well as network service .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been here for about six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent priority for three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le ehr@@ - and full @-@ time actors support .
there are big and minor problems , organisational , human and understanding problems .
soon there are new containers in the Was@@ her Road
a heavy problem has been a serious problem for some time , apartments for the refugees who have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for connecting .
you have to place the refugees in your own or rented apartment .
the costs of the construction , the rent or the refur@@ bish@@ ment of these accommodations must carry the municipalities itself .
the responsibility changes from the coun@@ ties to the commune and the job centre .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been a very difficult time for some time .
de facto the administration does not find private apartments .
there are so far not to be reli@@ ed on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , the most common apartments must be cured , as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers are placed in the washing @-@ way .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine Customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
apart from a firm lead , it is practic@@ rates , training centers , one @-@ euro jobs and helpl@@ ess activities for refugees and migrants that have been frozen or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reported Reg@@ ine Customer .
many work in the building yard or help school@@ master , do @-@ profit work - and this motiv@@ ates and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
it hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive impact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but does not mean work only . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the day need a fixed structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
the people would have to develop a sense of being .
so there are offers such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are ra@@ r .
so you also jump here administration and volunte@@ ering .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling , they are welcome in Germany and welcome .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must declare the refugees that it takes and they can make sense of sense , for example with language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who eventually develop the feeling that could not help in Ur@@ bach , do not work and be useless , which will never be integrated .
the clear majority is motivated .
problem cases , but also , says customer honestly , &quot; people , where nothing is going on . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and client is therefore always something to motiv@@ ate others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ amm@@ ability task &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : do the two after the recent occurrence of radi@@ cal@@ isation , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what might be na@@ ï@@ ve na@@ ï@@ ve &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; a resi@@ dual risk could not and if it does not want to exclude it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sensi@@ ti@@ zes the hel@@ pers but already .
these inci@@ dents are also subject to the refugees .
they would have been afraid that attacks bring them completely into distor@@ tion .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer .
many would love to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so you need to keep track of major and honorary position on the spot and in the region according to activities .
they always have in the background that soon a new shock could come to refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a limit ?
this question is clear to answer , shy the politics .
actually it is unfair to place them hero@@ ines on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we are not yet arrived , where we would like , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees that would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer also makes clear that Ur@@ bacher are already familiar with it to be reasonable to the previous person .
these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men .
but when people are in need , one must help them both women agree .
the political world situation is as complicated as there are no simple answers .
