<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade deal - they want both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential riers are on the control and energy policy as well as in a fundamental demand.</seg>

<seg id="7">Clinton wants to raise the economy to death and regulate death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself on the other hand would be quite different, claiming trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will massively withdraw regulations, and he makes for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates strong - for private people and for companies.</seg>

<seg id="11">That is why the taxes for the rich, says it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In which one must be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost eloquently.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate at all announces the greatest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical Teingy wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "thus, on Trump, there could be no party discussions yet." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">Significant are the differences in energy and climate policy.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal power plants and rebuild the coal funding in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in far-protected areas, the Paris climate agreement wants to cancel it.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton on the other hand wants to extend and calls for renewable energies with its investment program: "a country will create the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpotional trade deal, both do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "at the same time both the US want to isolate the US not from international trade, but simply protect American jobs better." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">The situation should then be paid even better, calls for example Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7,25 US dollars is a hunger wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">She wants to increase it on 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be down, then he says he should not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "on the one hand is trump who wants to reduce the economy and citizens to boost growth." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "Russia and Turkey: an" "" "Alliance of Foreign Affairs" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give the hands and preach an official end to the eight months of long-term war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish counterplayer in the gold-plated hall of St. Petersburg Palace in the reception, I cannot forbid myself to the expression that Ankara wants to make this reconciliation most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smiles were dingy and he pointed out hardly heat even for its backward circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan, however, spoke of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report whole five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to its old level before the crisis, but can even better be improved.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day a newspaper described that Erdogan would have heard so would never happen something worse.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm was rather the opposite to imply.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable coolers showed that the President of Russia had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first what he mentioned in his introductory remarks: the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border by Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's response to time was walled.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin informed and accused Ankara, Russia in his back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The verb was even bigger, since it was committed by a alleged friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Vetroen rebuild again becomes difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">Months long the state-controlled media led a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At once it seemed to be the Turks for all the guilt.</seg>
<seg id="21">At the most serious issue, the accusations of leading officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited by the illegal oil trading in areas of Syria, which are controlled by the so-called Islamism state.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse that he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara the benefits of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is primarily required to get all the friends he could get after last month with a feited coup above his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have made Turkey tough - in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is reduced by nearly 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia travel agents and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are taken back.</seg>
<seg id="33">You are counting on a late seasonal onslaught in the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the national watch has predicted fruit and vegetables, as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports will be allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vdemosti formulated it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry on the West as it looks to the tried of power as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "for this, the ongoing Groll comes across the snail of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pike to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian state of State won in Ankara with certainty a bonus that he asked for the coup d support for the elected state institutions.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "this is well-known for Moscow is a matter of course, that itself has changed a deeper fear of regiment." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit meeting in this splendid palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey, one, as it was an analysts once described, "Alliance of outsities": two countries which chased out from the West and were poorly treated.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still major differences between the two still.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support contradictory sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be indicative that after nearly three hours of initial discussions on the press conference, they said that they would not even have understood the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey was clearly evident on a question about their differences, while Putin decided to stress this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and considering the potential for a complete dispersion, as NATO member Turkey abomit the Russian martial arts - it is certainly better that the two heads of state should talk at least one another.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia Putin feudal staff, Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">The Russian president Vladimir Putin did not release his staff, Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanov was many years part of the closest trust of Putin.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed as a special officer for environmental and transportation.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an opinion of the Kremlin it is that Putin has arranged the dismissal of Ivanov by its duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who was deputy since 2012 Ivanov's deputies, was appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 1972 he was born in the Estonian capital, he made his conclusion at the renowned Moscow Department for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in Tokyo's embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin's website (in Russian) it was later called a director and leader of the government personnel.</seg>
<seg id="10">He said to Putin about his appointment, "thank you for your confidence."</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as heads of state and controls for the implementation of your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday with that Ivanov asked to leave his post and have recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the ridiculous faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the closest trusted Vladimir Putin's and works as he is for the Soviet intelligence, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As a leader, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on TV, both men claimed that the staff will withdraw his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smiles for the cameras, here are only few of them convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">Here is the consequence of a kind of power-fighting?</seg>
<seg id="20">This is currently no one.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who was once more prized as a potential president, who would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - came to great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks about Putin, who are cited on the website of Kremlin, Ivanov said it is true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - complaining about four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Minister of Defence and Defence Minister.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin's former member of the State Security Service (KGB).</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, as Putin Chairman of the Federal Security Treaty (FSB) was appointed to the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When he came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was believed that Ivanov could be President of Russia in the second term president of Russia as a third presidential coup against the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken from another, close ally, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion-expensive project should be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Economic Minister Keith Brown took a visit to the site today and was one of the first to go from the land to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "this is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensd Crossing." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an engineering experience of a truly epic extent in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel which were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the switch between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity which require extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">Overall, almost 79% of the total bridge can be found at their place and the last section of Decks today in Rosyth is a scongate for the deck, which means the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first closure is a significant milestone in each bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the trend-oriented high- and deep construction.</seg>
<seg id="15">After installing the last roadsection and its connection with the Nordturmdeck, we had to fill the still existing gap in the north or country side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by dragging the northern exposure bridge 700 millimetres south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive, since the viaduct is 222 meters long, ca. 6,000 tons weighs up and at an incline of approximately 3% had to be pulled upwards.</seg>

<seg id="9">However, the cheap apartments can also be found in the stock market.</seg>
<seg id="10">But the big issues in the town hall is, however, as Bratmann: "how do you want to build with investors to build on private areas?"</seg>

<seg id="17">The action concept is implemented, will ensure additional tasks in the building management.</seg>

<seg id="23">To prevent this, so the planatory consultation in Nicole Palm, should now be busted by the city.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenage boys and child to play no longer go outside, but rather prefer to spend their free time with it, on screens to rigid, has been laminated in the last decade of many.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go, it is about getting people from the sofa and become more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially based on TV, then on video games and last on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it is great to see that technology and activities do not exclude each other in the open air.</seg>
<seg id="7">I naturally refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters, who were first created for the video games in the 1990s (later created from it a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of Popcivilisation sunk in the interest before the release of the game in the US, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The launch in other countries has been postponed by massive demand that overloaded the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go more users had as Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players with their smartphones go outside and look for Pokémons that are tracked with a GPS once they were found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the Wahn and sprang up for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the United States the game led to a considerable increase in steps that puts the "average" person every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, distributed 35.000 users recently shared the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of traceable folks who exercise every day 30 minutes, from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays with Pokémon Go - it merely sees raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns to health that people want to bring" "" "30 minutes" "" "to come from the sofa" "" "to be active every day, because many public messages are boring to be boring and coming from people who look forward." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the meaning of sport can not be evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Who regularly drives sport, reduces its chances to prevent cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing at Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors, making them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people close to the hunt even new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there is also maturing game corrupted, who always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit earlier we were able to trace our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sport as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its charm and use it with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Due to Pokemon's success, however, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world and help with many people on hunting, active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That's what I present to me under the women's Olympic team and that is more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all, I have been in the summer olympic since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three gymnastics, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Hernandez, inspired for many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>

<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one was one among the female gymnast.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is showing strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising olympic lady and America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple World Championship in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez to be as they were unexpected, but masterful Gymastical routines supplied.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone the fourth, heterosexual American, who won an individual majesty event for women gold.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won Silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the tip of this sport, but so are the classes around the country not off.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie smote all the same way as Aly and Madison to create it into the Olympic Team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Learned Five" because the next Olympics are only four turers in the team. moreover, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks like that Turnen ein expensive sport is and Turner primarily associated with private turnaround which are maintained by parents who costs for training, furnishing, travel - and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families). the list can be continued as desired.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "the majority of these turnaround are in affluent suburbs that can support business." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">In these verses, the turers will receive their entire training and that is for the families a teures and long-term commitment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, Trainers of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, Trainers of Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes, since they started with the tower.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to be inspired to the municipalities aun countless, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, offering a performance and easier accessible gym.</seg>

<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you're approaching from the front or from behind, this video will show you how you turn around for your thief.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you are approaching from behind you, you should look at the top so that you can see your attacker and go out of the bottom line, "says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grab the weapon then between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit it with your free elbows to the face.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then hit him then with the knee into the body and twisted, while the attacker is merging against pain, the weapon from his hands. strike it with the run into the face and move backwards as they direct the weapon to it.</seg>
<seg id="8">At attackers, coming from the front, the technique is similar - move your body from the stock line, grab the weapon and spin it, so that the attacker cannot shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Transfer the weight to the gun at the same time and beat the attacker to the chest, then turn the gun off his grip before they move backwards and direct the weapon to it.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller underwent his immune system and worgereflex of a serious examination - by emdded some of the narrower and eclecturest places of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and travel self Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk recharte his time on a Euro shaft, a railed on Piccadilly Circus, a sink button on the Piccadilly Circus, a sink button and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of its immune system under evidence.</seg>
<seg id="4">In front of the leak of each object he used a Luminometer for himself and to show us what he will get involved.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment made under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Stallion" brought some surprising results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought that rinse the rinscription of a drawback, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be totally repulsive, but actually there are in a kitchen rinse more bad bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals on the promotion of intestinal bacteria, as well as his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left, what he spotted, more than a bad taste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Wright has been known to test the resistance of his intestine by journeyed through the world and ate peculiar and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds to railway stations to railway stations to sink of toilets, the task posed his immune system definitely among a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told: "already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was a reputation in any case.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused, was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its test sprawed showed a Luminometric number of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the Luminometric gains is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to cut off after their Luminometriers over 4000 units was, while freshly shaken hands one of less than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products valio produced the Reisefhiker's Guide to Inner Stulth, "which shows the bacterial number in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "this comes the worst thing that I gered in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="22">The company manages Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both military and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, juices and New categories Niko Vukovmaa says: "we wanted the consumers really something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>

<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of the intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with documentary film we could provide the consumer more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala who led the Director of the film, added: "let me tell me so - I would have lost my respect for Ian, when he wanted to instruct him, just like the ekelous Russian toilet that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course, there were things where it was easier to bring Ian to snails and others where this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I am glad that we have recorded some of this dirty goodies on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by 2015, 84 per cent of all surveyed lactic acid bacteria, especially with the well-being of stomach and intestine, and 58 percent said that they are using at least occasionally products that contain muted lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: who does not purchase records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle ages love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you go to the commentative parts, in order to reconsider it under the alias of non-escalation ages with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the present resurgence of sound panels is not attributable to a boom in millennials, which would like to welcome the novelties of physical objects, but to Midlife-nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently bought a record, are all forecast after the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact the age group of 18-24 is the most likely cant group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a horror by hobbyists - it has an emotional importance: older turntables retain their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on TV, I would follow the camera, while in the midst of a busy road in Soho, a modest grey pull and wild, before I steal, my hands keep and a bit identifiable as: "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Sohos is slowly entering its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent sellers were located - there are still a handful of fantastic record stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman, to turn the camera for the next part in which I stand within walking distance to various men in such shops and try to estimate their age and minds through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I was from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men middle ages) into Reccless Records (data number: eight men middle ages, a woman, presumably around the 20) is one day long because of a meeting in London and passes through the shops to fill a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already appreciate," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">This sound plates, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail; I did not follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such considerable numbers of albums and singles, is the result of its available income: it is now able to buy plates, which he could not afford as she appeared and sold again items that he sold, when he was young and pleite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things which I probably was too young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy plates, more introverted and happy to spend their own time, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink a lot.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, believes that many customers he meets on the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the Medienhpe, people who have heard about the comeback and let themselves look back to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations that I have led, people usually have been watching their collection in 1998 or in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, sell their CDs to get back their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to realize that record stores offers a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers attended the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record-fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw to the stability of confidential soundtrack, from objects, the lucky Jugenders.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes it can be the filling of a void or the possession of material possessions than a kind of comfort," says WZ.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is with me as a collector and I think it is so many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "flaming an employee of a record stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of the ICM in April reveal that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month they have not yet heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found out that 41% have a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who do a record, don't have a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of news report, I would probably look very worried while being bladed by a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works in sounds of the Universe (data number: three men middle ages) has noticed a "trophy" of Revivals.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone only recently came here and said," "" "I do not wish to buy a record player, but I would like to buy a radiohead record record, so that I can put them into the shelf," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a large percentage, but it is definitely going on.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musician.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say:" "" "I have no record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older, who will only slowly come out.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fp, which has dedicated the sound of the noise almost a whole floor, has a blower audience when I go.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around 70, tourists who make photos, teeny and women middle ages.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops is - Wild Beast Newthesizers and far-packed pop instead of experimental jazz reconciled from the loudspeakers - it's good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them sees sonic lonely, but wet psychic traumata are difficult to determine if one stands next to someone 30 seconds long.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, runs in business for several minutes and considers the variability of the plates available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is more of a showcase of a showcase as a big one.</seg>
<seg id="50">It does not deserve much, therefore the collecting of plates is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from a computer or another, but the beauty of plates is... "she drives with a dearable sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it really is unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the semblance the jeans hotpants to patterns, watching a group of young teenagers, grouping themselves for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are superior to buy a crosley turntable.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential boards for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody looks at her - maybe because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to write them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send into the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research shows that the results of YouGov, let them vote, at least in record-shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record-lovers, which exist in reality, record business and in online research.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with security not with the baking through recording outlets from Berwick Street and leaves through plates, while it dominates the rigid view of an uncanny, 30-year-old moderator, who protrudes over the shoulders of no means of middle aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Great Britain at 7-er Rugby came in the final hurdle in the final hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 in the Dealing stage here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji erdivided a master class in handling, side-stepping, descendings and rotating power to win gold - her first olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was reconciled by the not too bad trophy of the Silver medal - Great Britain to this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they smote New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Bocs, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could fall back to them in the finals.</seg>
<seg id="6">But irrespective of that, Fiji could have beaten a 15-man team in a form of a 15-man team.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but it is likely not - that at least a brite tomorrow will have a gold medal to hang his neck: fijis boss-trainer Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, she lost at Ryan each game at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This cap is going to do, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderful and let the attacks GBs out of fun abortions.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. at that one would walk in driving buses. the World Series winner went 5-0 to the top, when Osea Kolinisau went in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes of game, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner, which he walked.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB has barely taken the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A prehensive taps of Mitchell stops the mountain of Mann Leone Nakarawa a third gate, but it has just stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua has a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa, added a new since the revival and has still been over a minute of time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou preset through further weak tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion took a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is so, as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB still stopped.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB resulted in basic changes to the half-time and closed the fijian gap... for all four minutes, what was good for the circumstances of the first half-time until Joshua went up Tuisova according to a brilliant stopplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game was already running long in favor of the South Cauans, whose fans cheeks and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not hard to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by battle with the cancer of the trainer</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no emotinal gold than in these games and that wants to be hot.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first stroke till the last, 220 hard Hieve, who enter into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio since Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though it was only those who were at the ruin, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the Trainers Robin Williams, was allpresent when she ruined the second olympic in two without any tax law, the first women placed in the history of the British sport that put on such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, after all her 39,ter-made use, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant Athleton who gliding over the surface with the elegance of sponge, which does not reflect the type of triomphe it is reflected.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in the ruin there is a battalion to help to the incremental progress which make the difference and there was nobody assistant than the coach, which was not at least 30 months ago if he was able to survive this day when cancer was diagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he is risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer who is operiable and this did it.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do that, he spreads throughout.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty narrow situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio had luck that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which was able to start the break down a minimum, in case that in such circumstances the correct term is.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go back again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet to a time when they said that some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rustling in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even greater.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the inexhaustion of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nervenous morning to talk a little more than usual, and thus tried to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning, which was as captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, "I was this week a emotional wreck. that may be something extreme, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It just reiterates how much me this means how much I and Helen and also Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we would not have one, therefore a massive thanks to him. he is the best trainer in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have a better person for exercising or a better coach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have no race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The pair had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 metres, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to close, Stanning and Glover had a lot in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "stay in the process, stay in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to not let it take away.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, Spirit, Health: singen seniors good</seg>
<seg id="2">The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp her whole life: as young girls, she was in the schooling, she defeated the compartment of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"sing me - emotionally and physically," describes it.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal it feels balanced, cheerful and overall living, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">They do something very well with their health and mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">For Singen is the same from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler from the German seniors.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors singen in the choir and share with like-minded the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular relationships, seniors are able to establish and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often, social and family structures are within the age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir," "" "to speak and organize themselves to be able to leave and learn from one another - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be strenuous in the positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">Because exercise seniors are a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly asks his lungs, even in everyday life is not as fast as the buffer.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if it comes to preserve the sound of the voice at the age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">For older people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz about the Federal Labour Party of the Seniors organizations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations the joint singing had a much higher significance, it belonged to everyday life, both at school and in leisure, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observed that the singing or listening of songs with older men often awakens many memories, often associated with positive emotions of her youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through Liedtexte and especially melodies themselves denying themselves denied events for long back events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing the head is also called a special performance, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, concentrate on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt themselves to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially elderly, who live alone, practice not only on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through the singing in the choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Also the self-esteem grows through the singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show themselves: if I'm long for something, I become better and watchful beyond me - this experience reinforces.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start with singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Whoever wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he means to have little talent, betrays Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="28">You do not sing alone - at 50 siness people who listens to hear, when a sound goes off to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the matching offer, seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sing someone from the acquaintances in a Senorenchor, one can simply connect.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews over the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Who wants to sing in an ecclesiastic choir can turn right into the church or the Church.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many seniors are also found via the internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Who has no access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbours for help with the Internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Who would like to sing, should join in a choir, betray Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul good and has something freeing - this applies to any age.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after they had shot three gates during a 6-1 winner over Japan, Katie made the first two gates for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said, she could not remember that ever did.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I do not belong to the people who keep their gates in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, it knows however, the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Britons on the first place, which remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final match of the first lap.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two teams in their group will gain six teams each from the first and second place.</seg>
<seg id="9">The firstborrowed will take a little longer out of the path that will lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">Whatever the game may go on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprisingly vortex due to their success story, four years after they landed over the past London games on the last of 12 seats.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania in his hands (her two older sisters played the sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became the National Park of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">It missed the Olympiad in 2008 as they could not qualify for the Kader.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012 in which for her and her team went wrong.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year Craig Parnham became a British, trainer of the national team and thus began to turn things to better.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a cultural change, a mental shift and a physical change," said Bam.</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the working time in London that we have now.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have completely snatch the rest of the rest.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday night, Bam opened the cake in the first half of the game with a return from the seam.</seg>
<seg id="20">India has gone into the game without victory in the tournament, but the team showed himself surprisingly heavy and took place from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">They did a Sprint with a flat ball over the left edge, then moved into the middle and airy the ball into the gate to get an 2-0 leadership.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the midst of the course of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is also, it's the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel safe and inevitable, a rapid staggering between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is, as if the Olympic torch itself would be a burning rod, which is drilled from the wristwatch to swimmers to the gymnast to the triathleten.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can not switch the TV to read a newspaper or listen to the talk of your neighbors in queue in the Coffeshop, without using Simone Biles, Katie Lefry or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is a Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's warm with dimples could quite have been sent under these known names that would be sent to Prime Time by sponsors and benefactors, if he would be a swimmers, gymnasts or even feeder.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights in the Olympic trampoline for gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The olympic flame examines not every event the same.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partially in the shadow there are sports, which are not generally recognized: air pistol chery, archery, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swimming, and may it rule long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I could make modest arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charme of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline has been a Olympic event since 2000, when it had been in Sydney, the last 16 years was so sparse that many people I asked, did not know that it is at all an Olympic-porti.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the US has sent athletes to competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline and had a athlete until the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians are inclined to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennon from Canada will defend its gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline has a certain outsilicon charme, partly because it sounds suitable for the unresolved ears suitable for a clownsschule than those for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a grounded enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never to end cloudy - but also the refinement of the turnaround and diving that combines two sports that is essentially united.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as the springboard. "</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging victors jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, heets and odomtos) before they land on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "they are rated according to the official Olympiad after the execution, level of difficulty and" "" "flight time" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Two thousand athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio against each other.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists have to go further in their quest for gold, faster, upwards and penetrating, sometimes up to the destination, sometimes going back and down, upwards and down to the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They do not only hunt the Ziellinie or the source wall, but in television transmission also another cavity objective: the world or the olympic ords.</seg>
<seg id="28">The purposeful pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir up a crowd to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I think even when looking at these games than a bit tiresome.</seg>
<seg id="30">Of this the trampoline offers a reprieve.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A backward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she goes off, seemingly heelos like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back upwards.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even here there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no vaults in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The Qualification and Endurations of the Women will take place on Friday afternoon, in the streaming to 13.00 Eastern Time; those of the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the ends as part of a afternoon blocks on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of Olympia Manie, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that will probably be overlooked in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase of consciousness can be achieved only by the anxiety and the lenses of male athletes, according to The Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr. Dooley expects his air rinse, new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="4">Witnesses say that he was killed in the clashes when the clashes were killed with the police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia right together to break?</seg>
<seg id="6">During the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid foe of the West with a fast growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last few months protests against the government were unwavering over the country and spread themselves in more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people went to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The answer of the government was unmerciful according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses gave us that policemen were shot at seventy unarmed protesters and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">On the move, the videos are located on the protests that probably are from the last or beginning of this year, show how safety people are young people with shocks while they were forced to make a hand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Chief of the UN Security Council for Human Rights is now calling for a further investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it has always been difficult to hold this country and it will be even more difficult," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopians together to fight terror over the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western aid.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expands in the significant pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new swing in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was other than a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continued constantly the repression of the government - the opposition in the country has been limited, whereby dissidents were effective at silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent to exile or prison, killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and do not have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Policies.</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">One generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the floor up to the stranglehold in relation to the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a widespread election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, the tension rise along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line called on June hundreds of lives.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo-liberating Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been more or less forced in recent years, the turbulence could benefit.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of the bitch after years of struggle is now exploding under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems to be harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years many Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media, because cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more common and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially with protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that conceal where they are staying.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave they themselves to be gathered themselves together.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Orom and amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Orom and amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia, mainly Christian highlands, in politics and economics, while they are the Orom exploited, of which many Muslims are and live in flat-areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But also this is changing straight.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate under a umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests in areas of the Amhara and Orom took place.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many amharas and Orom have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military, in trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former Rebelist leader, was until his death on an uninhabited disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopian prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly engaged in taking early signs of discontentment and use special officers to process opponents and make them unharmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks it at this basic skill," "" "said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen from relatively unsighted reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Ireland, Mr. Hailemariam come from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the safety services provided by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the outcome will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia has lived such a turmoil in 2005, after thousands of elections were protested, according to the statements of analyst, apparently from the government and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">While the following sweeps were killed many protesters, even if there were less than in the last months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts Ethiopian Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new Pendlerer, as well as their measurable progress in poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal Missgunst of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protagitation in Gondar, an amharical city, of Tigray guided shops and the hatred of the Tigray is becoming more and more important in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests in the US and other Western allies bring in a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, even if they recently rushed to close this base.</seg>

<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism was down to Mr. Trump, while he tries to steer the focus of his campaign due to falling survey assets on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches at the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried again to return to this issue.</seg>

<seg id="17">But I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest spine is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland - usually only in winter to surface.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an examination on board the sauté panna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h by the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland only got up with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">In common, the Greenland is along the ground of the North Atlantic at an hour, it is an average of just 1.220 meters far.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it arrives, the five meters long animal accelerates at satte 2,6 km / h - and with this maximum speed is half as fast as a robustness.</seg>
<seg id="9">This of long-term lifestyles seems to be a panacea for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science "at least from a Greenland, the 392 years old could be.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "insanity" "", "commented Alexander Scheuerlee of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span that means for vortices a world record." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist already suspected that Greenland become stone old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only missing the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland are difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the skinned coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperature around the six degrees Celsius, they usually dive on the surface mostly only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">About the lifestyle of Greenland know researchers according to little.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her timlupentempo gauges, when they threw up six animals in front of the Spitsbergen six animals with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">Loot make this sharks nevertheless: in the stomach of a beast, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had the jaw-bones of a young ice-bears swallowed.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they hunt sleepy animals or patrol at the bottom of the Eismeeres and are looking for Kadaver, which torques from higher water layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Svalbard as a catch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the biggest 502 centimetres measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens-14 method the lens of sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of Ophthalmology is already created before the birth of sharks, which contained in it later no longer be renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly much carbon-14 in the lens.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s than nuclear weapons try large amounts of this radioactive carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the length of 220 centimetres length of the third animal deplated the lens with a small overshot of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All major Grönlandhaie had normal carbon-14-amounts, which arises from cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-clock showed for a 493 centimetres long Greenland at an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimeters, even 392 years is likely to be.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland females only get offspring if they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers could assign an age to the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably on the brink of sex mature and its age with 156 years was determined, Greenland can obviously become at least one and a half centuries ago.</seg>
<seg id="32">Also this should be for cyclist currently Weltrekord.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methane conditions live above all in eisigen waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record holder, a 211 year old Grönlandwal, in whose bacon at the neck at the neck had put up a 120 year old resin-tip, was caught Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures often the organism of the animals living there live on austerity.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are also often very large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, by which the animal temperate heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much greater than in one grammes elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on as many descendants as early as possible," "" "explains the evolution of evolution." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, a very large animal should invest their resources more into a long life.</seg>

<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate research.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, water-less surface and CO2-dense atmosphere once have been rejected.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation points out that Venus could have had a thin, dant-like atmosphere and nevertheless slowly ascended.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably pointed out more dry regions than the earth, but had once had enough water and geographic variability to stay alive and on faster transcription.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus benefited from a sun that was 30 percent Matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the Venus revolves the slow rotation of Venus their daily side of the Sun almost two months," stated GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which appears like a umbrella out to shield the surface from a large portion of solar heating.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result are average temperatures that are some degree of cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a story of Venus that resembles the evolution previously suspected of planetary research.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was once resounding, the Venus was suspended in the course of several billions years --in much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Her oceans dared dared and their water vapor was burned from the ultraviolet light.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data-lau: so perfide erpresses hackers their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of Ercompressing malware currently hold company targeted companies - and are successful in this process.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey of the malware defense experts Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies have been at least once, partly several victims of an attack with decrees software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, nearly 20 percent of firms were already the target of a ransomware yield.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims paid by the offenders demanded by the perpetrators, in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their yield software according to the observations of Malwarebytes to attack attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially waste ransom ransom is significantly higher than for private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we're currently watching a terrifying fast evolution of the damage software," "" "explains Malwarebytes manager Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "world" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most of the Malwareprograms were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then we discovered the perpetrator software for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "only private users were the goal, but the change to company attacks took place quickly during the past few months." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the computer of a sacrifice, it looks targeted after unlong modified files such as Word-, Excelestial or database files, as well as to archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the software presents the demands of the creation.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final decoding code into the files, the victims need to transfer money - usually in the form of cryptonutrition Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users use the personal photo database on the game, it is about sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly higher the damage is made when a ransomware strikes.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the German companies affected by Ransomware, 13 per cent even had to break the activity completely, in case of a case people were in life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals have been victims of attacks, whose patients may be threatened by the loss of nurses.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we are saying the victims always: pays not, you only promotes the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, get their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult, considering the claim to reject the perpetrators of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hacker again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the safety researchers of F-secure the utility surfaces and the contact with the makers are examined and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They declare their sacrifices by chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, direct accessible support websites, or decrypt for free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And they will redeem a few hundred euros after payments by a few hundred Euros, companies have to pay partly tough and five-digit sums in order to regain their data encrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the ransomware reduction, the hacker is always professional and share the work, explains safety sexperte Chester Wisniewski of anti-virus provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware of about within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">More likely it is that it is three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their damage software then in the form of a software building on the actual yields.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kit arose by the Malware itself, consulting and additional tools purchased for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "included is an adaptation tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," "" "says Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">The results are then looking for further hackers to spread the newly bought software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you logs in one of the forums on the underground, buys the set of a criminals and have another way to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made per set-up calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually, the criminals then bear spammer with the spread" "", "explains Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known by many companies who want to better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of companies responsible in the malwarring survey will rely on the rank of Ransomware using file-back-ups and Scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators already pursue new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data is not sufficient threat to successful recognition, the perpetrators deal instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer list or pricing" "", "explains Malwarebytes head Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">This is the potential for damage, depending on the type of data still much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the future, the perpetrators will also be able to take completely new goals on the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">On the HackerConference Defcon demonstrated security researchers, as they could get a thermostat thermostat under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter the activation of such a so blocked heating as such a ransom could be quite a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrator then instead of the heating in the future block an entire production line in a factory, ransomware could also become an issue in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening you have been eternally lying around, at night it is soak-long, in the morning there is already far in front of the waking clingles not to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good company with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep, and over ten per cent have often feel their sleep often or permanently relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep-disorders differ?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleeping disorders, and there are many causes underlying them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeper, Board member of the German Society for Sleeping and Slemedizin.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one inevitably understands it, but is the Insomnever, so one inhalation and sleepy.</seg>
<seg id="8">Especially the sleep many people feel as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, Board member of the German household association with practice in low-Saxon Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What lies behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it can be organic, mental or solid-related factors, but also medications are stuck.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is not rare the sleeves expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is often common with depression," "" "says Wear." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it may be that different factors beating one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">Those who for example has a band separator can lie badly, wake up all two to three hours and then blurry to greet you about everyday problems and worry, gives Wear one example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should one be with sleep-disorders about the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and is compromised in the day, should go to the doctor\ t Wejora.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment may vary quite differently: one is downcast, tired, uncovered, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily able, has voting fluctuations or bodily ailments like gastric or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to alleviate the sleeping-compulsion, it is important to find their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a treatment options, a cognitive behavioural therapy or even medicines - classic bedrooms occur only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquired.</seg>
<seg id="22">Dutch dormitories exist in Germany hardly, emphasises Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the interdisciplinary dormitory of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, in case of sleep problems, one should contact the doctor's primary care first.</seg>
<seg id="24">The problems can clear whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go into the dormitory, and what happens there?</seg>
<seg id="26">To study in the sleeping laboratory medicine, for example in snoring with respiration, in case of disease-fatigue, with sleeves or if you can not find the cause of a sleeptive disorder, explains Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the investigation you do not have to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "just do not make midday," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After bonding one goes to his normal time into the bed.</seg>

<seg id="1">Alterected, a few linoaks, inter alia still a rest cobbled Streets: the Riga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain affects the first look not so, but the police count her to the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">One walks along the road from east to west, one comes to playground, a freshed nursery and a biolades.</seg>
<seg id="3">To the façade of a gray house is someone "ugly!" checked.</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite of a lidl, which should also be demolished soon, is already built: until 2017, here is a house with high windows and 133 new flats.</seg>
<seg id="5">Article about this "trendy neighborhood" as the competent property owner called Friedrichshain, are preferred in recent weeks however preferably with burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">The ground is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rented apartments, on the ground floor are still spaces occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, the Berlin intersenator Highs had been committed to a tough action of the police against the project, the area called "No-Go-Zone" for policemen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After June 22nd, the rooms were cleared on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, the police took three weeks long official statements, with 30 to 40 officials and three teams on the spot, spersed parts of the road and kept visitors from the house to enter the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, renovated building workers on behalf of the unknown homeowners the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Board of Directors decided that the clearance had been illegal, and a day later went police and builders under the jubilation of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the street is peaceful: parents go walking with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others entertained himself späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house-projects there are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the principal of many inhabitants: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives since 1999 in the Kiez, and Jana *, which attracts three children, are mostly dominated by the police presence of genervt.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the household projects, they split the concern in front of rising mixes and centertification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a juniz who wish to make several serficially polishing protection against vandalient left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, den of the Berlin internal senator and the police between households and their neighbours, does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional workers "district, which today reached a lower and high poverty risk today compared to the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also house occupations and the resulting residential projects belong long to the Kiez: in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost all the Mainzer street very close to the Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was evacuated under a large police battle in a regular street laughing, many of the projects were legalized in the rig and are still occupied by the people who occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the part of the district in recent years has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and electors from all over the world: with them, the inhabitants of the GDR and former household members are now settled in their pines.</seg>
<seg id="21">This also noticeable in the mistaken, which has increased by nearly 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the rig are attacked as symbols for this development: one recognises them in the worshiped discs or freshly proverted facades, which were rejected by shade.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other road was mentioned this year together with the words" "" "linksautonous violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason why not all neighbours consider that as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: criminal offences such as body breach is subject to statistics almost exclusively against police officers.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most part of the criminal offences make damage, the biased rather the new buildings and newly renovated houses meet.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94, can be no talk of insecurity.</seg>
<seg id="27">As far as violence is concerned, it is shameful: people in the 94 are their neighbours that would not have been determined this.</seg>
<seg id="28">Also the famous burning cars will not give it directly in the rig for longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect, her street is not a crime focal point, on the contrary: "here one helps each other, lives together on the road and gets more than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer was deliberately pulled into the rig street - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">For this reason, it was also so important that the residents get back their street: from the police, politics and the media, all of which suddenly claimed the interpretation of the neighborhood in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of the inhabitants such as Neugebauer, the road will continue to be taken away: through sightly reconstructions in former building gaps, which impose the old residents.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "they are ultimately property apartments which are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so good" "", "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "violence and destruction I can absolutely not see." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should you do when one never listens to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There are frustration on all sides, even at the police and the residents.</seg>
<seg id="37">For Zugezogenic, who annoyed on colour bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Whoever moves, should be aware - just like someone who runs into a pub that can complain about noise there.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons mentioned only with names of names have asked to be called by their right name</seg>

<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">And she is a social worker on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle the refugee officer for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogin supports the team of management by Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees himself as a contact person for all actors: refugees, working and refugee assistance, administration, authorities and who else mischives.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine's customer of the working circle indicates that the volunteer is more than grateful that Deuschle now is there, the experience of wool, which is above all a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">So some - less spicious as rather on the multitude of desire-looking-purposeful - meant when the administration wanted to write the site.</seg>
<seg id="9">Looking for a administration of management with a talent for languages and people, coupled with many years of experience in the field of social work, just an aggregate wool.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Most of all, I go to organization, work with local people and also behind the scenes, as well as network service.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been here for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent priority for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine Customer that Annika Deuschle ehr- and full-time actors support.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and minor problems, organisational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon there are new containers in the Washer Road</seg>
<seg id="17">A heavy problem has been a serious problem for some time, apartments for the refugees who have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for connecting.</seg>
<seg id="19">You have to place the refugees in your own or rented apartment.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs of the construction, the rent or the refurbishment of these accommodations must carry the municipalities itself.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the counties to the commune and the job centre.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been a very difficult time for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are so far not to be relied on private apartments, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, the most common apartments must be cured, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are placed in the washing-way.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine Customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">Apart from a firm lead, it is practicrates, training centers, one-euro jobs and helpless activities for refugees and migrants that have been frozen or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reported Regine Customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help schoolmaster, do-profit work - and this motivates and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive impact.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no employment therapy" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "but does not mean work only." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">The day need a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">The people would have to develop a sense of being.</seg>
<seg id="38">So there are offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">So you also jump here administration and volunteering.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling, they are welcome in Germany and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "" "" "they must declare the refugees that it takes and they can make sense of sense, for example with language courses." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who eventually develop the feeling that could not help in Urbach, do not work and be useless, which will never be integrated.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">Problem cases, but also, says customer honestly, "people, where nothing is going on." the work of Deuschle and client is therefore always something to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is a" "" "mammability task" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two after the recent occurrence of radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine customer quite clearly," "" "what might be naïve naïve" "". "a residual risk could not and if it does not want to exclude it." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensitizes the helpers but already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have been afraid that attacks bring them completely into distortion.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would love to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So you need to keep track of major and honorary position on the spot and in the region according to activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that soon a new shock could come to refugees and migrants to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question is clear to answer, shy the politics.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to place them heroines on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we are not yet arrived, where we would like," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine's customer also makes clear that Urbacher are already familiar with it to be reasonable to the previous person.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, one must help them both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is as complicated as there are no simple answers.</seg>
