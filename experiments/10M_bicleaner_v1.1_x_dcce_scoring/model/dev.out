Obama receiving calls
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not friendly .
the two wanted to oppose the implementation of the international agreement as well as about Teheran &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
but the meeting was also meant to address the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution .
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense .
Washington is critic@@ ised the long @-@ lasting sett@@ ling of Israel and casts a def@@ ying will at the peace process .
in the deal of Obama &apos;s prime deal about Iran &apos;s nuclear programme , the relationship of the two has deteri@@ or@@ ated .
in March , Netanyahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the re@@ public@@ ans before the US Congress , which was partly as an aff@@ ront against Obama .
the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the im@@ min@@ ent election in Israel .
in an emergency call , professor , his girlfriend are shot up
in an emergency , Professor Sh@@ annon was a somewhat tense voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and had had the officials to come to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but still live and probably excited , and he said , the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inside the house , the officials found the corp@@ se of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written notice that was put on a white block : &quot; I wanted to und@@ o it , I loved it , I loved it . I stood according to the authorities in the letter and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who was living in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , under@@ arranged 300 miles on the school grounds , where he placed himself by the police a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office and killed .
Delta State University National chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that all @-@ work staff listened to the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb has made the Cat@@ astrop@@ hic Emer@@ ald sometime later .
by the end of the day there was another death : lam@@ b took the life , when the police demanded him .
for a day after the s@@ late in the university , the students and teachers are forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get an idea of what was motivated .
the details origin@@ ating from the investig@@ ators to both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees , who knew him , helped us to outline an image of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers .
students said that they were happy about his teaching .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he has no history of violence or crimin@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself had written in a book written by himself in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both studied in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose Ca@@ vern@@ osa 17 members encomp@@ asses , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time there were some incl@@ inations to difficult behaviour .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised , he also seemed a little excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him to do at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 with stress .
Lamb previously had asked the Delta State University for a wai@@ ving of health reasons and said that he could have any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
the latest changes in the employment policy of the University det@@ ects that the promotion , for the Lamb so hard , for him would not represent a guarantee for an automatic way to a position as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; universal President William La@@ For@@ ge said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he does not know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are questions I can no longer answer .
after the escape from the campus the police later found the lam@@ bs track when he returned to the Mississippi from Ark@@ ans@@ as import .
before he was arrested , he killed themselves autonom@@ ously with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back yard of a house about a mile south of his parent on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , told Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still running in the dri@@ v@@ eway .
it was not immediately clear why lam@@ b went to this house , but Johnson said that she knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 he began his work at the university that took 3,@@ 500 students in a city with 12,000 residents and studied geography and education .
he received his doct@@ orate in the spring of education .
among the many years of female friends lam@@ bs him as intelligent , char@@ ism@@ atic and funny .
Carla H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lam@@ b was 20 when they met through joint friends .
she and her friends were at high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to join her guitar playing .
he was at that time the woman &apos;s don@@ uts .
all girls are mel@@ ted when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson city of Bran@@ don .
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
in the not@@ ary &quot; I said &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no knowledge of a marriage .
you had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house that adjacent to a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced from 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who now was 19 years old .
&quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en over his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he never met her , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that he was interested in music and blues played .
in Lamb , she met Pr@@ enti@@ um@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail had both appeared on a summer market for three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked online for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ art@@ eper , and sometimes entertaining coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he &apos;s from Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ um@@ iel Night in the night of September 5th , when he finished his guitar and mouth harmon@@ i@@ iel before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign of this , that something was not vo@@ iced .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were on clean and sh@@ aded each other .
I mean , they both had good sense for jo@@ kes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , directed the first semester seminar program and specialised in American history and colonial history , Don All@@ an Mitch@@ ell , an English professor at school .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also distinguished for personal reasons .

UN boss says , there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says that his response to Russia has increased military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years lasting conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN Chief is calling for once again all parties , including the shared UN Security Council to uni@@ fy and integr@@ ative negotiations to finding a political solution .
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to discuss the foreign ministers of the five Permanent Member States of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the end of the Annual General Meeting today to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ ts that the coun@@ ties in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers can make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Ban said the five permanent members to show solidarity and unity in addressing the crisis in Syria , which have demonstrated it in achieving a nuclear decre@@ e with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 Re@@ frac@@ tional values that make Donald Tru@@ mp is serious .
some have tried to make it a flop to brand @-@ brand marks .
others have taken it as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some re@@ public@@ ans attempt to draw Donald Tru@@ mp from the upper ranks in surveys below , it has ( yet ) does not work .
ten of the last eleven surveys revealed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit area , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
none affir@@ ms that Tru@@ mp is likely to win the republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphas@@ ise that at this time in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys is handed over to the rising Herman C@@ ain , from which nobody has only won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but out@@ sides head@@ ings like J@@ eb Bus@@ hs Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth are now realizing Tru@@ mp@@ s diar@@ rhe@@ a and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values that suggest that the real estate is not only a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mp@@ s popularity levels have turned around 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced its can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two out of ten re@@ public@@ ans looked positively to the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l .
by the middle of July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
now , six out of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three of ten predi@@ ctions that they have a negative opinion .
and these numbers keep themselves in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac @-@ vote in I@@ owa has established last week that 60 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Republi@@ can , they would be either &quot; delighted &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tru@@ mp was nominated .
only two of 10 say they would be &quot; angry , &quot; if he would be the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) .
the next thing in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say that they are &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the Favor@@ ite of Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the candidate .
a majority of the Republi@@ can sees Tru@@ mp@@ s temper@@ ament as problem .
while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critic@@ ised for its bom@@ bas@@ tic and al@@ ur@@ ging statements , 52 per cent of the Irish public@@ ans believed that the real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is considered in the first pre @-@ state of the nation , the federal state I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Re@@ public@@ ans think he has the personality for an over@@ com@@ mander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively perform his office , and nearly six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament was not in White House p@@ asse , ABC / post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
if they put their nests , republi@@ can voters Tru@@ mp hold for real .
if they are asked , who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C , last week four out of ten that Tru@@ mp is the best bet .
that was a change since the time when four out of ten end of July put their money to J@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P vot@@ ers in the past did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this point in the last cycle four out of ten Re@@ public@@ ans that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination towards the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it shows that a wide range of GO@@ P di@@ ers can be plau@@ sible as plau@@ sible .
even if the re@@ public@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tru@@ mp strikes almost everybody .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some experts pointed out that the sh@@ atter@@ proof field probably contributes to Tru@@ mp@@ s guidance during the anti @-@ Tru@@ mp support to more than a dozen different candidate diff@@ uses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ at @-@ head @-@ head between Tru@@ mp and most other republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp the multi @-@ health support is harv@@ ested .
he has placed in front of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points , before Walker Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before edge Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ in @-@ head @-@ race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who k@@ icks him ?
Ben Car@@ son would be over@@ hau@@ led the entrepreneurs with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ in @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald @-@ Tru@@ mp @-@ fans said that they have formed their minds .
a new survey of CB@@ S / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the elec@@ torate , the Tru@@ mp support they say they have established their votes .
of course , much can happen to change this , and no one can truly say , never change the opinion .
46 percent said that they leave the door open to change other candidates .
nevertheless , Tru@@ mp@@ s is strongest ri@@ val competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon &apos;s Ben Car@@ son , but voters say that they have formed their minds are twice as common to Tru@@ mp .
six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say they are consistent with Tru@@ mp in the issue of immigration .
since then , Donald Tru@@ mp in his election campaign launched two months ago immigrants from Mexico &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; was migration - and ful@@ crum at public discourse in 2016 .
some are concerned by the bom@@ bas@@ tic out@@ pressure of Tru@@ mp , H@@ isp@@ ano Americans will retain control of the Republi@@ can Party and damage the EU @-@ oriented efforts .
but after the new ABC / post survey on Monday six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp in questions of immigration .
as long as immigration remains in the spot@@ light , it will also do Donald Tru@@ mp seem to do .
the frustration concerning the government climb over new high@@ s .
by Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son now , about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , is in particular by their out@@ si@@ ders status .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six out of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Monday survey of ABC / Post , they would rather want a political out@@ si@@ der as anyone with government experience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also angry in Washington .
a survey of Des Mo@@ ines Register / Bloomberg in I@@ owa 3 weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa @-@ Re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated over the re@@ public@@ ans in the Congress with 54 per cent of &quot; and 21 per cent . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential locations in Germany
here in the Hob@@ ok@@ en@@ weg , the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea .
on the road there is a square meter in a pri@@ mor@@ ed house at an average of 7@@ 3.@@ 300 Euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt the offer of objects naturally is limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore it is in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study reveals , in which special clim@@ ates a square meter is most costs .
of course , 18.@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student holiday in Munich are not really low .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top locations , the price is just like pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider angels &amp; Völ@@ ker has published a list of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square met@@ res@@ o prices in c@@ unning par excellence .
there are several ten thousand Euros Phoenix - per square meter , well marked .
but well , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is an exception here , not at the top .
Champions League : Bavaria dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
tw@@ o@@ fold scor@@ er in Piraeus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller simply has a run .
an happ@@ ier hit by Thomas Müller @-@ blessed the FC Bayern the way to a earned 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ch@@ os Pir@@ eus - then ran .
a sovereign bar@@ ener of the Champions League season .
the World Champions Thomas Müller and Mario Di@@ ze have sh@@ opped up a dream start in the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; in Hex@@ enk@@ es@@ sel of Pir@@ ates .
the team of Trainer PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their launch in the Champions League at the Greek record champion of the hottest atmosphere thanks to gar@@ bage bi@@ als ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and i@@ dol @-@ matches ( 8@@ 9th ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth star entrance in Serie should be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola will finally take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
Müller received his 28 results in the Champions League at the Champions League for the help of his opponents of Olympi@@ ad @-@ go@@ al@@ Roberto , who caused a f@@ lange of the world &apos;s thought .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; did Bayern @-@ Kap@@ itä@@ n Philipp Lah@@ m before the game in Kar@@ a@@ is@@ k@@ akis , promised in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 of hot @-@ b@@ lossom fans - and the Munich held a word .
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea , without shine .
Piraeus had won his recent six home@@ work in the Königs@@ class , including against well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 there was also Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria , in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams were not defeated , did not want to be the next victim .
they were coura@@ geous , but in their aggressive efforts they often go into work .
the attacks were introduced too often via transfer to Link@@ so@@ d Douglas Costa , which was rarely through the former A@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller was from the right more luck when his f@@ langes from the right half field hit the upper left panel .
during the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
initially , when the Olympi@@ ad of ide@@ ye took on the head of Poland from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct removal , the go@@ al@@ keeping Roberto with the knee was saved ( 3@@ 5. ) .
although Bavaria started its usual dominant game , Pi@@ re@@ aus could put needle .
but on Tor@@ be@@ ter Manuel Neu@@ er was publishing .
so about , when he had a shot of ide@@ ye over the lan@@ te forces ( 5@@ 6th ) .
in front of Neu@@ er Gu@@ ardi@@ ola made a quadru@@ ple with David Al@@ aba in the centre beside Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it well .
Mario Göt@@ z , according to mus@@ cular problems back in the ca@@ vern , sat mostly outdoors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Championship hero was given first light after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; News Sam@@ mer said at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to make something different from it , this is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the first altern@@ ation Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was decided against him as he brought King@@ ley Com@@ an for the Lew@@ k@@ und Lew@@ k@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Göt@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6th ) and made 13 minutes later everything clearly , by El@@ f@@ meter , Müller still placed a dr@@ on .
in front of the game , it was at the stadium of Kra@@ w@@ alle .
after a smaller group of partly per@@ ished Bavaria , in their viewer &apos;s block , the supporters of Hosts Pir@@ ates had prov@@ oked the security forces with words and gest@@ ures , attacked the security forces and went over against the König@@ splatz in Munich .
at least a Bayern @-@ Fan was in@@ ju@@ red up of the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk to lose teeth
who smo@@ kes so that not only does the lungs , but also the teeth - that sets close to Pots@@ damer Platz Study .
the good news : does the risk decrease quickly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk to lose their teeth early .
this is derived from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutri@@ tion@@ Research ( DI@@ CA@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smoking non @-@ smoking , the risk of losing their teeth was pre@@ matur@@ ely increased by the 2,@@ 5@@ - 3,@@ 6 @-@ fold .
the scientists had observed more than 23@@ ,000 participants .
major contribut@@ ors for tooth loss be dental c@@ aries and inflammation of the g@@ um line , empha@@ sizes the DI@@ CA@@ E .
for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis smoking is a risk factor , stress the authors .
the connection between smoking and tooth loss therefore go back to most frequent dental car@@ vings with smo@@ kers .
not clear , to what extent smoking can also increase the risk of dental c@@ aries .
people who dis@@ miss with smoking could however decrease its risk within a short time , the researchers in &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the threat goes back to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the initial author Thomas Dietrich from the British University of Birmingham . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you must convince people of being non @-@ smo@@ kers , stated student H@@ einer Boeing of the DI@@ CA@@ E : &quot; Smo@@ ke@@ ens the life time . &quot;
not too smoke is good for lung and vessels and leads to our findings even to a good dental well being to the high age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population age 65 to 74 years of dental treatment , DI@@ CA@@ E distributed the DI@@ CA@@ E .
earlier investigations have already pointed out that smoking can increase the risk for early crash .
the new long @-@ term study will limit the findings .
archae@@ ologists encounter the Köl@@ ner Rhein@@ u@@ fer on Res@@ te from the late anti@@ quity
for repeated time have been made on the right Rhein@@ u@@ fer in Cologne arche@@ ological discoveries .
in the vicinity of the construction site for the new Rhin@@ eland , arche@@ ologists have been excav@@ ated by the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ museum skel@@ et@@ ons and res@@ te of historical buildings , said the museum leader Marcus Trier on Tuesday .

in all building projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always being added as a expert for arche@@ ological foundations and monuments .
in the third section of the Rhine @-@ bou@@ lev@@ ards the archae@@ ologists were now found .

beside the rem@@ n@@ ants of the fortress and the cherry @-@ tree there was also a cemetery discovered with approximately 350 graves that probably belonged to the church .

EU Commission proposes a new court in disputes over TTIP
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to improve the argument over the planned Trans@@ atlantic Trade Agreement , the EU Commission proposed a large reform of the current arbitration system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controversial private arbitration facilities for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which corresponds to its function significantly more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to create a system that trust the citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the competent EU Commissioner Cecilia Malm@@ ström in the presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wed@@ n@@ oses presented the proposal as a European negotiating with the US as a European negotiating with the US .
the German government announced support .
the TTIP will develop the largest free @-@ trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plans to reform the current arbitration proceedings particularly fores@@ ee that the EU states and the US chose independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are equal to equal parts of the EU , the USA and third countries .
is intended for the first time a second instance .
it would allow it to raise awareness of judgment .
until now the procedures participated among each other at the refer@@ ee , an objection to their judgments were not available .
in the discussion of the past months , it has become clear that citizens are not familiar with the old IS@@ DS system in fairness and justice , commented on Malm@@ ström .
in the long run , it wants to work according to its own indications in an international investment court .
there could be clari@@ fied any dispute between Chinese companies and EU states for example .
the investor @-@ state arbitration ( IS@@ DS ) first of all , is known as one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbitration bu@@ cks is critici@@ zed by critics as a kind of parall@@ el@@ ism , over the companies compens@@ ators for tax@@ pay@@ ers , national laws or to enforce such reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
in the first comments , anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act , the proposals of the European Commission are insufficient .
it was critici@@ zed most notably that they are not supposed to apply for the already negotiated trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German economic state Secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) signed the plans in contrast to great progress .
the Commission considered essential points , the Federal Minister of Agriculture set up in the spring with other EU @-@ trade ministers .
the old system of private arbitration tri@@ but@@ t from the table .
even the French government welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European firm B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ SE@@ ES@@ SE@@ U@@ RO@@ PE was previously , limiting the functioning of the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
when the talks on TTIP , TTIP ( Trans@@ atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ) could be continued on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been running since mid 2013 .
however , the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally a framework for the agreement was already at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is considered to be no more durable .
wonderful Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens is on the stage at the Köl@@ ner Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
beside him there is a fli@@ p@@ chart , which the shy left @-@ singer has recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with fil@@ z@@ sti@@ ft .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is virtually taken by Mr. Stev@@ ens .
he tells the number of different places he always records on the map and report about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and delicate songs .
where they were created and how it looks , in his homeland .
since then , Stev@@ ens has been proven to be wonderfully creative .
with 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State , &quot; the Great Lake State &quot; appear n smart comp@@ ass@@ ated songs that en@@ bro@@ aden their harmon@@ i@@ ously very close to American folk , the late six@@ ties , but can be turned into great .
the smells arises , &quot; Michigan &quot; would be the first part of a playful series : each of the 50 U.S. states that are to be classified as a result .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and in the Rhin@@ eland , there are already &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and some positive expectations already breaks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reduced the Stev@@ ens here .
live meet him guitar and ban@@ jo .
one year later the musicians will return to the series in New York .
with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) appears in 2005 a surface @-@ filled masterpiece .
over@@ lap on ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album desc@@ ends into the American Bill@@ board charts and is not missing in any annual list of the influential music media .
after extremely productive experiments , Stev@@ ens comes with the &apos; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic Vers@@ ati@@ pieces .
this sixth study album is still widely orchest@@ rated , however from programmed sequences or Be@@ ats wear and plays with very kinds effect and hall .
long ago the smaller clubs en@@ acted , the stage shows will pass here to the colorful spectacle from ne@@ on @-@ forehead and large fluor@@ escent s@@ und@@ ende@@ ko .
currently touring Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens as part of a five @-@ member band from Germany .
in the dark of the ham@@ burger More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; theatre presents mainly the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even though here almost 2000 guests are rel@@ ished to sit in their chairs , the s@@ ard Stev@@ ens returns back to intimacy and to folk .
without having a word to judge the audience , the group plays an excellent musician by the wide @-@ enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the audience you hear : the talk is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; op@@ ul@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and you can drop the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; record &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only to an enc@@ ore , Stev@@ ens impres@@ ses , plays with very old songs and finally tends to fall under the applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n debut at the fra@@ gment of the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ bi@@ n &apos;s debut in the fra@@ gment of the Prime Minister with voltage is expected
the new Labour @-@ Chair of Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is to give his debut in the Prime Minister &apos;s get @-@ up and to make it the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to adjust the first of its six specified questions shortly after noon , with his performance from the media probably and the Labour MPs from the region .
he called for &quot; fewer theatres and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he also said that he could transfer some sessions to leave it to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ bi@@ n@@ n &apos;s guidance , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ el@@ et and after his speech at the Tu@@ c Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour Party conven@@ ed , on Tuesday during the singing board during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , critic@@ ising a number of T@@ ory MPs and stands in the center of several theme @-@ stories about the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision to not sing the national hym@@ ns , has attracted attention to himself
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said , he was in dis@@ respectful of silence &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ en Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour @-@ chairman , to sing the Labour @-@ chairman , &quot; independently &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of shadows ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top mann@@ ers and they were called to differences in economics , defence and foreign affairs , while less than one @-@ sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party initially supported it as leaders .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also st@@ ackable within the Labour Party Conference and Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s comments on the position of the European Union and the limitation of women .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the Tu@@ c Conference , that Labour changes set in order to remove the whole idea of a bo@@ unds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ Labour and R@@ ent Minister said the Party &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very clear &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that it is only against the government plans to limit the limit of 26.@@ 000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour chair , who is David Cameron since he has since been a T@@ ory boss in the last decade at the disp@@ ens@@ ky @-@ box in the parliament for over the last decade .
the Labour Chair , who promised a different policy approach , says he has given &quot; Cro@@ w@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP said that the fra@@ gment of the Prime Minister is to confront confron@@ t@@ atively , and that he has under@@ took advantage of &quot; t@@ wit@@ ty &quot; and fighting with bar@@ bs and instead of focusing on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , who is represented in him with the shadow of economics , if he does not take part - for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the House , I addressed to discuss the problem .
when he was leaders in 2005 , Mr Cameron wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le @-@ Theatre &quot; who often linked himself to the Prime Minister . but a few years later he found that he failed .
since they had been broadcast on TV first in 1990 , he was regarded as the most important Bar@@ ometer by the Prime Minister of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position under his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics had ar@@ gues that they became a caric@@ ature and expresses widespread reforms .

pounds rise to accelerated roll growth in the United Kingdom
the pound was br@@ ittle back according to data , which show an increase in the growth growth of the United Kingdom . at the same time the FT@@ SE was increased by the Geb@@ ot@@ s@@ goal SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July the result of all bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
the percentage of this percentage has been the quick@@ est , and er@@ ased estim@@ ations over the time of a rate raise .
the pound got increased by more than 1 % compared to the dollar on $ 1.@@ 55@@ 05 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the Euro on € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index concluded with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % on 6.@@ 22@@ 9.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after taking over the Rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the two largest brewer@@ ies of the world and brands like Bud@@ ě@@ jo@@ ys , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ ner @-@ shares were according to encouraging messages from the competition Group for luxury products ri@@ chem@@ a 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Ri@@ chem@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures beat all expectations and demonstrated that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - announces growth .
shares of Gl@@ enc@@ ore rose by 5 % , after the mining ri@@ ese said that he has taken EUR 2.5 billion by a share selling at the time of his strategy of debt reduction .
the shares of the packaging and paper company MO@@ N@@ DI were the biggest los@@ ers in the index , although with a decrease of 4.3 % , after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had placed his assessment of the company rating based on &apos; sell &apos; .
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.@@ 1 % , after the pre @-@ year business division had reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first @-@ year period .
the chef from J@@ D Sports says that higher wages may end@@ anger our expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employee could mean more buying power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that the buying force will be the higher labour costs in his company , he says .
the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean it gives less extra jobs .

PE@@ GI@@ DA poster brings Leban@@ ese idea by Silber@@ baum
potatoes or d@@ ön@@ ers ?
it goes both - and indeed in the potato res@@ eller who has developed the Ol@@ den@@ burger Im@@ b@@ iss@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ h@@ ay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potato &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster by the PE@@ GI@@ DA movement , Al@@ h@@ ay potato and meat has put together on a sp@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster with the PE@@ GI@@ DA demonstration with the wording of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potatoes instead of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potatoes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which he had seen on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , in his shop the barbe@@ cu@@ es filled with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is multi @-@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ h@@ ay .
the idea has meanwhile led to the Patent Office in Munich in the meantime .
it has recently been used as a utility model according to the authority of the authority .
how much meat and how much potatoes of the sp@@ it contains , Al@@ h@@ ay wants not to be betra@@ yed .
only so much : &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; he finds .
the culinary international understanding also comes along with its customers .
Met@@ cash starts ground @-@ fixing campaign to fight al@@ dic incident
Met@@ Cash is trying to protect the Ig@@ A stores from an Al@@ di @-@ march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ Cash has launched a cruise campaign to defend market share of Ig@@ A retailer in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million US $ Al@@ di invasion .
during Al@@ di the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and Ig@@ A @-@ supermarkets are expanding their relationship with local food suppliers and build the brand Ig@@ A through mainstre@@ am marketing and marketing through social media on , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A @-@ dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who has been distributed in Ig@@ A @-@ shops and shop @-@ owner , who imported tickets for the South Australian football field at loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will report further details of its defense strategy on 29 September when the wholes@@ aler for Food , Al@@ co@@ hol and devices passed its annual investors strategy .
it is a lot in the game since South Australia and Western Australia have nearly 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A @-@ shop @-@ shops and generate higher profits as a Met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A network into the Eastern states .
Le@@ ad buyers in South Australia and Western Australia have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia , and 24 percent in Western Australia , compared to about 14 per cent in Eastern Australia .
however , an@@ alysts such as Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Al@@ di twelve months after opening of its first markets , about five percent of the food market will be rolled out in these two states and take away all the existing actors , but mainly get independent retailers .
one in this week published results , analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley that Ig@@ A @-@ retailers might lose $ million dollars a year and Met@@ cash 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this progn@@ osis is based on assum@@ ing that Al@@ di in the next year 25 stores at SA and 30 in WA , and generates sales of 500 million $ and 600 million in every market .
the loss in food and grocery store and in the quantities on Met@@ cas@@ hs high Fi@@ x@@ cost , Met@@ cash could cost roughly $ 13 million before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares in the Eastern states , mainly at Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that Ig@@ A @-@ Le@@ ad are the most addi@@ tive .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumed that Met@@ cas@@ hs revenues in food and grocery store are 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.4 percent in 2017 and 2.@@ 1 per cent in the year 2018 , and will reduce the market share by 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading Fon@@ ds@@ manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , at a business dinner in Melbourne , that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade . metering will disappear .
Met@@ ett@@ refused it to respond publicly to the comment of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a committee of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass last week has made contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
s market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenue from Met@@ cas@@ hs foods and food stores , who like about 1,@@ 200 Ig@@ A retailers , has enjoyed 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the operating debt reduction of sales and margins .
the wholes@@ aler won however and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to sell prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ what &apos;s at hundreds of products every week and Ig@@ A retailers in improving their shops by getting faster growing fresh foods and deliver better selection of private label food products .
Met@@ cas@@ hs chief business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and shop programs can be put to El@@ an and hopes that the wholes@@ al@@ ers will return for the first time in four years to come back to profit .
Than@@ es@@ Kok@@ te@@ akis is supported by the President of the Australian tennis courts Steve He@@ aly .
Than@@ es@@ Kok@@ te@@ akis deserves more praise than criticism for its behavior .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ te@@ akis was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral warning &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Mas@@ gios and deserves praise as criticism for his / her own behaviour .
Kok@@ te@@ akis , the younger of the talented du@@ os , which is always known as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; went through the in@@ famous confrontation of Kyr@@ gios with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters into the spot@@ light .
in a fi@@ ery qualification game in Cinc@@ inn@@ ati soon after gradu@@ ating , Kok@@ kin@@ akis had to be split up and his opponent Ry@@ an Har@@ rison had to hit twice through the arbitr@@ ator : &quot; Wa@@ w@@ in@@ ka would have to hit the prison , and I should propose the child . &quot;
while he recently witnessed how he was a tennis r@@ acqu@@ et , after a c@@ resc@@ ents turned up a potential US Open @-@ victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ te@@ akis of He@@ aly was ste@@ ad@@ fast defended .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth , about the second place in the individual behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup @-@ finals on Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing about which I vali@@ date me is a fact that after my view Than@@ es@@ asi was a little bit involved in the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has been cr@@ ush@@ ed a bat when he lost because of a power struggle in the US Open , but he is not the first player who broke a bat from frustration with himself and I know Than@@ es@@ well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has worked extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him and I believe he was treated a little too strict .
he is a very mature 19 year , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never worked a problem with the other players , he is worked hard , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged on his own merits .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to take into account by taking the important decision @-@ up on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right for all , but he secur@@ es the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term steady piece into the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is fully focused on the competition and not all the controversy around &#91; gios &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly .
and I believe that Nick has quickly made the rise of what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray . he asc@@ ends into the eyes of the public , and we try to support him , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside of the spot@@ light , in which he can only think about it , I consider it &apos;s best for the team and it is best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains its shelter , close the borders , holding refugees back
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary explains the state and ri@@ dden the south border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all that were trying to come illeg@@ ally in the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
chaos followed by the border , as hundreds of migrants joined in a no country , and some Serbian officials worked with rebellion .
people who had fled from violence to set up a rest@@ less time in a country strip off the street between the two check@@ points of the countries and built tents , and settled down there .
but frustration went on .
as a police helicopter above them , the migrants &quot; open the border &quot; open the border ! &quot; and cried ins@@ ults for the police force police .
some are returned from protest foods and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that immigrants from Hungary would return , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a collision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have to take talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence to the Hungarian @-@ Ser@@ b border came one day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ Block at a strict meeting in Brussels not agree on a common immigration policy .
the Ministers agreed , however , to share the responsibility for 40@@ ,000 people who studied in surviving Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be realized that the EU states would include further 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the continent of the continent .
but Hungary won &apos;t hope its hopes for a close action from Brussels or its neighbours .
on Tuesday , there was more competences in two southern regions to get more powers to get out of the crisis , so that they were able to lock and accelerate asylum seekers .
the Hungarian Minister for Foreign Affairs , Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country is also planning to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after completing a fence along the Serbian border .
CB@@ S News @-@ Cor@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even pr@@ isons in the competition to create the bar@@ bed fence j@@ aw between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a significant EU @-@ line from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to a substantial shortage , and to the entrance point into the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , has insi@@ sted that most of the refugees refugees are in search of better lives , and non @-@ people refugees who are entitled to protection - a view which is strongly contrary to other EU countries , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws that occurred at midnight in Hungary , do the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) heigh@@ ted by the government along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws also put higher den@@ unci@@ ations for condemned human men .
&quot; due to the situation that came into being through the mass migration , the Hungarian government declared the state of emergency , &quot; said government spokes@@ man on tan Kov@@ acs re@@ por@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eged .
we say it very clear : illegal border cross@@ ings is a crime .
the parliament needs to agree with the use of the military still to the use of the military , who is expected for next week , but re@@ por@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen on the border to armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on occasion .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security advis@@ ors for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people try to cross the border , 15 others were already penet@@ rated deeply into the country .
they come before they def@@ ends the fence , they are now in police @-@ food , and shall be accused of criminal off@@ ences according to the new law .
authorities are there to fix the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials joined the Tuesday morning as well as two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a rail road with bar@@ bed @-@ wire to close the borders .
chaos conver@@ ts the most important border crossing of Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pressing a crowd to push themselves up there .
about 20 managed to enter , but thousands were staying out .
a further group of migrants blocked the most important auto@@ bahn connections of Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse to travel between Hungary and water until they travel to Hungary .

the former US Secretary of Hill@@ ary Clinton still keeps a two @-@ digit head start in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders will win their face to the ground .
Clinton has now supported the 47 percent of democratic voters in the presidential elections ( 58 percent ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced , whether he system provides for the presidential system , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the presidential election .
more than five months before the start of the pre @-@ elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is to which candidates support them .
however , Clin@@ ton Sup@@ ports are more firmly bound to that of the other candidates .
since the CB@@ S @-@ News survey , Clinton has lost a series of demo@@ graphic groups , while S@@ anders has achieved some gains .
Clinton is a big lead in women and mixtures , but these proj@@ ections have dimin@@ ished .
your support for the men is significantly dropped , and S@@ anders is only with 5 points back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clin@@ tons benefit at democratic voters under 50 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prov@@ ok@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and they are and S@@ anders are at the same height . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Clinton has a big head start with the older voters .
last month , Clinton had a two @-@ point lead in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the presidential elections pro@@ es@@ sively say that they would like to support President Clinton if they would have been nominated by the party .
a quarter would support her with some sen@@ iors and another 15 percent would only support her because she &apos;s the nom@@ inee .
six percent would not support them .
maybe not surprising that Clin@@ ton &apos;s latest supporters is mainly enthusiastic about you .
the views are stronger bl@@ ended with those who currently Clinton does not support - only about a quarter would help them enthusias@@ tically .
while 48 per cent of the democratic voters of the elections say they would like to support Clinton with enthusiasm , less republi@@ can voters say this about its top @-@ channel data of Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 % ) .
if Clin@@ ton supporters can be asked in an open question why they want them the nom@@ inee as it is the correct experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it &apos;s time to say that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 % ) .
at Clin@@ ton Sup@@ ports , their association with Bill Clinton ( 9 % ) is also mentioned .
consent to the handling of problems and the constitu@@ encies are also cited .
as the vice @-@ president raises the potential for the presidential system , 57 percent of the democratic voters of the presidential elections wish to see him in the race - although a third believes it should not do it .
if democratic voters are asked by the elections , who would be their second choice for the party is Bi@@ den at the top .
at Clin@@ t tra@@ ilers say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far ahead of us .
the bi@@ ds decides not to can@@ v@@ end for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clin@@ ton lead will increase before S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ den in competitions at 30 points without him in the race .
five @-@ five percent of democratic voters face Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election ; however , this figure has declined from 78 per cent to the last month .
bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage of people who sel@@ ects it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; is increased .
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important in one candidate , democr@@ acies call on political voters regarding the constitu@@ ency .
similar to last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate to this vot@@ al candidate is considered unacceptable .
the Democratic candidates and potential candidates provide good results with some important feature on voters of the presidential elections of their party .
we look at the Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and with strong leadership .
Bi@@ den cuts among the three candidates most from honest , while Clin@@ ton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trusted , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 % ) , but 27 percent do not think of it .
democratic voters of the elections are generally Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologies in accordance with their views .
with all these measurements about a quarter of the democratic elec@@ torate has no opinion of S@@ anders .
as questions on Hill@@ ary Clin@@ ics will continue to use a personal email address and a server during the term as the Secretary of office , most of the Democratic vot@@ er voters are satisfied with their statement of the matter and say that their opinion has not been influenced by their opinions .
but it is a different story in the American public .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is content .
the public opinion of this was in March , shortly after the problem was light , split .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy did not affect their general opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion was worse from her .
there are mainly Re@@ public@@ ans , more than six of them who say their views of Clinton have become worse .
although Clinton is considered to be honest and trust@@ worthy of the voters of the voters in total : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not hold it for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time 55 percent of those entitled to vote do not see far more tru@@ mp than not honest and not trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp get good notes at management .
the six tested candidates cut Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best in honesty .
a majority regards as honest , but like with Car@@ son many have no opinion of it .
the fault ratio for the sample of 3@@ 51 of the constitu@@ ents in the pre @-@ elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son is moving close to Donald Tru@@ mp in the country of country .
Ben Car@@ son is part of the latest survey of CB@@ S News / New York Times close to Donald Tru@@ mp
at the two candidates the half of support for voters remains in the new survey , and others lose dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters support nationwide in large numbers . the support grows by 23 % in the last CB@@ S survey , which was conducted above Fox News debate last month , by 27 % in survey from Tuesday .
but Car@@ son took from 6 % at the same time from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son in demo@@ graphic groups can be well received and Tru@@ mp is sur@@ faced by Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , except for Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ die , is struck with Wis@@ cons@@ in Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen on deepest and that from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
the former Florida Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , the former Gover@@ nor of Ark@@ ans@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , with 6 % on the third place .
the error of errors in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week shows that Car@@ son rises in the surveys - he gains at 19 % support in the re@@ public@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp of 32 % support .
the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed tru@@ mp in front of Car@@ son .
with a view to one of the last week rising Car@@ son , Tru@@ mp found some side in@@ ers for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ olog@@ ised to ask Tru@@ mp@@ s faith into question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp in the past Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant swimming temperatures : the east@@ erly Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , for the seaside resort is already a trip to the Mediterranean to still find hot water .
a dip in north or Baltic is likely to be a rather short pleasure with a maximum of 17 degrees .
maneu@@ ver goes no more into the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week , it shares the German Weather Service ( D@@ W@@ D ) .
on the other hand , bath temperatures still offers the Mediterranean : in the East it is even up to 29 degrees .
the Adriatic Sea is located at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five Members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ no@@ vice
almost two years after a student in a student ritual in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , assass@@ ination was filed against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ PSI Brotherhood took &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g for a while in September 2013 and delayed his transportation to the hospital , resulting in his death , shared the police with .
officials said that he had been charged with related eyes with a 30 pound ru@@ cks@@ ack full of sand , and repe@@ ats , while he tried to go over a frozen field to a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g , finally , compl@@ ained about head@@ ache , then he fell unconscious around .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ PSI Brotherhood ran@@ ged not the emergency number 911 in , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and waited to an hour before they brought him to a hospital so the police .
they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , his symptoms of goo@@ gling and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to seek advice , he said boss Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point the members of the Brotherhood began to hide and asked the welfare of the Brotherhood fundamentally about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said police spokes@@ man .
he could not revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning at his wounds .
after a aut@@ op@@ tic , Den@@ g were repeated with mu@@ te force injury to head , trunk and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least a student dies every year on the ra@@ ils , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer , who represents D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accountable , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Monroe would be issued by a charge of murder on the third counts for the first five members .
two @-@ thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged for a criminal attack and formation of a criminal Association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the persons involved but if there is an organisation that has failed - officially or in@@ official - this will also be called to account &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Wagner on a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has forbidden the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood has rec@@ eded its adher@@ ence to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases the interest rates
a place of inser@@ tion comes , and the land@@ se will get out , ren@@ ders for bonds will increase , and the economy will slide into a recession .
this is what we know .
what we don &apos;t know is how long this will last and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy offers only little guidance on the procedure .
a recession came from only 11 months after the first interest rate and lasted 86 months .
the aggressi@@ veness of the Federal Reserve on lifting the interest rates is often , even though not always , a factor in the way the economy and financial investments respond .
hence , representatives of the U.S. bank so force@@ fully stressed that investors should not concentrate on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period that is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact several variables play a role .
in the end , market participants may notice that the whole excitement would possibly be exagger@@ ated because of a raise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is inevitably interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at too low levels so as to lead to se@@ is@@ mic shock , which many seem to fear .
however , this does not mean that there will be no effect .
here is a historic market based look at how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , it can make the anticip@@ ation of cement things for a while vol@@ ati@@ le .
as soon as the increase comes , the influence is not that dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is apparently a tendency to be p@@ ha@@ iled 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said German @-@ Bank an@@ alysts in a newer study to what is going on after inser@@ tions of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , the market is usually present in the warming level - about 14 per cent - on the way to the inser@@ tion cav@@ ity , rather flat in the 250 days after ( average profit of 2,@@ 6 percent ) , then back to standard analysis by 14.@@ 4 percent , according to a current analysis , the Bob Dol@@ l , Chief System @-@ Str@@ ate@@ ge at Nu@@ veen Asset Management , in Bar@@ ron &apos;s released .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on shares bi@@ ased out later in the increases cycle and returns the return to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic activity , but they often promote conflicts .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that could not exist before and that could accelerate a recession .
very remarkable is that the gross domestic product is located near his lowest point at a pin@@ point @-@ raising of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank at 118 months of competition since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP had only been rated by 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 rose by 3.@@ 6 percent , only few people expect this to last and expect the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed at only 1.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; comm@@ ent@@ ations of such fragile economic setting would be risky and throw the question to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is this time different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have taken up the whole year on a pre @-@ advertise of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the session of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many str@@ ates and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could have an increase in this session , the Fut@@ ures trading only shares a 25 percent chance .
&quot; in our study , all booster cycles have taken place in a super @-@ cycle with expon@@ ential boost in GDP , and on @-@ time rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ing summ@@ ed very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; says the report .
by contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what the worst recession in the observed phase was .
the current cycle is by far the longest , the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession , the record was 35 months and this has been 74 months so far .
the firm income was also vol@@ ati@@ le , since the market takes over a place of inser@@ tion , and the pattern is quite similar as in the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds will be faster than with shares , if that change its strategic course .
upon bonds , the ren@@ ders seem to be changed once the first raise should be cut into the cycle .
at the end of the booster , the bond @-@ participants falling immediately , told the Deutsche Bank .
the str@@ ate@@ gen of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in the rate of interest will result in bringing the ri@@ ots closer and shorter bonds and lead to a dra@@ ining of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ rate bonds often bring better yields , although &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed In@@ come an@@ alysts at Schw@@ ab , in an Analyse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
interesting is , says Jones , that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed Strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation , there are several indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stri@@ c@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the income chain is fl@@ atter and l@@ ump has increased - and the vol@@ ati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market , if the F@@ ed has intensified their strategy .
in large and throughout , businesses that get the greater part of their business activities in the United States will benefit , if interest rates increase and local products will become more attractive .
multination@@ als with high debts are going to be worse since the rising dollar is making their products on the global market more expensive and also financing their debt as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares may be extremely positive for three months after an initial tick @-@ raise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analy@@ st in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed on average by 5 percentage points after each of the traine@@ e in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
company with high capital ren@@ ditions as well as low vol@@ ati@@ lity in their shares , also met their counterparts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts are becoming a big problem .
companies with a high percentage of flexible interest rates will most lose , said Gold@@ man .
outside the pure share of equity , consumers will also profit from the rising Dollars .
savings could also see gains by higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are how fast that will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Executive Board Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative member of the Parliament critici@@ zed the transmitter for his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cur@@ v@@ ature &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly different from commercial ri@@ vals .
he was also involved at the BBC Music Awards and said that she was only The Br@@ its im@@ i@@ xed
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins got hold of the show The Voice and said that this is not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; to Classic FM , claiming a leading parliament and increases new pressure on the transmitter , to prove that he does not do what the private sen@@ ders do not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ atives Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the publicly @-@ legal radi@@ os@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; record &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly don &apos;t be distingu@@ ish@@ able from his commercial ri@@ vals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t want to trim the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was also involved at the BBC Music Awards held in recent December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started in the past year , The Br@@ its seems to be just under another name .
so , if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples that you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC @-@ Director pointed back the accus@@ ations and argued that the BBC Radio 3 respon@@ ds far ahead of its commercial ri@@ vals when it comes to live music and illumin@@ ating the public .
what I learn about Radio 3 , I will not learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the dedication of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works on behalf , I also really think for important &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Dav@@ ey shows that tough@@ er must be working harder to engage audiences , when it did so in the past , because the British are less informed about classical music .
radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production , which during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sport was put under fire , to step the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
the T@@ ory MP , Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins got hold of The Voice to - the musical talent show of the BBC , who was bought by Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for a valued cost of 22 million £ .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and is not especially distinctive ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George was produced as &quot; judges - &quot; on special BBC fashion . &quot;
he added , he also wish that the company &quot; take a hit from our in @-@ house barn , &quot; if it was the next time an am@@ usement program .
however , he refused to exclude the order from other rows of The Voice in the future or give money to other sub@@ missions for other sub@@ missions .
Internet sales went over in August at the slow@@ est and Black Friday .
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online selling .
last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to buy
experts believe that the Black Friday has slow@@ ed down the issue in November Friday .
for over a decade the virtual shopping basket has curved , and many of the main shopping streets in Britain have transformed themselves in gh@@ ost cities .
yet experts say that there are signs now that the online revenues will pass , after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the overall expenditure for August presented the lowest growth in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales will pass on , after new numbers show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , this has always developed over time , Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , Publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sales to the Guardian .
he explained that the online sales began three years ago , as buyer started to make use of their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could enjoy online and that people could do this in different environments such as at home on the sofa .
but now it com@@ mu@@ te that and we may possibly experience that growth reduces .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the subsequent ren@@ ders .
experts believe that buyers have held their purchases prior to this event , which is held on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers have turned their computers to make their bar@@ gain , and some traders @-@ sites rus@@ hed .
experts believe that Black Friday , where buyers have w@@ aged for bar@@ gains , buyers of which could prevent their purchases .
a study of British Retail Con@@ sortium was out of a period of 5 £ and more than one £ online .
with some products such as television and washing machines , more than a third of the purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of men buy clothes and shoes online instead of the fashion designers in the inner cities .

B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap European arti@@ sans is over
British are increasingly employ arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified Cra@@ fts@@ men from Eastern Europe has a rise behind them
this results in addition to that 200 other scre@@ w@@ fix stores , which aim to be opened at arti@@ sans
at the same time King@@ f@@ isher 60 B &amp; Q sales points will make nationwide
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef correspon@@ dent of Daily Mail
it is said that British are holding their h@@ amm@@ ers and brush in favor of the use of qualified East European craftsmen who carry out their works in their home .
if you can sk@@ ill@@ fully deal with a hammer or a brush to the anst@@ ed of walls , these are apparently apparent to a minority .
because British are increasingly losing tra@@ des@@ men to perform home@@ work jobs in their homes , as the leader of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new manager of King@@ f@@ isher who owns the Bau@@ Markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified professionals from Eastern Europe that offer services at low prices is now outdated .
therefore , King@@ f@@ isher , 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ fix Shops can be opened , which close to arti@@ sans and 60 points of sale from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q @-@ Shops , because eight out of ten buying decisions in the shop are taken by women .
in the moment they weigh in the employees the men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said it is necessary to face the growing demo@@ graphic trends that more Fem@@ ale Single @-@ households can make more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our stores .
we have to shift this more strongly towards a balance .
basically , half of our customers are made of women with 80 percent of the decisions concerning the purchase of articles through women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British at FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index and leading companies , has also changed their Top Team to reflect a equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ f@@ isher is almost the only company that occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and CFO .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ f@@ isher denoun@@ ced a decline in the half @-@ year gain and the revenues , after the group employed the cost of closing the stores .
because of the trend King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q has opened 200 new branches .

this fact differenti@@ ates the Chairman of the Sch@@ mitt@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , Ri@@ chter@@ ine Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
for the accus@@ ation of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence constitutes the fact that the association had not ar@@ isen out of the asset at no time .
the sports function@@ aries would have calculated only allow@@ ances and the sports@@ wear for whom they had been employed from 1982 to 2011 and in which they would have invested a lot of time and money to get out of debts - Pas@@ li@@ va prayed in 2001 around 600@@ ,000 Sh@@ illing ( about 4@@ 4,000 Euro ) .
&quot; then we were in front of the situation : do we lead the club further or do we im@@ prison ? &quot; , he was a accused , &quot; told an the accused , in the company &apos;s general manager of the financial officer .
and he decided to undertake this task with his colleagues and co @-@ accused .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have made money , our life insurance is held at the bank as security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in the acceptance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the association it has been agreed : you can manage the money free , there may only be no debts .
furthermore - with appropriate financial success the payout of allow@@ ances was adopted by 1991 until 1991 .
therefore , one portion of the allow@@ ances was only years later , since the year 2003 , when a plus was in the account , paid off .
so even l@@ ump and not detailed bookings , explained the former Ob@@ ower the processes .
the accounts and as@@ sion@@ ers accompanied the two def@@ endants together , said the second def@@ endant .
why the exp@@ ulsion of the association was not to be revealed in detail , the ri@@ chter@@ ine asked .
the association has not interest in detail for the financial intermedi@@ ation , which was important not only the debt of debt , so the answer .
as in 2011 against the official investigations into account of ministers , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the club account .
these were war@@ ms , explained the def@@ endants .
this type of reference was not well @-@ known on the name of the second def@@ endants and was not known according to the association &apos;s statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wanted the right to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after that the respon@@ dent did not answer a long time .
then he said , he believed that this is the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have been aware of this money , he placed the prosec@@ utor into the room .
the collaborators did not have been informed , ri@@ fied the functional .
this transfer was formulated as a &quot; damages &quot; .
why harm ? , wanted to know judgment and prosec@@ utor .
the first accused explained to him that he did not agree with this wording as the association had never occurred .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what can I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom you are all out of the hook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; he asked .
furthermore , the function@@ aries said he never related a c@@ ents content , he only reck@@ less o@@ dom@@ le money and di@@ ets .
to di@@ eting , he included the association $ 1,000 per month , but the actual effort has been much higher , but he added .
the accused did not identify exact documents for the early years .
these are after an operating examination , in which everything was judged properly and no more con@@ served , they declared .
o@@ dom@@ ed had also ordered the second def@@ endant .
all the containers are made in cash , and in addition he had to go from his residence international market to the bank of B@@ lei@@ burg , he declared in his statement .
the main proceedings at the ICC continued on 23 September with the ques@@ tioning of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard En@@ lar@@ ch more 30,000 jobs
in addition to for three years of current personnel building , the computer giant can dismant@@ le further jobs in developing the company .
the job car@@ esses near the US Computer H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) will not find an end .
as part of its restructuring , the U.S. technological company plans to reduce the dismantling of 25,000 to 30.000 positions in its corporate clients .
in this way , the cost of EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.8 billion euros ) shall be saved , divided the company on Tuesday .
the move will lead to a special rate of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will be incurred from the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years .
HP employed at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 still around 30@@ 2,000 employees .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : Non@@ violence in Serbian @-@ Russian border
the Hungarian police has been deployed on the Serbian border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ aces and Water lights for hundreds of hundreds of refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ ews @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has experienced the non@@ violence in the border inspection point .
he told the phone :
a group of refugees broke the border .
behind that , a police line had form@@ atted and behind the polic@@ emen stood a water @-@ light .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing with stones , sho@@ cks and plastic bottles after the officials .
the officials initially initiated an uninterrupted pe@@ pper spray .
afterwards the police used Tr@@ ac@@ eng@@ as .
many Tr@@ ac@@ eng@@ as was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
this was the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now re@@ dropped a little now .
a pregnant and apparently betra@@ yed woman was carried away out of the zone .

time of decision on interest rates for the US staff
the world observed , when the US trans@@ bank publishes on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , in order to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest rates are lifted or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists , who were asked about Re@@ uters found that a little more than half , the last week of view was that F@@ ed is still thinking of it , now that the F@@ ed will remain slightly longer and that interest rates will be kept at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historic event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest rates to NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero section and starts a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Angel U@@ bi@@ de , Gui@@ delines at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US economy is on a relatively good performance level , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generate just a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ genous view of global relationships .
it has warned the markets to rise to an increase , but signs point out that the odds against such a step are good .
the decision should be announced by 20 : 00 CET on Thursday
death guns at the Delta State University left no excuse to exc@@ uses
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the shot and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later killed his colleagues on the day and killed - Sh@@ annon was a note to say that he is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the first murder and wanted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave authorities on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said that Lamb , Lec@@ turer for geography and social education at the Delta State University , calling the emergency number against 10 : 00 am Monday morning .
and he said , he shot on someone and someone was killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the staff of the emergency central that the police must send polic@@ emen at his home . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said , &quot; I made my wife yesterday evening , and he also mentioned that a &apos; sweet dog &quot; in the house is , although &quot; nobody will inter@@ fere , &quot; but probably be excited .
the police asked the c@@ aller after his name , but he did not give him .
he has no explanation for his shots .
as police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice of Lamb , 45 which said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted it , I could und@@ o it .
I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the records from Lamb 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , before he finally took his own life on Monday night , as polic@@ eman sho@@ cked him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; universal President William La@@ For@@ ge said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he does not know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb was supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ um@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt said on Tuesday , there was &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; of a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said they were about seven years married , as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but were friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss have a daughter who is 19 and let them destroy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss did her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ un@@ ss worked online from home , according to statement by L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss have had a dog named Light@@ ning poss@@ essed to have been met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she wanted to always help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said they returned to a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he go not to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as polic@@ eman took him on highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in this night , I drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and sle@@ w himself with a kiss .
he was received at the spring of 2015 by the Delta State University a doctoral title , as relates to his lifestyle on the University &apos;s website .
stars who have lost their happiness
the A@@ ctor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years .
in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia and in 2009 he lost his many years of partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer .
the actor has alle@@ ge@@ dly reported to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was sentenced because of drug use .
all this certainly calls for its toll .
Euro@@ drawings : Lufthansa builds the Group

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can not play for double frac@@ ture over month
Luke Sha@@ w suffered from Manchester at the Champions League defeat from Manchester at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven dual carriage of his right B@@ one .
while this will have brought the left edge of the outer self and close it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not give up hope that Sha@@ w is going to play again this season .
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ ctor Moreno in the 15 minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was in the PS@@ V sector .
he was treated nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before being moved to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double B@@ einf@@ ra@@ ving and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will move tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operates in Manchester .
it is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it gets very difficult and then is fantastic , and then it happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mas@@ cot .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Moreno seemed happy to escape a red map and the suspension of a sl@@ ender .
Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , has not pen@@ alized the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian refer@@ ee was wrong .
you can judge for yourself if I say that a El@@ f@@ meter and a red card was due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a T@@ we@@ et to Sha@@ ws account : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come more and more . &quot;
there@@ on : Manchester United is suffering the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the defeat of the PS@@ V
the England def@@ ender has an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to take a rest until the next June .
Phillip Co@@ cu , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
if a player leaves this kind of injury the place , everyone is very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Moreno had a gal@@ en@@ ary when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult , because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear that it is a very bad injury , that is not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ cu . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was on the way in another direction , so that it looked like he &#91; Moreno &#93; touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with SB@@ 6 said Moreno : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be .
I feel very ill there . I am so sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to hospital - after a game of Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron know The Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not be long before you know it nearly upon your mind .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favorite pedi@@ gree book was asked , decided the prime minister for The Lor@@ ax , the 1971 syn@@ ced Environmental f@@ abel from Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writing Cameron in a message on the site of the company Super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; fun , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read my children , as it seems always to be an image or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except for the following paragraph , which Cameron alle@@ ge@@ dly describes the action of the book instead re@@ mit a summar@@ ies of the film version of 2012 , added the new characters and details to extend the fairly short original text .
&quot; surrounded by the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone , and even the air is a commodity , hopes to see a boy from Au@@ dre@@ y to meet the girl of his dreams , &quot; read it . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name The@@ odor Se@@ uss Tak@@ el lau@@ ded and the 1991 died , but completely unknown .
as if this was not yet suspici@@ ously enough : the pic@@ kl@@ ed text reads like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the w@@ alled city Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , hopes to win a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he adm@@ its , to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron wants the action of the book so little familiar . here is an un@@ named boy , like the local environment by the h@@ itting , Th@@ ought , a ho@@ ckey bit@@ ing being , &quot; which speaks &quot; &quot; &quot; in the name of the trees &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR function has been deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per , who has not read The Lor@@ ax every 20 times in a similar child .
a Down@@ ing Street speaker said that the text was probably drawn by Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s choices .
super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text by Cam@@ er@@ ons has been delivered , but there were no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s squ@@ ad , but it &apos;s still difficult
to encounter Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , is a difficult task , but if you chose the cad@@ res , which has chosen England for the tour , there is a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series of defeat not on my card .
I would not susp@@ end a down@@ fall .
A@@ reli@@ ance C@@ ooks page is possibly less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the batt@@ ing assembly , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not carry s@@ cars from 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een is developed as a spin Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on test plane , is an option for the attack .
in this news @-@ related news : Adam Ir@@ th separ@@ ates from the England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ alen .
the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th , of course , is for me as its chief trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyse .
with its seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that crime players are oriented to results .
there was no question mark on Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this , players will choose their very best selection .
a long time ago I would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own destiny .
if he hopefully suggests further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there is another chance .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss also praised his post@@ ure , even though he did not produce so good performances and this does not surprise me ; he is above all a team @-@ man .
the question , how much time a test perc@@ ei@@ ving gets to put his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - , while Nick Comp@@ ton was nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to do home and departure .
the only accus@@ ation that one can rise , was that England first issued Jonathan in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in peak - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a stroke I highly regard .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ ck@@ et@@ player who saw during Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he achieved 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
he must obtain at least the same chances as they receive before him , but it depends of course on the leadership position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to suggest mo@@ een aside Cook , which results in an extra @-@ spin Bow@@ ler and four Qu@@ eb@@ icks , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a stroke can not beat there , and this lef@@ tist @-@ handed has already shown that he is a devil @-@ cri@@ mp of cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een may not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate , Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played its first 38 tests on the first drop , before it appeared as Open@@ er 2001 .
he made us immediately and was not looking back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes to the Ka@@ der as back @-@ up sp@@ inner and in my limited company dealing with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people possibly see his statistics - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there &apos;s no large number of backup sp@@ ouses that lift their hands and the coaches have decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team England has made a few clever supplements available at the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ &apos;s , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a masterpiece .
he is one of the nicest guys of the game , who will bring an abundance of experiences since it has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Col@@ ling@@ wood is used for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use to the Setup .
I always felt that he is created for the international cri@@ cket contest , as a player or as coach , and as Mah@@ ela he got insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes , new voices can produce fresh wind in the locker room , even if the messages are in tune with the previously spoken .
Col@@ l@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ ok@@ es , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar rest against Australia and I have no problem with it .
some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team actors do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with the players are dependent on their jobs by the results .
such decisions are not made easy heart .
the Bre@@ xit Bre@@ xit ( Bre@@ xit = exit of Britain from the EU ) could gain allow@@ ance when the economy is in a leaf@@ y unit by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ treated novel strategy to hold the UK in the EU will come deeper into trouble with each day , even without the choice of the in@@ geni@@ ous Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it yes or no ? &quot; cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the Tu@@ c , which cr@@ ush@@ ed heavily on Tuesday on Tuesday .
foreigners have their cor@@ by@@ ists and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at and saying that some member states are deeply ent@@ an@@ gled across different crises , such as the EU is now and not always from their own debt , Great Britain itself confronted with conc@@ er@@ ted concessions and disturbing the changes they did not want to be s@@ ati@@ ated .
in Brigh@@ ton , the Tu@@ c decided on their annual meeting that they may not like this when they end@@ anger social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Ministers climb to summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say they can win allies for reforms .
it is always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend , who wants to look for an outside Britain in the inside of the EU meeting - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and lets go through that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials come up to the point where they no matter whether we remain or going . &quot; &quot; &quot;
German careful chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an association , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it is bad for her , as it has done for the exagger@@ ation long as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande can look at his re@@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a blin@@ ding force .
Poland has soon created a nation@@ alist &apos;s right government , Spain a left .
it falls hard to imagine that it will be a leg to help the sel@@ f@@ ie British to prevent their energy better for it , Scotland &apos;s ex@@ iting from the UK to prevent something they do not want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st trends have .
therefore , some such ministers may even pret@@ end do not helpful comment , totally in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s refer@@ en@@ sil@@ ently 2017 , to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process , susp@@ ect my boyfriend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ ego@@ ti@@ ation was a ple@@ ite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has won anything of its value from the ren@@ ego@@ ti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how r@@ ally the Fle@@ et Street can be at its expense and which EU scep@@ tics is the oligar@@ chy of the press bar@@ sto@@ ch@@ one , as they were inspired by Tony Ben@@ n inspir@@ ational speaker from 1975 yet , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .

actually Tony Bla@@ ir managed similarly over her , but realized that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you get better ban@@ anas distributed to di@@ stract him instead of having to become his lunch and dinner .
in fact , mili@@ tia was more bla@@ i@@ ri@@ ans as Bla@@ ir before he resist@@ ed Cam@@ er@@ ons refer@@ en@@ du@@ bel , because bla@@ e had refused its principle on the failed constitution which then opened by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened to it a back@@ door .
the press never promised him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me on Monday in Westminster a friendly cl@@ ap on the back - I told him that he no longer seems to waste a time for me - seems to repeat , N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cott Mur@@ doch strategy of 80 @-@ er years , an error at that time and today .
it can last but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa , he left on Sunday .
star@@ b@@ n is official position on Europe - I express it very friendly - in development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ ents and the wil@@ der poems by Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ism can probably say everyone to yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A ben@@ n , but no B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week said than the boy sc@@ outs in it did not admit that Cor@@ bi@@ onic appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea a bad idea .
it reminded me of the sev@@ enty years , when his old father was looking at his career , il@@ loyal to his Labour government , without going too far and to lose its cabinet .
Hil@@ ar@@ dy &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but to fight &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - B@@ enn@@ ing expressed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what J@@ C told his comrades and parliam@@ ent@@ arians after all reports on the Monday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what ever wants to convey the br@@ ittle bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n - remember that he even touched me - News discipline remains essential in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a brood @-@ care centre of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it is true to give Cameron any free card for Europe who allows him to keep lab@@ ours support in the refer@@ en@@ closing campaign for granted , like Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said it .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks that .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ bi@@ er &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ity of the EU membership - in accordance with its B@@ enn@@ ite Bel@@ ag@@ onal economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer merely a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dis@@ sid@@ ents , for which the Nar@@ c@@ issu@@ s of the small difference , is a central principle of dog@@ matic and disputes .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ity to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign for ex@@ iting - foreign diplom@@ ats will be required to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors .
why should Paris or Berlin have wast@@ ed political capital - they also have mis@@ sive voters - to make concessions to the British if this can be anything po@@ int@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction in the T@@ ory government on power , which was remin@@ is@@ cent of the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critici@@ ze report of Public Health England on e @-@ cigarettes
alleg@@ ations of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 persons , partially with connections to the tobacco industry , told researchers .
experts who write to the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) that joined the British Medical Journal ( P@@ he ) in her report on e @-@ cigarettes used to critici@@ ze .
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; primary report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but some researchers have put the ability of the data into question and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
a Gui@@ delines in the medical journal The Lanc@@ et last month took the &quot; exceptionally wind@@ y base &quot; on which putting his most important conclusion on the P@@ he .
two further researchers are writing in BM@@ J and have asked if the claims are based on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of Public Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical epidemi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based upon evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public anticip@@ ates that the claim that the claim is that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are approximately 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; on a detailed review of post @-@ wise and modeling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria of decision @-@ decision ( multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria / M@@ C@@ DA ) in order to lead to their opinions about the damage of various nicotine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose CEO was previously given by British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also underlined the references of BA@@ T for public health within a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting declared to receive funding from an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not the financing he intended to receive reports beforehand from the tobacco company Philip Morris International .
the reasons for selecting the members of the committee will not be supplied , but these include several popular e @-@ cigarettes @-@ champ@@ ions , some of which also provide a range of industries on the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting , the tobacco leadership took part again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; insi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damages to most products at most criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or limitations in the P@@ he report is discussed .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said the claims of P@@ he that &quot; there &apos;s so far no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes was used as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers .
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director for health and well @-@ being at P@@ he said that alleg@@ ations of BM@@ J was already responded to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
all evidence under@@ lie that health risks of e @-@ cigarettes compared with are low , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence does and what not , especially when there are so much public confusion about relative dangers in comparison to tobacco .
almost 80@@ ,000 people are killed every year on a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health system two billion £ per year .
because of the clear pr@@ un@@ ting of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not risk without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ en@@ ders , says former Chief of Channel 4
the former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should cease to send programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals &quot; their right arm would give &apos; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broad@@ casting fee should only be used to render the type of programs that are not sent through other UK stations .
he critici@@ zed the BBC tri@@ ght that they are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , put into tough over@@ run time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and of channels like BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC @-@ Director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had been trying to get in contact with Channel 4 for six years to get in touch with the BBC .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes were on mission or sends , which would also un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally showed clearly by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus @-@ communic@@ ations committee in the context of his investigation into the future of the BBC .
if you would like to keep the broad@@ casting fee , what I consider Central or long @-@ term does not work for a good idea , it should at least give its production on programs , others do not do or give them order .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class window , because they want to reach as much support as possible for their future .
the idea that otherwise no one would show it is a joke , it &apos;s ridic@@ ulous , it is natural nonsense .
Johnson said : &quot; I do not see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax schemes that could be financed without subsidies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ er@@ ders is another one with a given value both of self @-@ productions .
honestly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am supposed to see myself how this should be public @-@ legal television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t believe this would reduce the BBC ever .
Johnson , a Entrepren@@ eur for series , Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC blame for the hunt is &quot; because of the ambitions of those who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular ship@@ ments of the BBC broadcast again , what the former president of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ press conference held in Edinburgh in 2003 proposed that the BBC shows should sell as East@@ ders .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal N@@ ego@@ ic programmes were to go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , but they can &apos;t argue if they go to their virtual holy missions for the justification of 4 billion £ broad@@ casting , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them into a window , in which no one ever wanted to see them .
on broad@@ casting , Johnson said to the Committee , &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can obtain the best value .
of course , remember all , we think that you get a great value for 150 £ per year but for people who &apos;s a lot of money for the 150 £ a lot , I wonder if that &apos;s true , because they consume no much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 leader David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday did ask the BBC to check their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission , to educate and entertain &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said , just little of the BBC production would now officially classi@@ fy as education - he said that it would be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should change in &quot; inform , &quot; clari@@ fying and conver@@ se in &quot; the public @-@ legal channels of television in Australia and Canada . &quot;
on the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas such as those of Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of TV will be shown and with the commercial transm@@ itters to make everything available online .
&quot; son@@ o@@ er &quot; can control brain cells by sound @-@ waves
the video shows how the Nem@@ ato@@ ds can change the direction in the moment in which it will be radi@@ ated with sound impul@@ sion .
scientists have bre@@ d wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified nervous systems , which can be controlled by blan@@ ks of sound @-@ waves .
the tiny sni@@ gs change the direction in the moment in which they have been produced with sound impul@@ sion which are for the human hearing on high frequencies to be radi@@ ated .
the stim@@ uli work through the en@@ roll@@ ment of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are gene@@ tically modified to wear the membrane channels which respond to ultras@@ ound .
further on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said that wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure , called Son@@ o@@ er , where ultras@@ ound can be used to activate a series of brain , cardi@@ ac and muscle cells outside of the body .
S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the method of one day could replace the depths of the brain , a more invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
sh@@ ad@@ ul@@ ers generally react not to ultras@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani that they did it if they were surrounded by a liquid with microsc@@ op@@ ic bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , found out , reinforce the ultras@@ ound @-@ waves that penetrate it into the wor@@ ms .
the reinforced ultr@@ asonic @-@ waves function on structures that can be called both the TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ axis channels and can be found in the membran@@ es of some of the dig@@ nit@@ aries .
the sound @-@ waves make the opening of these i@@ onic channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultras@@ ound @-@ driven ne@@ mato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically modified the wor@@ ms , that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ ate TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels .
when ultras@@ ound is applied to the changed creatures , the waves are ampli@@ fied by micro@@ bl@@ acks and transmit them to the wor@@ ms , where they turn into the changed Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the process has some similarities with op@@ to@@ graphic , a ground@@ breaking tool , enabling the scientists to integrate and off neur@@ ons with stim@@ uli of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ ers could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that must be sent to an optical fiber to the required position in the brain , Ni@@ ed@@ ig@@ rate ultras@@ ound fabric can pass through and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the sk@@ ull .
&quot; we believe that with gen@@ et@@ therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the attached human neur@@ ons temporarily sus@@ cep@@ tible to the ultras@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; said K@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin manufacturing cells , he added .

eight golden rules for living in student homes
eleven years ago I moved as self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old in a student dormitory , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the tense smile which I have been angry - and on the numerous , long@@ standing complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the ins@@ cription in dor@@ ms ranges from slightly nerve @-@ wr@@ acking up to absolutely frigh@@ tening .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to tie : people tell you where you come , whether and where you have taken your Sabbath year , where you are standing in terms of cor@@ by@@ n and why you &apos;re honest , Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in the Ernst , guys , there is only a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - do not hesitate to contact us .
it distr@@ acts the conversation and helps you to find out the people that you like contrary to those with whom you would not speak , even if your eyelashes were on fire and these extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people leave .
the rooms of people often turn into beverages preferences , movie locations and municipal meeting places , but they also include the places where people tigh@@ ten and under@@ wear their under@@ wear .
related : do not remember the university with a relationship
intro@@ sp@@ ection is given a rough handling at the university .
their room should be a refuge , but many of the dormitory @-@ homes form a room @-@ to @-@ room @-@ temper@@ ed culture that can be friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship continues , but you have to go away so that I get the energy that I have used for inter@@ acting with you . &quot;
try to sense when a class@@ mate is exhausted from convi@@ vi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ ck .
A@@ pro@@ pos ank@@ le : do it .
a guy in my student houses had the idea that a not locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship closing by b@@ aking .
since you begin the university at the peak of the back man@@ ie , the mon@@ ot@@ le is in the doors of people to present themselves with a dish of brow@@ nies , less wei@@ rd as the welcome of the 1950 @-@ er years &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I have to baked you something . so , and now please smile , if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
home @-@ home goo@@ dies , is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obligated to entertain yourself and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
naturally , it depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
poor mixed cl@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat guide that people sleep asleep when you ank@@ le .
ir@@ res@@ al food is a common crime in student homes .
of course , the ho@@ of of chicken is a rob@@ ber@@ y , but is it the taking of a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check the with the actual owner .
the chances are good that they say to use themselves , even if they are inside the inside .
when someone ste@@ als your stuff , this is annoying , and you have my sympathy , but try to deal with that well @-@ balanced as my room@@ mate , that she added a r@@ ins@@ ant to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
you should not make noise , the people from sleep or work .
it is not only about being a decent human being , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb to the people who sit in the Glass House .
a girl in my hallway asked her neighbors , whether it makes them something special , Drum or bass a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
you re@@ acted to this with still lou@@ der music .
when they finally stopped at 5 am , they left their neighbors to sleep two hours before they left their own music , shut their door shut and went on to its three @-@ hour examination .
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would random@@ ly enter into the same student dormitory ?
on the other hand , it would not be dis@@ coura@@ ge@@ dly embarrass@@ ed if you keep a room@@ mate for your future wife , going to them again , and then experience it every day and perhaps experience how all of our common friends emig@@ rated ?
of course , the heart goes its own paths - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future wife , try at least to talk to your abdom@@ en .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his key in his not locked room has let you lie , the boundary between a VO@@ k and bullying are , than it seems .

thousands of refugees are pushing for housing .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes to know how quickly affordable housing is made : it builds in a project terr@@ aced houses for refugees .
Mr. G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees will be pushing for the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : mass transit in containers or gymn@@ asium has no sustainability .
for people remain a big part here .
in the face of the refugee @-@ flow we need enough living space in the next decades .
a quite different , three @-@ stor@@ eyed house @-@ house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a home @-@ house needs least place .
it makes it easier to integrate .
this is different when you under@@ pin the people in blocks .
each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three dwell@@ ings each with four asylum seekers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees shall say , it is peace , I go back .
then the houses can easily be changed to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house rises to 184 000 Euro , without land .
this is quite man@@ age@@ able .
during six months the construction of the construction will take place .
this is reasonable .
have the construction rules their plans complicated ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : how legally have I dra@@ gged my project correctly .
particularly complicated , it always makes the dro@@ h@@ end D@@ amo@@ kl@@ es@@ worth Special and the slot regulation .

it is still under@@ lining those who creates three apartments in one housing of three apartments , needs at least three pitches .
only in cities is missing the place .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the inhabitants react to their maturity project ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there were those who have accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
what definitely is not right .
but tigh@@ ten you not competitive the competition for affordable housing ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : true : in the last five years we have a building boom in Germany , but built luxury apartments , which can hardly afford a more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need housing .
not only refugees but also the only mother or the Ger@@ mann@@ ers .
I am showing how to build good and well even today .
that is why it goes .

iOS 9 : how you can get the new iPhone operating system if Apple update will be published
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by typ@@ ing in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software @-@ Update . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some have come to problems after installation , as they get an error message , the mitt@@ als that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to handle the issue , users is recommended to either wait until the rush goes back or trying to update on iTunes .
the phone itself takes you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the del@@ eting of apps to create space - but Apple has done this through the merging of the update . likewise , it will be easier to do this when you work a special tool , to delete apps and then restart it as soon as the process is complete .
it &apos;s worth to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during an upgrade or is located near a charger , so that the battery is loaded .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued since the telephone may possibly be deduc@@ ted between half way and this could result in a demo@@ lition of updates .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice Fel@@ ting and inv@@ ests in 3@@ 10000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ as and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen .
in addition , Sam@@ t@@ onal fav@@ ors Bernd Bor@@ mann , econom@@ ists in Uta Sei@@ m @-@ Sch@@ wart@@ z and As@@ endor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert .
in many places in the countryside there are lack of doctors - As@@ endorf on the other hand , Dr. Frank Müller served the practice in Fel@@ lowship with Frank Müller on October 1 .
while Ur@@ sel Fe@@ th@@ ausen goes into the retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is standing in half a spot to its successor in the next months .
after an expansion phase , Müller presents the practice on 12 October , until then he invested some 10,000 euros into the premises at the St.@@ -@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 .
it was great sympathy at first sight over the years ago Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ as met , who currently took care of their professional role in the supplier and wants to enter into practice after year .
&quot; we always had in mind that the gar@@ bage would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen and laughs .
&quot; when it was so , I have just ph@@ oned it . &quot;
the couple of Müller liked the idea to pursue their own practice in the future in As@@ endorf .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; we would like to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage he can see to be soon his own boss .
and so one was unanim@@ ous , the gar@@ bage dump the house with the practice .
they will continue living in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there is the second @-@ fold family father Frank Müller also grown , his Medi@@ z@@ inst@@ udi@@ um in Hannover followed stations in several medical offices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he currently works as a leader in Sul@@ ingen , and he was appointed to the senior p@@ endant in Di@@ ep@@ wood in 2009 and is committed to volunteer in the DR@@ K readiness of Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the practice for the new boss will be prepared from the 19th of September .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ste@@ ausen works as a car@@ rist , his wife has specialised in the gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the gar@@ bage , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to be based as a super@@ visor .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out therefore , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year , Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ as .
after conversion the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultras@@ ound examinations as well as long @-@ term and pay@@ load @-@ related companies .
furthermore the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a grant from a total of 50@@ 000 € receive the gar@@ bage within the framework of a conveyor programme ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; this shows how proud and glad we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; stressed Sam@@ t@@ onal po@@ th@@ ier Bernd Bor@@ mann .
about 2000 patients come to the practice Fel@@ ste@@ el@@ ausen , in the North German A@@ xis of approximately 500 patients , according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ as .
in As@@ endorf it is still another home @-@ office .
a positive side effect of the practical effect of the practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains the Ur@@ sel Mountains in As@@ endorf .
if no successor had found it , it would have gone .
who visited the Expert Consult@@ ation , although incidentally , continues to be in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical colleges and the cleaning power of the rim ) .
with their f@@ arewell in As@@ endorf their era ends , after all the medical doctors have been practi@@ sed there for 30 years .
&quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reminds on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; jungle &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a little sad@@ ness pu@@ ce it after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and you will certainly see many patients &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Intern@@ ist &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; your husband adds l@@ ach@@ ingly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up until now I have always pushed myself in gardening , now it could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
additionally , the pair has two grand@@ sons and travels gladly .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees by &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls will also be driven to our south border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior ruler of Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the checks at the Hungarian border are in parallel uph@@ eld .
still , it is clear that everyone who wants to make a asylum application , that can also be &quot; natural . &quot;
the supply and safety of the people is at the forefront .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also clear that there needs clear signals &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Prime Minister said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that without boundaries of migration flows , do not accept , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia contempl@@ ates &quot; corri@@ dor &quot; - Slovenia rejected
the Croatian government had previously told you to also leave Slovenia &apos;s coming refugees to Austria and Germany and to build corri@@ dors for the refugees .
thus this mini@@ stered in Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ man Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach however did not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of corri@@ dors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely inakzeptabel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia is going to intensify the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already heavily controlled by the external border of the shaft .
like the Prime Minister stressed , Sloven@@ e will not release his borders to refugees .
&quot; each member of the EU member must fill its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; emphas@@ ised Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar .
as the Croatian government communicated , the first refugees would have been trying to leave the night before the night before trying to go over to the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d , to avoid the registration .
the Croatian police could open them in the nearby Ma@@ is@@ ks .
according to local media since the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik constantly meet police vehicles with new refugees .
it is mainly about the Syrian and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
also rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days its land with some 4,000 refugees , Interior Minister of Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , buses from Pres@@ ses to the Maced@@ onian border that have so far been led to the Hungarian border to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the government in Belgrade denied that it is to make people put in references to certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we do , nor will we do it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media report certainly in the morning a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Ser@@ b border city Si@@ d , during the day , further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the in@@ mates were the whole night out of that of the approximately 500 kilometres distant ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has made , so the police told us that we are to go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you wanted to travel to Germany by Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
in this way , it could actually come to a slightly farther @-@ predicted shift in Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Macedonia @-@ Hungary to a slightly farther @-@ western route .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior ministers O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had stressed that his country has prepared corresponding plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call it but pointed out that Croatia made extensive options for border control as a non @-@ Schengen member . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we carry out strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have since consistently introduced a good witness to the country , which concerns the standard of border controls .
on ser@@ b@@ ischer site lies behind the Hungarian border fence there will continue to be about 300 refugees .
according to Bel@@ gra@@ der Media report they would have spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , who leads on R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities the two border transi@@ tions of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g continue to be completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border are still unclear .
the Serbian interior ministers N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried his fellow early in a local head@@ appearance in Hor@@ ego even at ease : he kept the debates on the alternate routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for being premature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not currently be a matter of very high refugee code . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is impossible to tell if they would continue their journey across Hungary , Croatia or any other country .
hel@@ pers recommend migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugees shel@@ ters have already begun to distribute the refugees to the refugees on which alternative routes are marked through Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in parts of the border area , there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian national park still not more spacious min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police declared that a team of min@@ e@@ ders was sent in the border region .
agate @-@ ackers : Ukrainian people pay 30 million dollars

with the exploited information , insi@@ der trading on financial markets have been made .
in this way , the investig@@ ators became a total of over 100 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current comparison shows that even those outside of our country borders are ultimately caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in the S@@ EC communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;

most of the def@@ endants come from Ukraine and Georgia .

F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , Fin@@ anz prospects for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ mis@@ sive results for the final quarter , and the delivery @-@ gi@@ ant lo@@ wered his prize @-@ looking at a whole year because of the weaker demand for cargo services and higher costs in its bo@@ at@@ ability service .
the company also said that she is planning a 5@@ 5,000 mark for the holiday .
at this stage last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to adapt the 50,000 win for holiday season .
the share fell more than 2.5 per cent in the pre@@ market , 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit of 10,@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year that ends in the next May , 20 cent less than with the earlier predi@@ ction .
analy@@ st expected according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower view comes in spite of the price increase , which will amount to 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on the 4th of January , despite higher inf@@ all for Bod@@ dens of heavy and large packages that will be raised from November .
the company said it nevertheless pro@@ visi@@ bly expect the result compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher earnings and because of growth in the online trade .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company brings &quot; solid ground@@ ings if you consider the weaker than expected economic conditions , particularly in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
the plans for the holiday @-@ employment became announced one day later than those of the Rival U@@ PS , which is planning to stop 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional labor force , about the same number as last year .
in the quarter that ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex has earned $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
the earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of the Investment Research and asked an@@ alysts predicted .
sales rose by 5 percent to 12,@@ 3 billion euros .
six of the tracks asked an@@ alysts anticipated 12.@@ 23 billion $ .
during the last few years F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international sales shipment , which brought sales to his unit express @-@ disp@@ ens@@ ation .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit posted higher earnings due to higher prices , while the result sank after higher labour costs in the freight @-@ shop .
in pre@@ market trade , about one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares form 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday they joined 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high@@ s high on June 11th .
at their most expected meeting in the year Federal Reserve Str@@ ate@@ gen spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ walk Honduras @-@ Mah@@ ag@@ oni @-@ table , to decide whether it &apos;s time for the first time since almost a decade to lift the benchmark interest .
dro@@ w@@ ls on them at the end of the fixed , two @-@ stor@@ eyed sitting room , is a mur@@ als of the United States .
the map is a reminder that F@@ ed @-@ Chair Jan@@ et L. Y@@ et and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a dual order from Congress : maxim@@ izing the US employment and prices here stable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since the big recession , the F@@ ed leader has recognised that there is an un@@ written third @-@ country mandate : financial stability . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too tight to predi@@ ct them . it is announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be approved by the unprecedented privileges due to the short @-@ term low @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it grows solid , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets increase the pre @-@ cau@@ tious F@@ ed @-@ representatives to increase this vol@@ ati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for Federal President , and be it only about one quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously the labour market and inflation in the first instance will be the most important thing they observe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ists in the Mak@@ ler@@ company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pretext to increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market has enough justification , keep on waiting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which secur@@ es the financial market in itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists reported recently by Bloomberg , have predicted a sign @-@ raising this week .
the financial markets , however , expect a lowering of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator which shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this points to a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the set , unless the strateg@@ ist hit the blow , by promising that further increase is far away .
on Tuesday the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average value increased by 22@@ 8.@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16.@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the promotion was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed policy considers the sentence in this week , &quot; said John Lon@@ ski , Princip@@ al Con@@ om with M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the propositions at that time , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if they do it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they had to go very far in their declaration in order to re@@ assure the financial markets so that they do not panic into panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts ar@@ gues that a tw@@ inning would re@@ assure the financial markets , because it would eliminate in@@ security about when the F@@ ed would be acting , eliminate .
still a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase in good paths to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percent@@ ages this month , the first small step in a slow shar@@ pen@@ ing of the mon@@ astic conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ella had said in spring and early summer , that in spite of the complaints from the liber@@ als , it would require more economic progress , an increase in the proposition .
although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , the improvement in the labour market in this year was solid .
the unemployment rate sank to 5.4 % in the past month , the lowest for over seven years and in the vicinity of the level , which sees the F@@ ed as full employment .
pay gains have shown signs of a recovery .
and although the inflation led continuously under the annual goal of 2 % of the central bank , F@@ ed @-@ representatives said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , Chief Executive Officer at the Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets were gathered in the whole world at the end of last month , after China has de@@ valu@@ ated its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average value fell in May by more than 16 % under his peak , as investors feared that slow@@ ing of the Chinese economy would provo@@ ke global growth .
the market has recovered a little this month , whereas the D@@ ow is now about 10 % below the high of May .
for the F@@ ed @-@ representatives the market impacts influence the complex calculation , when to increase the interest rates .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred during the last few weeks , Stephen said , A@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low on U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US staff .
now he says that she will be waiting at least a month to get the impact better in the grip .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the effects on the U.S. economy , and there are almost no reliable data , which describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the overall health of the world economy is none of the main ones of the F@@ ed , so they should not be involved in their decision making .
but in the end it has become the F@@ ed Monetary authority of the world .
the central bank of the Central Bank has been huge in recent years .
the mere note of the then director Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could gain its monetary expansion &quot; weak@@ ened &quot; , pun@@ ched confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ woven , the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives will be expected not only to monitor the developments in other countries , but also with other central banks and experts to maintain a better understanding of global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art as science &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the global strategy for asset management of &quot; En@@ er@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey l@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month , that &quot; F@@ ed has a history of over@@ re@@ action on financial market movements that are apparently not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
l@@ acker , compl@@ ain@@ ant Member of the Federal Open Market Committee , committed to a inser@@ tion cav@@ ity , calculated decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its benchmark interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percent@@ ages in three sessions &quot; despite limited dis@@ cer@@ ni@@ ble effects on growth in the U.S. , &quot; said l@@ acker .
one year later , the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives were und@@ o these cuts .
the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis like the First World of May 2008 , Adam S. Poznań , former member of the Committee on the interest rate of the Bank of England .
the latest turbul@@ ence do not come close to this level , he said .
&quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation where they are afraid of a sign @-@ raise , because markets dramatic , &quot; says Poznań , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act still contains double mandate and it is not mentioned the financial stability , and until this is changed , I don &apos;t believe they should be expected to hurry .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small life assistance for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
wishing you a warm welcome , not without the engagement of innumerable volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are quite a number of people supporting non @-@ selfish asylum seekers in the city .
these include Petra and Klaus Heine .
Petra Heine is with body and soul teacher .
even with their 74 L@@ enzen they still teaches .
every Thursday she is doing it in the asylum seek@@ er at the D@@ ill@@ inger Street .
there they help refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language .
of course , this is quite different classes than at the right school .
Brazilian Association Rio Grande promotes food for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS tried to clear up how important good nutrition is during the l@@ ac@@ tation period . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies which su@@ gar@@ s on cr@@ ushing which are painted with portra@@ y@@ als of healthy foods .
mother &apos;s milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers fall to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results suggest that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ ete@@ tic adjustment so that the mothers should carry .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet multip@@ lier women actually protects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ors .
unfortunately , a healthy diet of the child can affect the immune system neg@@ atively .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ese sports hall
the community of Bern@@ ried approved the construction contract for the 2.3 million Euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the plans for the long @-@ sigh@@ ted turn@@ around on the Bern@@ ese sports area became step by step : in the recent community council session , the designed building contract has been embr@@ acing without great discussions .
previously , the panel had such a request for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; respect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of valid development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form in terms of the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the plan a &quot; saddle @-@ roof &quot; with non @-@ mit@@ re first and roof @-@ over@@ stood can be established .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the background of the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar generators : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is how we get a wonderfully large southern African together , &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; again , in turn , pushed the roof of energy for energy reasons - otherwise than in the development plan for less than ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the volume of the hall is reduced considerably .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan for the roof of the bad@@ ge does not allow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; whereby the am@@ ber ran@@ der generally leaves more restri@@ c@@ tively in the rule of liber@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is not a recur@@ rent project at the turn@@ around project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ eigen@@ berger &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym at the sports centre is a common project of the municipality and the SV Bern@@ ried .
at the cost of some 2,@@ 3 million euros are calculated .
supplements are expected by the school and staff promotion .
in the next procedure , the construction contract for the 18 x 36 metres wide hall is now submitted to the landing office for the examination .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moved to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the Hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is planned to be closed before as planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes new doctor Director at the Hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of the staff are drawn by P@@ lei@@ ßen@@ berg along with Sch@@ ong@@ au .
these are the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the district court , the land@@ lady Andrea Jo@@ chner @-@ White ;
a decision on this is the Supervisory Board , and the Supervisory Board passed on Wednesday , 23 September .
should the plans be put into action , all of the just 50 employees will continue to be involved in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg all the nearly 50 employees .
the vast majority of sol@@ ves with fishermen and the further existing inside of the Z@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms may be present .
the associates who do not work with to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a job in W@@ eil@@ heim , so Jo@@ chner @-@ White .
the employees are informed about the plans .
it has triggered the cancellation of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the beginning of the beginning of the Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic and now transferred to a private practice close to the hospital .
on the question , who is to take the follow @-@ up , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play according to Jo@@ chner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; to take over the guidance and exchange with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this is in each case a &quot; appreciation &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the field of &quot; Sof@@ ie Medicine , &quot; as Jo@@ chner @-@ White .
Fischer is a specialist for heart@@ worm and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialised on the interior station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ologic illnesses .
the intention for the next two years is to agree with his team when the Supervisory Board agrees to give both houses , until then within the next year the former hospital of the tu@@ b@@ um has over 35 beds , has finally to be closed down in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after nearly 140 years .
until now , the rural district had planned this for 2018 , if the current restructuring in the hospital was completed by W@@ eil@@ heim .
Land@@ s@@ lan@@ tin Jo@@ chner @-@ White , which is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , rum@@ ours came forward , after which the house , which is owned by the Federal Government , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I close it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the real estate , Jo@@ chner @-@ White could not say there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a day@@ trips .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has not happened to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fischer over the Qu@@ asi &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; received positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where fishermen have been working as a boss for more than 30 years , did not give it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleague , taking over the post of the medical director .
the Hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was constantly under threat over the past decades , such as the surgery and the obst@@ et@@ rics .
the hand @-@ hand of the Rhine @-@ N@@ eck@@ ar lion is now called on the evening ( 20.@@ 15 pm ) at the Berg@@ ische HC .
the championship leader of the Bundesliga in Wuppertal is that the clear favorite , cause for arro@@ gan@@ ce , however , does not exist .
in the past season the Bad@@ ener met a painless defeat at B@@ HC and had a good reputation there .
Jag@@ ev@@ ous with two closures at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers are seriously in@@ ju@@ red during their cor@@ ps on the Tuesday afternoon by shots .
during the emergence of a corn on a corn field at Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) several hunters and hun@@ ts in action as the police took .
after a folding , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year old man suffered severe injury and were put into hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident at first was unclear .
the C@@ ID was established .
mixed 16 @-@ year @-@ old of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pf@@ alz victims of violence @-@ breaking
a scene of Tat@@ ry has led the police to the ser@@ che of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
in the trial , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old were killed , the young people killed and their corp@@ ses were thrown into a channel in rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
one since Saturday I missed 16 @-@ year @-@ old of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate is a non@@ violence to the victim .
the mother of the young lady was found at the Saturday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen in Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , like prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police on Wednesday were left .
as a tat@@ too , one also takes place on the Saturday evening of 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who was indeed imp@@ ed@@ ged the indication and investig@@ ates the investig@@ ators for the discovery site of the corp@@ se .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was missed on Sunday mor@@ nings after they did not miss the night after a visit to a autumn ceremony in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in search of the young lady , the investig@@ ator was first drawn to personal objects of the victim .
when surveys in the midst of friends and acquaint@@ ances of the mixed , finally , the scene finally yiel@@ ded a suspici@@ on of the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the mut@@ in@@ ely k@@ iller then led the police to a channel in rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the corp@@ se was found .
the for@@ bi@@ ased government was therefore killed in the police , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and the bodies were put into the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to be presented on Wednesday at the o@@ e@@ er , the investig@@ ators put him hom@@ icide to the burden .
indication of the immediate circumstances of action should bring further investigations .
refugees need accommodation : study war@@ ns in front of the gap
the situation in the German housing market is tense .
also more and more refugees are looking for a fare .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction is faced with a challenge .
the distribution @-@ competitions in the German housing market have long since started .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the upcoming refugees and job seekers from the EU more and more people push for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you compete with income @-@ minded citizens to the last affordable housing .
in order to cover the demand for affordable housing , it would have to be built up to 400@@ ,000 new units by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this result is a study commissioned by the Commission &apos;s mission of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison : this year , the amount of 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany .
this now missing 140@@ ,000 apartments .
refugees are no longer obligated for the first three months of their stay as asylum seekers in an initial court of accommodation .
many then come across the apartment and go into the long sn@@ akes in front of the flats .
according to statistical Federal Chancell@@ ery , however , less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent .
the negative development of the apartment market is however not only to the increasing refugees .
the study also makes substantial om@@ is@@ sions in the policy construction of the last few years .
Germany has a flat deficit that gets bigger from year to year .
at present , in the metropolitan areas there have been around 77@@ ,000 housing units , lam@@ ents Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many occupational activities therefore stayed in large cities of not@@ aries in WG @-@ rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults remained un@@ conditioned at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square meters per head has declined in the first years for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a new beginnings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this process , new incentives is supposed to boost social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this could be disp@@ ens@@ ed on the basis tax and the base tax for funded housing will be exposed .
moreover , according to the Coalition attractive tax rate possibilities are needed .
the support programme for refugee income of the Swiss bank Kf@@ W is now well accepted in towns and municipalities .
a good week after the launch of 184 million euros , the amount of around 300 million euros has already been launched on Monday evening .
now the project could even be extended .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia are corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary is virtually no longer a way of coming , as you choose more and more refugees crossing the road over Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb An@@ no@@ un@@ ces to give the passage of Slovenia to North without hur@@ d@@ les .
dangerous is the route but still .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country over the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I have spoken to the Sloven@@ ian Interior Minister , and when it is necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian interior of Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is still not a Schengen land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the de@@ preci@@ ation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees after Croatia broken down , to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people have come across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian TV @-@ channel RT@@ L .
Hungary had sealed its border to refugees on the eve of the day .
new laws , which entered into force on the same day , they do practically need@@ less superf@@ lu@@ ous .
Croatia wants to make the refugees happen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian prime minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and want to achieve something .
but it is people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police took the first refugees at the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia .
most recent media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
you arrived either by bus as well as taxi speakers to the Serbian border city of Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival , they had been trying to walk across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees no longer encounter the border .
for this the threshold number has other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v Civil War in the 1990s .
min@@ e@@ stri@@ ps now aims to create a safe passage .
after the closing of the border , there are hardly any more refugees after the closing of the border .
on Tuesday the police were 3@@ 66 fierce men .
just before Tor@@ p on Monday it was still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws put pressure in overcoming and damage to the bor@@ der@@ ment as a crime .
the following 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the South @-@ Hungarian border city of Sz@@ eged .
the condemned rep@@ lied forces up to five years and the de@@ portation from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the immigration authority I have taken in the new &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tran@@ seated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday in the new &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tran@@ sit@@ ons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of almost all - 93 - the most important transition of Kos@@ zal@@ z@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot;
amongst the applicants are 13 families with small children as well as two elderly .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees stopped there .
but virtually no one has a view to get granted in Hungary asylum .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guard zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke they were gathered only a few hundred refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to fit together .
it collected the rub@@ b@@ ish , the t@@ enth@@ s of thousands of people left over the streets in the streets .
ply@@ wood has been demol@@ ished and one of the records in the bor@@ der@@ land was changed .
to the aim of this change , nobody wanted to express themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Austria will only reach a few refugees after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
around 20,000 migrants were left to government offices but still in the country .
in Salzburg approximately 1400 people are waiting for driving to Germany .
the traffic traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning by the German authorities .
in liberty we met small groups of refugees on foot .
Mayor of the &quot; rack &quot; at the border
&quot; we were looking after the bridge on Sunday with the inter@@ iors , when suddenly ten people were standing with rice @-@ off@@ s at the entrance of the celebration , &quot; says Wern@@ stein Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler .
tourists , they wanted by train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany had a surprisingly busy rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee @-@ stro@@ kes with Austria was for it in Wern@@ stein ate , &quot; it was immediately possible to put his help and got the rocks together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Nah@@ e Pass@@ au .
before , we only shortened the un@@ hoped guests with J@@ ak and drink .
we said immediately , we drive them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; that was for us naturally , &quot; such city tour at O@@ Ö@@ N interview .
they were very grateful .
a man did not let him take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire@@ men .
&quot; we were very happy , &quot; says the city .
the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were gone on Sunday evenings in Wels from one ICE in a regional direction to Pass@@ au in order to pro@@ secu@@ te it after the short term pro@@ clamation that the railway traffic to Germany was stopped but still on the border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the regional train , however , was placed in front of the border in Wern@@ stein am Inn .
in Wern@@ stein , the cross @-@ border is generally highly in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bav@@ arian neighbours around on Sunday , Mon@@ days ago became sporty - organized by the union Wern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sent further toes to us now , is a logical result of a seem@@ ing policy :
rather than in the Camp R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke to help with the establishment of structures that guarantee humanity , our Federal Chancellor hosted us officially and publicly the position of the Hungarian government in the district of the National Socialism .
unfortunately , such policies are not only those Austrian who are now facing in the border areas with chaotic states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees also have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; landed country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she invited and welcome , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great challenge , given the continuing refugee streams and of the coming winter , with decent conditions for protection seeking protection .
and there will be one even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 3@@ 5000
finally , the hands of the refugee commission has full hands to do with the protection of refugees .
Christian Konrad is used to say that his word is weight .
the government has deployed the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen ban@@ kers to clean@@ se quot@@ as for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the initial investment center Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already been able to get a grip on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless people in Tr@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported about his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the lodging of 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday cannot be passed on Monday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand the Ministry of State spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scratch @-@ correct situation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
altogether , Konrad with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 Qu@@ arti@@ s in the he@@ ur@@ istic year .
in order to meet the number , over the next few weeks have to be found 3@@ 5.000 accommodation - 20,000 should provide the countries , 15@@ ,000 of the Bund .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a bott@@ om@@ less pit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already participated in talks with the local people .
they could have promised him , even for the coming refugees to create qui@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria it works well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP -@@ t@@ atar was supported by Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Card@@ inal Christoph Schön@@ born and will be clari@@ fied as the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; high expectations of the Asyl@@ um Coordinator in the OR@@ F promotion are also available in the OR@@ F action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , individuals are uncomplicated and uncomplicated accommodations .
besides , there is a lot of hopes for hotels that are empty during winter time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er critici@@ zed yesterday the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in emergen@@ cies , it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ ll@@ ers must respect a certain amount of the to@@ wel @-@ holder or size of the so@@ ber .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period of time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emer@@ gency &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that in contrast to the ministry of the ministry he was successful with his experience , was justified by his experience .
I am an older gentle@@ man , who one cannot tell without the face the im@@ percep@@ tible .
persu@@ asi@@ veness is its most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er the Republic do not cause the costs , as they declared themselves .
their number of employees want to extend it to three to four .
your own quest search has not been successful yet .
finally wanted a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz in office as an office .
but there are apparently problems with the permit .
Linz calls for better distribution
only the opening of urban sports halls and other buildings like tips @-@ Arena and design center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz .
at present , this is not necessary , as people are currently able to accomo@@ date without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
but for the emergen@@ cies , more locations should be tested for their fitness .
he is committed to the chief executive committee of the distribution of refugees inside the federal state .
other areas must contribute to their contribution .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; limits are not sealed . &quot;
in a longer call with the Bav@@ arian Prime Minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) , President Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( SD@@ U ) commissioned the further proceedings in the refugee deal .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer assured me that the German borders are not sealed .
the continuing integration of refugees into the Federal Republic of Germany continues to be possible .
however , there is now even the corresponding border controls .
there will be no more special lifts with refugees after Germany .
however , the protective participants would however return to Germany with regular journeys to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that now Austria has led to its borders again , is a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Wor@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; company at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Wor@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the stock @-@ operated IT @-@ Group S &amp; T , the rest ( 2@@ 700 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT are the wise heads of our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Dut@@ ch@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine , invest in start@@ up companies of the New Wor@@ ft and later re@@ inv@@ ests which to act .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; D wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - where &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
€ 1,@@ 7 million were invested at the location of S &amp; T into the plant , 3.@@ 3 million euros from the Tech@@ center , which is one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is surrounded by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and the Tech@@ center .
30 percent of the 2@@ 700 square meter in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent give it requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second business in the arc@@ ades
in the new shop Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags are in the center .
actually , Jutta enjoys a dog and wanted to set up a dog .
this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ arc@@ ade . finally , it has now gained growth in the form of another business loc@@ ales .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ shop opposite the business , in which they sold inter alia bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and spices of various manufacturers are now all about the hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , pur@@ ses are available from 75 Euro .
bigger pockets and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
since yesterday the new shop is in use .
previously , several weeks have been changed .
&quot; I have long over@@ looked , if I want to open a store , &quot; says broad .
decisive for deciding was among others that also the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna from the idea of an independent location where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; we are the mer@@ ciful in the Greater Region of Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has even Italian roots .
her fashion interest has been wide enough by her mother in the cradle .
I de@@ af the most when something develops and I can show new trends at high prices .
why so some woman with the sight of a beautiful pur@@ se with duty frame , can also answer the wife not with last safety .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag adds to every out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ al@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are named An@@ ders .
this property also links some with the billi@@ on@@ aire , the US president will be .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for exciting good .
whether it is expressed in xen@@ opho@@ bia , journalists or knowledge of scientists in the international crisis policy - the applicant for the U.S. presidential system whir@@ led the election campaign .
and cuts well off him .
this is also registered in the P@@ äl@@ z@@ an K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate of tremendous quantity .
the New Yorker with the bou@@ il@@ ante is a concept for many in the Win@@ zer@@ land Road .
man@@ cher in the 1200 @-@ resident place is about -@@ dirty corners with it related .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in der Pf@@ alz : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in the constitu@@ tive mode .
the K@@ all@@ city council Simone Wen@@ del made a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do vill@@ agers think about their aim to become the mighty man in the world ?
&quot; I think I find that somehow exciting , but they are not deeply impressed in their pur@@ ist art , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
the native concentration of K@@ all@@ ele has made an am@@ using documentary on the place and its famous offspring among which besides Tru@@ mp also the Ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mod@@ esty comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also said to word - so with the statement that he would surely also be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of his heart .
indeed , respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to think that Tru@@ mp is already a bit a great mas@@ onry , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
random , the nick@@ name , the k@@ all@@ stadt , in the locality , &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ macher &quot; - too high @-@ German : the An@@ ders , she says .
Tru@@ mp therefore comes from the village of the Andes .
the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began 1885 , when the later grandfather went out and opened in the US a pub for min@@ er .
stone of the property company were the first property sales in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from Tra@@ gic : your desire to return to the home in a long time , failed in the Bav@@ arian State , where the Palat@@ inate was once belonged .
he did not record Tru@@ mp because he was once dis@@ car@@ ded without permission , he had explained the Director of the Institute for P@@ äl@@ z@@ ische History and People , Roland Paul , to the film start .
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal tre@@ ach@@ ers . &quot;
this is contrast to the members of the follow @-@ up link .
he repeatedly had talked about Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a border zone for illegal immigrants .
&quot; as the upholstery , this is not so symp@@ athetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remot@@ eness of Tru@@ mp ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a native Tru@@ mp , the Op@@ a was born @-@ born Heinz . &quot;
the win@@ em@@ aker in retirement sees the US rather dist@@ anced , &quot; he is always so up@@ lifting . &quot;
believes he believes that Tru@@ mp occur ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can not imagine myself &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he never cares for c@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the Pen@@ sion@@ land@@ lady Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ram@@ m men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz spent on a visit to something for the church organ which was generally good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can I not imagine the Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they find it better if he doesn &apos;t want the choice because &quot; he has such ra@@ dicals , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the say at the time of his grandfather in the US , would have been like he , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ ke Sarah touches .
and as President ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; she says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ri@@ pe without the President Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ k@@ inson &apos;s go to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report following the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there has been no major shifts in reviews for today .

this draw@@ back of distance seemed to play a role for an Australian TV audience , since it generated average 39@@ ,000 spectators in the five capitals , compared to this today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today , a slight increase compared to the ratings on Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number stayed behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ ,000 ) .
today the gap to Sun@@ rise in the last months has closed .
in August the average 3@@ 18@@ ,000 today reached on an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ ,000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance between 4@@ 50,000 and 50,000 .
previously in September Sun@@ rise at an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators have at today 3@@ 14@@ ,000 at today .
this is the most interesting thing going every morning .
the winds of change affects this dawn more than the parliament !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series star of Rep@@ to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recent swe@@ ating father , who un@@ locks to settle with his two children at the New Zealand coast , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators .
critics had asked themselves whether Thom@@ son could carry a hit show Solo without the cap@@ turing Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of yesterday evening looked this with a clear &apos; yes . &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million spectators and made easy The block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8@@ ,000 ) and T@@ B@@ L Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had been mixed results on the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ C@@ ee@@ ched , yiel@@ ded an average of 44@@ ,000 viewers .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 until 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped on 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ards Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday night , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia was 5@@ 20,000 people and in the second half hour sat@@ te 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decrease at the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will definitely agree that hot @-@ Se@@ at will last will prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for million dollars that didn &apos;t manage to flee the Mc@@ Gu@@ ards Show .

the last three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have clearly unknow@@ ingly who wins The Bachelor &apos;s .
the woman , at the Sam Wood in The Bachelor finally ended , was covered in biggest secrecy .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not give away whether she is the one who has received the last rose .
but when we are with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows in the day before coming from three two , you possibly have acci@@ dently a clu@@ e about who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips up until the finals on Thursday sealed
all three women acquired themselves in a ly@@ rical manner , why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons for why they would like to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? , &quot; could their answers to play , who won the heart of the Bachelor &apos;s .
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - except for himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner in the wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had an easy relationship from day one to another .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and ( Sarah ) and Sam@@ s energies noticed that they were quite compatible and I thought it was the whole course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is standing on Earth with both feet on Earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; she added Mar@@ os@@ ki .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that it would be well suited to Sam Wood as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week , her clearly made to be the wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , it was clear to me that this is obviously not only a game - I am now subject to un@@ condi@@ tionally told him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked to choose , to choose , if not she , then she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girl alike - it is a tie between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broadcast on Wednesday , 19 : 30 , on Ten Com@@ ments .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle did a great interest after moving to the US - and there were many other teams that sent inquiries after his impressive training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ n chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a clever decision .
some coaches might have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bench as he lost a angel @-@ by @-@ league @-@ Conver@@ ti@@ t in his first p@@ unt Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his man and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a p@@ unt Return and also into the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula still showed his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of having his R@@ ook@@ ies to gr@@ ind the rest of the team by the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula increased Hay@@ ne also in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ re@@ porter Cam Indi@@ ans reported that Hay@@ n was also encouraged by specialist team coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who encouraged him to forget his missed flow and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne has a one in a p@@ unt which was restored in the first game of the Minnesota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers for his N@@ FL de@@ buted .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field and told later the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy to 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a bad start into his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; that was a thing that now occurs , you only take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne .
Hay@@ n upset the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in Deb@@ d in the year 2007 , when a passport leading to a T@@ ry for Queensland in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area .
overall it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

&quot; otherwise we will get conv@@ ul@@ sions in the Bav@@ arian education system . &quot;
the coun@@ ten@@ ance of the free voters conven@@ ed until Friday in the fran@@ con@@ ian Commun@@ e .
actually , quite other major subjects were supposed .
but the record number of refugees is now dominating the Free voters meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject for asylum will be over@@ consumed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ w@@ anger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , such as it existed during the Yugoslavia in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free voters leader . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to post@@ p@@ one the Free voters as quickly as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is why Ai@@ w@@ anger also demanded more personnel for the administrative bodies , which are responsible for asylum seekers : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new Asyl@@ um &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the F@@ W leader critici@@ zed that several provinces must not be consistent : &quot; we corro@@ bor@@ dering national standards of the federal states . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria shifts , others not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there we need to be able to act more flexible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the regional policy in the big @-@ ri@@ ot city shall not fall under the table .
a long trial of day@@ light remains on the agenda : the policy of education .

but that is not far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W leader . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call on freedom of choice for all secondary schools they want . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the site is planned to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , commerce and living .
you are waiting for appropriate offers , it is said on the part of the city .
which investor would be moved , be not yet clear .
no contracts have yet been closed accordingly .
the city Em@@ den had some of the property that is located on the Ring@@ straße / corner Big Street , which was already bought a few months ago and demol@@ ished the building .
P@@ ieve project : details are on the table
the plan@@ ations on the el@@ ab@@ lement of the Little Sea at Em@@ den are taking shape .
the investor publicly presented publicly plans for the project for the first time .
several An@@ li@@ eger are more troubled - they fear the res@@ ale of their leisure
months for months were behind closed doors , de@@ cent@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday resort are located on the little sea close to Em@@ den on the table .
the Inter@@ ent , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ der &quot; System @-@ Bau , &quot; presented its plans for the first time at the Mont@@ ag@@ evening &apos;s urban development committee .
originally this point was on the non @-@ public part of the order of the day .
under the pressure of the Project critic and the F@@ DP Group , the Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends of the System Building Manager in the offensive : &quot; we still don &apos;t have an answer to all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all the rum@@ ors now .
that is about ten to twelve million euros a big project for months in the discussion .
fierce reactions among sea @-@ owners who had come into the session called for the pictures and new details for the desired hotel building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , Meer@@ bus@@ ines and Board member at the Adv@@ ance of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , lam@@ ents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be a giant cube that dominates all the other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , he feared as many other project critics that the traffic would increase greatly by the intended size of the plant : &quot; as whole bus inv@@ itations will come , that this will reck@@ on , &quot; says Schulz
what exactly is on the well one h@@ ect@@ are of the former guest house , however , is still open .
there is no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only have we need to have a consistent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this is even lacking , the development plans are still variable .

Google launches dou@@ bling donations to collect 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling @-@ donations campaign to help the thousands of refugees who have exp@@ elled the thousands of refugees that the European nations have exp@@ ired since they are torn apart from war and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the announcement of the donations call on his blog .
instead of making a manager the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud wrote , a Google representative , who was flying with her family from Kab@@ ul that she was seven years old and her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our trip included many dark railway and bus trips , as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants would have grown in Europe , many people like my family are des@@ per@@ ately after help .
the donations are given at four non @-@ profit organisations which provide assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global donations collected up to a value of 5.5 million to google.com . that amount to 11 million dollars will be doubled .
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , which is largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many refugees also from the war led Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .
report by Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; edited by Christian Pl@@ um@@ b
for easy @-@ out di@@ gs , weight loss can be helpful .
the loss of weight loss treatment for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery are longer living as those who do not receive @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the death @-@ data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , that wrote an editorial in the new study in J@@ ama Surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss or obesity , use different methods to scale the size of the stomach .
you reduce the hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity have proved to be efficient to treat type @-@ 2 diabetes as efficiently , but most studies were carried out in people who are path@@ ological or obes@@ e with a Body measure index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a degree of weight regarding size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with BM@@ I above 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Taiwan &apos;s min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital Data collected since 2007 in a study and compare two kinds of obesity , gast@@ ric@@ yp@@ ass and stomach ul@@ c@@ ers - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes for people who were easily overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those under@@ went this operation sank from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile the BM@@ I was with those who not received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments were about the same at 29 .
among those who under@@ wear a surgical procedure , the diabetes must be entirely and at 28 % partially at 36 % .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , the diabetes care is completely only at one per cent and in part in only about two percent .
in addition , the results were in the controls of blood pressure , the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitoring the patient blood mirror from h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 per cent , write the researchers .
after surgery the average hem@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical treatment group it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - how can you reflect in the improved h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - decreased not the mortality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also negoti@@ ates average results in the two types of the surgery .
in the fifth year the b@@ yp@@ ass surgery group had lost weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , the bigger decl@@ ines in BM@@ I ( 7,@@ 4 against 5.1 ) and h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 1 % ) and listed more a full overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not pose a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of serious people in Sweden that leads surgery to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was subjected to obes@@ e individuals who have subjected themselves to obesity , approximately 29 percent less likely in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried to conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage to survival for the surgery patients , said Black@@ stone , it is soothing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation at this lower BM@@ I group is lower , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney illness , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start making weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long until we have people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think once they accum@@ ulate these genetic alter@@ ations that have joined their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a subject which is currently growing in fiction : a young woman , too popular and un@@ sigh@@ tly after years , meets the serp@@ ents of their youth , and this fell in love with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently released novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Luisa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the love story the novel is likely to be interesting for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , for he plays in Lang@@ w@@ eiler and the surrounding villages .
the Ar@@ ame@@ zia author has grown up in Lang@@ w@@ eiler and is pleased that they could place a literary monument to her homeland .
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot take all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East was lying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ti@@ be@@ tish Buddhist guides also called on violence in the country &apos;s home countries .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of continuing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech given to the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford that dedic@@ ates ethics studies .
he requested that under the circumstances , the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries was admir@@ able at the refugee crisis but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama was praised in Germany and Austria in addressing the crisis , he stressed that there is only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as a genuine peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ultimately , we must think about how the killing in their countries is reduced .
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised to solve the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist bom@@ bing of 11 September and presented that the non @-@ violent response from the USA attracted a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after the 11th September I put my sympath@@ ies in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in violence .
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence one , and this has resulted in unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama .
four @-@ fold increase of intake of mo@@ de@@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants through children in the last 4 years
Gi@@ ft@@ control centers in the United States report on almost 400 percent increase in number of children under 12 years that are highly alcoholic and disinf@@ ect@@ ants , so Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of income of hand infections in children below 12 years , the Gi@@ ft@@ control centres report , from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are increasingly becoming aware of these products , and sadly a percentage of them go in the not@@ ary , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said that some children could not drink ger@@ m@@ icide , while some do it to impress their friends , or because of a cle@@ ver@@ aging at social media .
videos on YouTube show how young disinf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
young people are supposed to have dis@@ infection with soft mouth water to obtain a tough@@ er drink .
younger children may be bon@@ ded by attractive no@@ ises of the disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are par@@ don@@ ated .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ er- , grapes and orange pe@@ ws that are very pleasing for children .
Hän@@ dis@@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
particularly in small children , a few spra@@ yers can already lead to alcohol poison@@ ing .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , medical Director of the Gi@@ ft@@ not@@ ary Hospital in the hospital of K@@ ans@@ as , the sender Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you would not make i@@ ck whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come about it then it is a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sy@@ r@@ inge from straw@@ berry du@@ f@@ ten@@ i@@ ti@@ zer to school was taken into a need for emergency .
your blood c@@ utter concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that is required by law when drunk , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency medical doctor , treated at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah did her words and was unable to go to her as she was able to take her .
doctors said about night in a separate children &apos;s clinic on the signs of Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma , because the girl had fallen by the alcohol and met her head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; this was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; said Or@@ tor@@ ia Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ une Mother , CN@@ N .
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and instru@@ ctors recommended to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ infection and to store lef@@ tist disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
beyond alcohol poison@@ ing out there were some dis@@ infection associated with deaths .
in 2013 two women died in Ontario women after the swal@@ lowing of hanging compounds that have a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
employee of health authorities susp@@ ect that the product meth@@ anol enth@@ s , a deadly solution , instead of ethylene co@@ hol , has been noted as active substance .
in January , three pup@@ il of the fourth class in the state of New York , their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teacher to det@@ oxi@@ fy their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teacher reporting these anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is a police report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the teacher is highly @-@ allergic to deal@@ er@@ dis@@ m and ex@@ iles them out of their space .
the police considered the failed plan as a &apos; weak@@ ened &apos; and &apos; trans@@ disciplinary action to the school@@ authorities .

former Rang@@ ers @-@ Medi@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , since there are no titles ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers .
de Bo@@ er , currently a Ambassador of Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland you &apos;ll show no high@@ points of the Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the ranks are not there .
people here talk not only about the return of the ranks .
you are talking about the Old Fir@@ m .
they speak about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not only the people of Scotland who want to see these games .
I will rot@@ ate things around , sha@@ ken D@@ eil@@ a .

now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it is very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel this exactly like that - but we have to go on .
we really need support from Celtic because that makes the player better .
now , it is so important .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom we total rise .
unemployment in Scotland was unchanged in the period May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom was increased by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.4 percent was reported above that of the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 per cent , as the figures of the office for National Statistics ( ons ) showed .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell around 12,000 throughout the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 .
the employment rate for Scotland fell in the course of the quarter to 7@@ 4.3 percent - a number above the UK average of 7@@ 3,5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is almost a year ago that Scotland reached the historic decision to stay part of the United Kingdom . &quot; &quot; &quot;

why I become a Exec@@ ution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a bit later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens and I hope that it is not happening , I will sit in an audience gallery at the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ sip will be det@@ ained by the injection @-@ injection .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was already made in January on his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I voted .
when the day was closer , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story about death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists should be able to see for journalists in the United States , and there are often more applicants working as places to decide who will choose who will be elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media spaces from 12 to five .
who is selected will it ex@@ cre@@ ase it .
I cannot do this .
I &apos;ll sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps eng@@ es with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with teleph@@ ones and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison @-@ authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not allow me to record a notebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , as he wants , and you will get access .
I describe myself with her .
she adm@@ its that she said &quot; it would have been better artic@@ ulate , &quot; but she still thinks it is wrong what I do .
Richard Com@@ sip had problems with some of the things I said and wrote .
he does not tell me what I have to write , and I would not do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove myself from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants that an international re@@ porter is present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement will help the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ y@@ ware , a re@@ por@@ ters of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is located next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I did .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I can not say with certainty that Richard Com@@ sip is inno@@ cent .
his acts after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would allow him to be a benefici@@ ary of deed .
but I believe that a strong lik@@ eli@@ hood is that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I can not claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ por@@ ters that you can contact .
what you get from me is what it means to die a man of an unnecessary death .

he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integration department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they gave a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last straw , on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do that which is best for racing and he didn &apos;t find themselves under difficult conditions when it was about the positive Kob@@ alt T@@ up@@ fer@@ test at Li@@ dar@@ i which he cannot explain .
he had with@@ held 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age accus@@ ations and didn &apos;t want to see that it &quot; see &quot; as too high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about this , and I have long attached to it , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out once , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy .
they know that it is far going forward .
sometimes it is re@@ acted , and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to be the main purpose and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I do not do that , then I should not be a trainer .
I don &apos;t have to think about what I do with my license .
before M@@ oo@@ dy had uploaded the bom@@ b in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integration department had tried to sp@@ ying his barn .
&quot; in front of eigh@@ teen months , Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart in a room with a man - I will design@@ ate - and offered him a job in my stables to deliver information on what I do within my stalls , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com
they believed that I am a che@@ at .
if that is the case , they should certainly put on their n@@ oses , because they attempt to summ@@ ing me down .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former president of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , acting president of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ und@@ .com , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at that time and are still today .
should I be able to view that it is personally ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave de@@ fi@@ antly and perhaps makes people responsible outside of trainers who are in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think there , that I am .
maybe they have to take my license and rejected me , and I have no doubt that what I say , let them think about it now .
but I arrived at the point where I no matter is , and that makes me sad .
this really makes me sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will exercise the pressure on them and push them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the fruit @-@ levels of the trainer have built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt examination of Li@@ dar@@ i and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching led to that he could throw &quot; his license on the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by its preparation of the UFO &apos;s Black C@@ avi@@ ar , drew the racing overall treatment rule , &quot; ridic@@ ulous &quot; after a pack of mud or sound had been applied to the s@@ ledge that fell against the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has w@@ alled mud upon the leg .
we could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been the whole day yesterday , what was so .
and it was also so on the race .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack at the race day . an examination of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set these rules don &apos;t know about this horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have to go far , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ am@@ y proposes to fight ri@@ vals for cont@@ ention for cont@@ ention
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig F@@ am@@ y has critic@@ ised the Tac@@ x his player as an &quot; Agenda &quot; setting from two Premier League F@@ av@@ our@@ ites from the NR@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ee will have allowed the Storm player &quot; Ring@@ fights &quot; with his team during the high rock victory in Sydney on Friday evening .
Brisbane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne B@@ enn@@ ett made a little hidden note to the Storm Team , after his team had scored the final victory against North Queensland co@@ w@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League , and said that the two from Queensland not &quot; be too good &quot; in the w@@ ro@@ wer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ am@@ y defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ b of his team and said that she was concentr@@ ating only on her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ am@@ y imp@@ lied that the criticism of two leaders in his team added him with confidence , because it rep@@ ented that they were worried about being be@@ aten by the Storm team .
&quot; that &apos;s always up again - I did not hear that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about ring fights , when they told us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ am@@ y on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing at our defensive system or the techniques throughout the year . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kl@@ es to a real focus and that has produced for us the trend .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years , and he obviously has a great team to train . he &apos;s probably not losing it being acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to losing , so it was a bit of shock for him .
it is strange , as this season shows up again and again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ am@@ y has attacked B@@ enn@@ et &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football , &quot; and his ment@@ or reminds that B@@ enn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; te@@ di@@ ous &quot; football .
Wayne speaks about exciting football .
he was compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening , and how exciting their game was , &quot; said Bell@@ er@@ y .
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a te@@ di@@ ous team , and Wayne said he will take care of a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team who can play this and that we can look forward as exciting , especially his young players at their speed .
this is the ball game that you want to play if you have this kind of player .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players such as Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so that they can play as they can .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
six weeks ago they did not think of us when it was the Big Games .
Bell@@ am@@ y pointed out that the game Storm from R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the Bron@@ cos against co@@ w@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there have been two other attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks , and no points do some ten@@ sion@@ ing ?
for me it is the maps .
when they mention , it means that we will meet in a stage still .
the Storm team free from this weekend because they have won the right to either receive North Queensland co@@ w@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ k on the next Saturday evening in the Final Park . ticket sales begin from next morning .
Ser@@ bi@@ er with 200,000 $ deposit on Dru@@ gs
a man who possibly threat@@ ens a life @-@ long punishment because of his trial , into the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were squ@@ ander@@ ed after Queensland , was released against a deposit of 200,000 $ .
Mar@@ ko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the Yacht Sol@@ ay which came from South America about Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and settled in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he met his fellow students during the afternoon and later at Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police took 40 kilograms of dro@@ ge in a Toyota echo .
despite some potentially vital punishment for making an attempt to possess a commercial amount co@@ ca@@ ine , argued the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the café could have been a harmless reason .
the judge of the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter F@@ agan , was worried about the floods of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travelled to Serbia , &quot; he declared the judgment on Wednesday .
the police have lied the police on his place of residence .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs mother and Sti@@ ef@@ at had a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as a security together to reach his release .
&quot; after reading the re@@ plac@@ ental explanations of the two persons it is clear that the event of an security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said Ju@@ dge , Re@@ agan .
but this alone will not suff@@ ice to keep it from it , and not to appear , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against damage deposit , under the conditions that he announces his Australian and his Serbian passport , det@@ ained at the police and stick to a cur@@ few of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

Stev@@ an Ho@@ g@@ g used phone of girls to enti@@ ce pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le to send pictures
a pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the phone of a 11 year old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
Stev@@ an Ho@@ g@@ g received the phone of the girl she slept in an online mess@@ aging service that he st@@ amped in an online mess@@ aging service that he received a number of un@@ decent pictures of children who were sent to him by another user .
the girl up later on and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping farm .
she watched it through , found the confusing messages and al@@ armed immediately her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five pictures , analysed , then computers which were found under the address and discovered &quot; web research that used concepts for search of un@@ decent pictures of children .
Ho@@ g@@ g said then to the officials that he did it because it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le in the internet &quot; and he then &quot; Pre@@ war@@ y , &quot; a polic@@ eman to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are them . &quot;
the At@@ tor@@ ia E@@ ili@@ ie Rober@@ ts@@ on said to the Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a addiction that he is addi@@ ctive , to frigh@@ ten people .
he gave that searches were performed on the computer from him , but said , unless he wanted to pret@@ end a polic@@ eman to make pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le .
he asked for his talks with the in@@ famous person who sent him the pictures and he asked him to send more photos .
he said he did so to enti@@ ce them .
he said he was sick in the head , if he drinks , and said he wants to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the messages on the phone , she called her mother and was at tre@@ mb@@ ling and crying .
she then saw the un@@ decent pictures on the phone and confron@@ ting the def@@ endants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the def@@ endant computer and Play@@ station took advantage to talk to girls who looked after much younger than he did .
Ho@@ g@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ de@@ e , stated clearly in the meaning of the indictment to have un@@ decent pictures of children on 14 June last year , and did not appear before the trial at a hearing on 24 March of this year .
Secretary of Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ g@@ g does not appear in the register of sexual criminal proceedings , since one could argue that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no considerable sexual element &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be found in his off@@ ense . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael disappeared from jud@@ ging judgment till October in order to receive background information about social work .
Ho@@ g@@ g was reported in this case damage , but was held in pre@@ trial for hear@@ ings to other in@@ tra @-@ related cases .
he was still included before the judgment of the judgment in the directory of the sexual criminal proceedings .

the mass makes it : every two years the auto@@ graph at IA@@ A show its novel@@ ties .
in 2015 above all , there is movement to record the compact car that is currently extremely well sold .
cars from the compact class are currently in high demand : around 2@@ 8,@@ 1 per cent of new registrations fell according to the Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August this segment .
this is also reflected in the IA@@ A ( public@@ um@@ days 17 @-@ 27 September ) .
among all the futur@@ istic concept and new luxury cars and luxury cars this year there are many new compact models presented in this year .
the Opel A@@ stra is one of the biggest Premi@@ ers for the German auto industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the A@@ stra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
that the volume model is also well sold , the new A@@ stra should not be much more expensive for this .
Opel poses an entry below the biggest competition VW Golf in Outlook that starts at 17 650 Euros .
the current A@@ stra costs 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the A@@ stra provides a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 HP .
in addition , the H@@ esse are offering additional diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 HP to 147 kW / / 200 b@@ hp to those for the first time also three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines .
unlike the most important competition VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel A@@ stra gives us only as five @-@ fifth .
as a second variant , I will follow in the spring of the com@@ bi which is already visible at the IA@@ A .
and what will the A@@ stra be driving on new compact cars next to the A@@ stra ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault is the fourth generation of his A@@ stra cont@@ enders , Mé@@ gan@@ e in the race .
the Mé@@ gan@@ e fair is to be seen only as five @-@ fifth in a conventional and an emph@@ atic GT @-@ Version .
he comes to trade in the early next year , then also as a com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan Alliance wishes to find its position in the strong growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti adap@@ ts with its curved lines fully into the design line of the brand .
the base model will get a pet@@ rol engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
but the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 kW or 125 kW / 170 kW / 170 kW .

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has given the Federal Constitutional Court to an ex @-@ prisoners of the pen@@ y@@ run file hed@@ gehog , which accommod@@ ates one month in a small cell .
due to the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation , if they are in small cells .
this was the Federal Constitutional Court on a resolution published on Wednesday .
sufferers may even hope for the judges even if they were imprison@@ ed in their public rooms only a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 B@@ v@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
with this , an ex @-@ in@@ mate was successful in Karlsruhe with his Constitutional Court : he was housed in the Pen@@ et@@ enti@@ ary Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel in Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 in a single cell of approximately 5 square metres of ground floor ; the toilet was not dis@@ connected .
after that , the man who had moved once again on free foot according to the indications of his ste@@ wards , to a larger cell .
his official se@@ minal ves@@ tion due to the terrible conditions laid down in the country of Berlin .
but the Constitutional Ju@@ dge lifted the judgement of the chamber Berlin and transferred the case to renewed examination .
they regard the man &apos;s dignity .
Chamber judgment now decides over amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons caused by the question@@ able period only a few days of adhesi@@ on to the compensation , be an equ@@ itable allocation , it meant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise it would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fail@@ ing to fear the judicial protection of the personality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chamber tri@@ bunal must now be given the amount of the damage .
the Constitutional Ju@@ dge have often reinforced the rights of prisoners of prisoners in the past .
that was the case in April of an in@@ mate case , because he was naked in a cell in prison .
in 2011 a human dis@@ si@@ re is consequently also the multi@@ purpose assignment of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , in addition , the Berlin Constitutional Court , the Berlin Constitutional Court , who had an in@@ mate in a parallel in a parallel in November 2009 had filed an@@ un@@ decent accommodation .
the former Kl@@ äger was established over three months daily from 15 to 21 hours in a like cell , as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pr@@ isons were made into the head@@ lines during the last few weeks .
prisoners are therefore always locked for 23 hours , the aggressi@@ veness rises , even to bat , it should have already been due to the tense situation .
after information on the judicial system , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to lack of use , 19 should 2016 falling away .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
the immigration of refugees is a tremendous challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what comes to Germany ?
about 800 000 asylum seekers , according to the forecasts of the Federal Ministry for Agriculture in this year are coming to Germany , according to the statement by vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to enter a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; speaking about the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can create it and we create it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different forecasts between 3@@ 50@@ 000 ( according to the Federal Ministry of State ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institute ) , the next five years are needed .
this is almost twice as much as previously it is built ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) .
dramatically is the lack of living room but above all with paid rent objects : every year 60@@ ,000 and 80@@ ,000 social housing generated from the rental price , and around these particularly favorable apartments will also apply to refugees .
Federal Minister of Ministers in Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) intends to double the promotion of currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social apartments a year had to arise and the federal government should invest in the amount of € 6.@@ 4 billion a year .
agreed , scientists and the Federal Minister of Govern@@ ments agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investments in the construction of housing .
according to the research institute for labour market research and occupational research , it is estimated that 55 percent of the refugees are unemployed in Germany in the long term .
however , in Germany the refugees would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them in getting started , Claudia Walter , project management for integration and education at the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation .
but the integration of refugees is decisive whether they will find work in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation of the reception society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , says migration researchers Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to Thr@@ es@@ hardt it has given a political change : from employment ban to refugees to recognise work .
while it used to be a working ban for asylum seekers from up to five years , this was reduced in November 2014 at three months , as well as the residences , asylum seekers on a residential site .
in society - also because of the lack of qualified labour - they have asser@@ ted a view of the view that refugees should be able to access the labour market faster .
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is a lack of German language skills .
until now there is no adequate supply of general and CP@@ I @-@ related language courses .
studies also show that jobs are most often convey@@ ed by personal contacts .
the layout of networks is therefore depending on the throne of the throne of the Royal Road to Arbeit@@ sin@@ tegr@@ ation .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few refugees leave their children to the kids , estimated at least ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the ro@@ oting parents &quot; it is only very important to keep the family together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ bar , spokes@@ person for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to convince the family nonetheless of the advantages of the K@@ ita , distri@@ butes the management to@@ kens in different languages .
should the need for educ@@ ators increase greatly by the large numbers of refugees would the Berlin Senate try to increase the capacity of training - by increasing higher education schools .
in the countries we are prepared for classes without German skills in welcome classes .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers and teachers but , as in Berlin , also of teachers , who have only one qualification in German as a secondary language .
at them there is no shortage , says Be@@ ate St@@ suit@@ case from the Berlin school administration .
the German Stud@@ enten@@ werk appreci@@ ates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle no federal state asylum nor commemor@@ ated the study - the only exception was to Berlin , Interior Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up his stance however .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; study @-@ willing refugees could facilitate access to the college . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because displ@@ aced persons with a residence permit or ul@@ ing not received any services after the asylum seek@@ er &apos;s Act when they start a study .
the latter is basically no BA@@ Fö@@ G , as they do not fall under the circle of the authorized people .
patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be entitled to BA@@ Fö@@ G from January 1st , 2016 , this donation is shortened to 15 months .
but this Fin@@ gap must be closed , but the St@@ effen Kra@@ ch , Berlin State Secretary for Science , and the German Stud@@ enten@@ werk .
students should immediately get BA@@ Fö@@ G .
in future , Islam will play a more important role in the future , because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important component of their identity .
the state should gradually cover the same rights as they have the churches , and develop the existing state @-@ churches @-@ law to a new state of religions .
important also would be the founding of a Muslim Wel@@ fare State , who takes care of the new@@ com@@ ers .
the rights also include obligations .
thus the representatives of Islam must be based on clear contact persons and be ready to work together with the state in many fields , and give them some control options .
this is also a willingness to act against religious fundament@@ alism .
the President of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , vo@@ iced the concern that religious conflicts can also be entered into Germany .
those who want to fight such conflicts in Germany , &quot; immediately their right to stay here , in Germany , he said in Bay@@ rische Rund@@ funk .
he proposed to translate the Basic Law on Arabic .
integration will be much more today than today a topic of society as a whole .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will also have to change the majority society , the reduction of discrimination and racism is also urgent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - since a scar@@ ce decade an anti @-@ discrimination site and a general gender equality law .
but it gets very slowly , as the NS@@ U @-@ M@@ ord@@ serie showed , in the police and authorities the rac@@ ist moti@@ f systematically ignored .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants &apos; organizations and stakeholders are committed to undertake and why international agreements , such as the Anti@@ racial Convention of Germany , must become a reality in the coming years , when the country will remain peaceful and use its new citizens to benefit their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is capable of providing the expected refugees to date , says Shi@@ z@@ te@@ president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what Man@@ - Power and capacities are affecting , we create it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , , is calling for all travellers under the registration of health cards .
we could later be pay@@ ed with the Bundes@@ länder later .
and in the long run it was highly question@@ able to attract so many people with the restricted capacity , which the asylum seek@@ er .
otherwise the doctors have to make especially the barriers .
even so far , the Berlin scientific resear@@ cher@@ in The@@ a Bor@@ de has been detected , immigrants get worse off their disease than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in doctors have to take charge of interpre@@ ting , she asks for them .
many refugees would also be helped with more u@@ bi@@ ous medical bill in the emergency @-@ out offices .
and with another diagnostic glance .
among refugee veins , there are clearly more un@@ treated disabilities , and with the young people I go to HIV enlightenment .
with the partial German illness @-@ pictures German doctors from their education became clear , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; par@@ asi@@ bility or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what does not affect the angu@@ ish angel , be it in sight caused by the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed educational system , some of the refugees would be even doctors .
in order to practice them , they would have to prove their qualifications and require further ex@@ ams .
at least half of the refugees coming in Germany is psychological disease ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) is psychological ill : most suffer from a post traum@@ atic disorder or , for depression .
particularly vulnerable , his refugee @-@ inder , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study published by TU München demonstrates that every fifth of Syrian refugees are trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
who is suffering from a post traum@@ atic disorder , suffering from other things on so @-@ called Flas@@ h@@ backs with air@@ pressure , di@@ zz@@ iness , cardi@@ ac and death @-@ fear@@ ful .
further symptoms are sleeping and concentr@@ ations , strong , and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
to prevent that the symptoms were chronic , be a early treatment necessary , explained mouth .
however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically @-@ sick refugees leave a psychotherapy .
although mentally ill @-@ seekers can provide an application for psychotherapy in the social @-@ tern , but it usually takes several months .
moreover , in the welfare , most commonly used workers or doctors , who are not trained for the mental conditions , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this lead often to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .

Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe gives a false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , at the end of the year , fell down the stairs at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video &apos;s video quickly became popular via social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opening of Parliament has also been tri@@ mm@@ ed by Members of the opposition so that anonymous de@@ min@@ ations would have been received and they have been warned of accompanying the address by Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month they had booked him and interrupted him during his speech in the state of the nation in the parliament - this is the talk he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of the movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven Op@@ positions politicians have received SMS messages on their phones which they warned against it , Mr. Mu@@ ff@@ es An@@ ders to dis@@ rupt .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but she said the title &apos; death &apos; , he said journalists by the b@@ lot speech .
they war@@ ns the European Parliament &apos;s members that immunity in the Parliament will end , and once they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immunity are no longer effective .
the chief teacher said that by Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i , the Party was &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers to politicians .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build up to 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the context of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will divide into two listed companies later this year and separate the computer and printer shop of its fast growing company hardware and its service activities .
the expected job market leads to a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unity after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise is becoming less and more focused than it is HP today and we have a wide and abundant portfolio of shops that support companies at transition to a new style of business , &quot; says Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the needs of our customers around the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion annual revenue of revenue and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to provide previously Un@@ ri@@ oting , integrated technology solutions for companies to be concentrated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such an explanation of the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shares a company that was founded in the 1930@@ s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard , to produce electric systems and whose Palo Alto garage is named &apos; the birth@@ place of the Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has passed a massive restructuring to cope with the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC @-@ manufacturer and one of the biggest US tech companies , is the newest in this area which is based on the conviction that close focused companies can perform better performance .
FC Arsenal &apos;s captain Mik@@ kel Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates are to stand behind the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the last Jack Wild C@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger emphas@@ ised that it is only September and provided his rehabilitation after plan , there is no reason why he cannot play Christmas again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and in the face of its history , its involvement in the next summer will certainly still be uncertain .
the great shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate an@@ tic@@ ent account , and then returned to his old momentum during the pres@@ eas@@ on .
&quot; this sort of injury does not threat the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it is a bones that is not cur@@ able .
it is not a major matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in touch with his buttons or with the injury that he previously had .
this may be true from pure medical point of view , but as well recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , always when a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops a uncomfortable pattern .
the study by Premier In@@ j@@ uries Ltd had 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut in six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of Ar@@ sen@@ als 157 Lig@@ tion in the last five seasons .
the wider picture for ar@@ senal is that in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 they were one of the two Premier League clubs , most of the vulner@@ ability have recorded .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but ar@@ senal believes that an improvement in the accus@@ ation rate during the last season will last .
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have a fold period of time , a time when you will have to strengthen your body and win combat force , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome it .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will undergo a career of the way he deserves .
ar@@ senal starts his Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ track at the upcoming Wednesday , and turning puts a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start .
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Reb@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give to the players who need it to give up a little car@@ ving . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the ar@@ senal are clear , through group F forward , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the greatest inser@@ tions effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched in the last season .
the stadium was sha@@ ken on Tuesday evening by an earthquake , sha@@ ken to the R@@ R@@ scale 3 : 2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is that ar@@ senal the teaching of last season with the Champions League cap@@ ulation against Monaco and remains committed by the distant hope , with his management to lead the association to his first Europ@@ ap@@ ocal@@ al triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked out at ar@@ senal .
we were very close to it in 2006 but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show that gives us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open themselves , now even dou@@ bt@@ ful than ever before has become , as self @-@ murder in young men on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the main cause of death in men at the age of 20 to 45 in Britain , and it remains for three times more prevalent in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ape Living Mis@@ er@@ park ( CA@@ LM - campaign against a pi@@ tiful life ) 2015 as the Year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture to question , the men are doing to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the fight to master this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with anti @-@ depress@@ symptoms identified that when the suff@@ erer had enough high percentage of friends with a healthy atmosphere , &quot; his chances of recovery was du@@ bi@@ ased .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of spirit@@ ually healthy friends are the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends so that a friendship may work .
in the age of more than social media in communication , with their main focus on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital lives have the need to become strong , lively and successful , doubles , even if in reality the isolation dominates .
this superf@@ icial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologist extr@@ ater@@ restri@@ al values call ; money , image , social status , everything on cost in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy .
the Beautiful at Friends was that this focuss@@ ing on the head has been placed .
every character was not defined by his work , but by his personality accompanied by the interaction of a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments when football stri@@ cken in cosy arm@@ chairs and the longing from R@@ oss to Rachel - all this came from knowing that men can refer to each case , even if they often go back , completely explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how a member of the phone readiness it stated to me : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my hearing role for people who feel de@@ pressed and mur@@ mur@@ dered , has really shown me significantly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us feel often not able to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will deal with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous impact as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness if one speaks openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term work@@ ings .
they clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so much of my objective out@@ si@@ der status over the phone calls to help men in moments of despair also may help the long term assistance comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you come to this weekend get@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ festival with which to celebrate the day completely new , why don &apos;t take your friends to drink a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or even better if you &apos;re sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks someone alone will give it a smile and say Hi .
you never know what difference your friendship might make .
friends is sent to Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - the entire 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to rent R@@ Malmö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ dy Cav@@ ani following his hit against Malmö .
at his debut in the Champions League at the Tuesday and helps to watch PS@@ G to Malmö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held a course as Paris Saint @-@ Germain made its Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ ce@@ park@@ on on Tuesday started .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League &apos;s deb@@ tor as PS@@ G player who brought the French master to the way , but afterwards she missed out a number of opportunities before they finally reached their lead , when Cav@@ ani made a head header in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with real Madrid and chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish Masters , since they are not only striving for the qualification for the N.@@ C.@@ -@@ rounds , but an improvement in the way to the quarter @-@ finals at any of the last three campaigns .
but while they were given the points , there was no Classi@@ c@@ iel of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs temp@@ est chances in front of the gate . he later became in his game against his hom@@ etown of Team and against the association , which he started his illustr@@ ative career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or down@@ wards in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start , 2 : 0 to win our enemies problems and look back even if there are certain things that we have to perf@@ ected in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; this is a good sign .
we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we have not scored one or two more gates . &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned after his violation in one of three changes to Paris @-@ Team , which was decided on the weekend a 2 : 2 indi@@ ges@@ tion on his own place to Bordeaux in the First League , but he was running through Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ in@@ ean wing was referred to as the man who took the PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he went over to Manchester United in the last month , and he pointed out why he was Johan Wil@@ and finished nicely in the long corner of the court .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would win a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malmö , the Celtic in an play @-@ off suggested to reach this level , stood at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and ended with a five @-@ man defense and two deeply rooted in the middle field a heavy opponent .
but besides a shot by Nikola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who went far to Kevin Tr@@ ini@@ sts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G got himself on , with some und@@ es@@ mis@@ ses and bad circuits , not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who had been abandoned with no less than five attempts in the first half , and then fell after Cav@@ ani had used him after restart .
nevertheless he showed much more skill when he brought his fellow player into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , whom Di Maria was turned into a turning point which was caught by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the pole .
the second gate finally fell short after the hours @-@ brand thanks to Cav@@ ani . he then recorded his sixth season , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had filed a left edge of Max@@ well .
this ended all the thoughts that Malmö could not return to the game , and only an excellent input of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result low before the stre@@ et@@ aker E@@ ze@@ qu@@ iel Lav@@ e@@ zzi has detected a gate at the end .
the coach of Malmö , age Har@@ eide , announced later that PS@@ G played a class about his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year .
since then , we have played only in the Swedish league , who did not have the same level .
the qualification @-@ games are not enough . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

during the season , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off B@@ ritten , until the finale .
the climbing task was to climb to a 75 minute long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
B@@ ritten conclu@@ des the task within time , which he was the first ath@@ lete to complete the first ath@@ lete to complete the exhau@@ sting phase 4 by American Ninja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with e ! messages after the harsh struggle , still under shock about winning the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ .
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I never had to earn more than 10,000 $ , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his lot of money .
so all suddenly .. how I can not even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the Le@@ ent Produc@@ er K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the finale and why B@@ ritten , although he first finished the course , won &apos;t get any prize money .
after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much the money is a wonderful price and life changes , he gets the great gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t believe that he won &apos;t have any gro@@ ove .
he &apos;s just so happy to have done what he has done .
masses of awards received from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family @-@ father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be be@@ aten by somebody , I am glad it was Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac was just as comfortable when they had lab@@ elled the roles .
America Ninja Warrior was extended for an eighth season , the shooting will be started in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak to Minnesota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
before they were once one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers are standing on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as Spo@@ kes@@ creen , played this part however on Tuesday perfect against Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target Field .
the T@@ wins have spent a chance of climbing during a game half of Houston , to the second American league Wild@@ card Square .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F words that was so hard to hold about a big part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories have fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad dis@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon gave up his early offensive support , as Detroit had scored three times in the first two inner points , then once in the sixth and then once down@@ stairs .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) proposed 6 times in the 1 / 3 inner and made it possible for three rest .
it was only his third successful start in his final nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will end this year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ se@@ er each game and so I want to concentrate entirely in the game .
the des@@ ig@@ ated tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three suitable matches and was in two R@@ us , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid August .
it was the first three hit @-@ hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits with the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has good sw@@ ings on the wood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said payout . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the ( drums ) , looked clearly better in the Bull@@ ring , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three movements in the background on the end of the seventh interior , T@@ wins had the best chance to come back into play .
center Fiel@@ ding the Byr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left margin .
Right Watch the Aaron H@@ icks finished a b@@ unt , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ tion Brian Du@@ cian to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy was going down , the only man with which he was faced with which he joined @-@ design@@ ate R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ stroke Miguel S@@ ano , who run the right @-@ handed barrel for a Two @-@ Run .
with a pair of buyers and the gradu@@ ation at the second led ver@@ ages the third Bas@@ tion Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double Play .
it was the leading 27 times in this season that pl@@ ou@@ ffe , a double Play beat
after Detroit added an Insurance under the end of the ne@@ lower , the wall gave an R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed reef however S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for its fifth Save .
Detroit prof@@ ited in the opening of the game from an even movable Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers made three rings made in the first two inner against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been removed from the injury list before the game was missing more than a month ago .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted me , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable than I started , and sen@@ sed that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches here in the third inning . &quot;
after they received the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter , Hus@@ um gave a single to Second Bas@@ tion Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought in Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z , who gave a single &quot; up the Middle &quot; at the first Run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z worked his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ tion Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right , created another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to go to the third , what the threat ended .
the Tig@@ ers presented in the second , achieved one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony G@@ osis to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he has not particularly sm@@ itten down but he has the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ Count , showed no points in the third inning before being replaced by the rel@@ ie@@ ver @-@ handed . J.@@ F.@@ I.@@ S. could be replaced .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es , it came to three rank@@ ings at six hits and one walk with four stro@@ kes .

hundreds of refugees should come in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was anticipated for the night on Wednesday .
the most vulnerable people are to be accommod@@ ated in Wiesbaden , such as the city of Wiesbaden on the evening of Wiesbaden .
it counted on 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian provincial capital had been prepared for this case in the past few days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily double there .
then they should be distributed to other municipalities .
alone in the last ten days , the Govern@@ ors &quot; title G@@ ießen 7@@ 500 people had arrived in H@@ esse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also Frankfurt and Han@@ au have set up a large number of refugees &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency accommodations in sports halls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ischgl : German military measures in Syria
the head of the Munich &apos;s Security Conference , Wolfgang Ischgl , considers military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the more decisive re@@ thinking about military action may not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he threw the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was happy that the cup of a military stake in Germany has gone past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict escal@@ ating against our front door , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at Deutsch@@ land@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German Ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase of international aid to the refugees .
Austria controls Southern and Eastern borders
Austria has once again introduced Austria to its southern and Eastern borders .
the Austrian Minister in Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner explained on the Saturday evening in the Austrian TV channel OR@@ F , in Hungary no one will return now .
Germany too did not return to Austria for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it is so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
upon the question of an agreement , after which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there was already relevant discussions between the Director General for Public Security and Security of Germany .
concrete figures calling them not and pointed to discussions on Wednesday in Berlin .
tens of thousands of refugees came from Hungary to Austria over the last few days .
your goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and their Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit for next week with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not yet been able to agree on a common approach to the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU &apos;s interior ministers will want to take on Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special start for the binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees .
given the strong refugees post in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of the people .
in cooperation with the countries , Merkel will be announced at the late office evening after almost four @-@ hour consultation with the Prime Minister of the Regi@@ on@@ Office in Berlin .
Merkel underlined , those individuals who bri@@ mming the protection against them too .
but whoever does not have a &quot; eye @-@ eye view , could not be able to stay in Germany too .
this view was dra@@ fted in the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now master a &quot; enormous strength of force . &quot;
thousands of des@@ perate refugees are now stuck in the Balkan route .
Hungary had concluded its 175 kilometers long border with Serbia on the night of Tuesday .
a few hours later the government announced in Budapest to renew the border to Romania with a fence .
that country is unlike Serbia to the EU .
Hungary would susp@@ end that the tu@@ g@@ um dis@@ car@@ ess was examined over Romania , Hungarian Minister of Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the proposed new border fence .
the Romanian government condemned the plan promptly .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
in Turkey , meanwhile , thousands of migrants were reported on the way to the Greek border .
spac@@ ecraft &quot; C@@ ass@@ ini &quot; is located in the ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the E@@ isp@@ an@@ zer of Satur@@ n@@ mon@@ ds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the close researchers from observations of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ ass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore the moon is gently along its orbit around the ring plan@@ ed .
this num@@ al movement is only small , but still too large for a thoroughly firm cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is in a communication by the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( U.S. state of New York ) from Tuesday .
the researchers make their analysis in the journal I@@ car@@ us .
already for longer it was known that there must be under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us fluid .
thus , &quot; C@@ ass@@ ini had already discovered I@@ ass@@ ini on the South Pole of Satur@@ n@@ mon@@ ds , the water vap@@ or and ice par@@ c@@ els and thus the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn .
at least at the south @-@ pole it must be an underground public , the astronom@@ ers joined at that time .
however , the extent of the hidden ocean was not yet clear .
R@@ ama is missing 18@@ 60 in Munich several weeks
the 18@@ 60 Munich has to ab@@ stain from A@@ ama for about a month .
a study has revealed a declaration of ad@@ ministers in the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , divided the association with .
R@@ ama had initiated any liability for the first week in the beginning of the week .
according to Munich Leu@@ ven , the diagnosis &quot; probably means four weeks of forced re@@ pri@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this makes us hard , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we have to think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ DS Nec@@ kl@@ as Ay@@ ben@@ n the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; image &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paper with a view of the possible commitment of a united professionals . &quot; &quot; &quot;

no diet @-@ fruit - man@@ goes too much sugar
Man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but whoever wants to watch on his slim line will be out of them often more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because Man@@ gos has relatively much sugar - above all Sac@@ char@@ ose .
healthy are the exotic fruits nevertheless : in them are B vitamins , plus the vitamins E and C. In addition do Man@@ gos but much vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor beta @-@ K@@ aro@@ tin .
who e@@ ats the fruits thus supports t@@ ear@@ heads , immune system and met@@ abolic processes within the body .
when purchasing , Man@@ gos should not be too soft or too strong and gentle .
the paint color alone does not say anything about how ri@@ pe the fruit is - thus also green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at the room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then , they taste of course pure or in sweet meals .
in a man@@ go there is also hearty dishes a special touch .

first F@@ il@@ storm , then striking cold front
in the coming night breaking down in the valleys of the Alps @-@ north@@ side of the F@@ öh@@ n , like Met@@ eo@@ Schweiz by the Tuesday after@@ no@@ ons .
on Wednesday and at night for Thursday the F@@ öh@@ n partially bl@@ amed with the pet@@ rels through the valleys .
after F@@ öhn@@ end on Thursday morning , we crosses a striking cold front , which brings powerful rains , wind bows and a temperature down@@ ward .
as Met@@ eo@@ News is in a communication , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area over the British islands in a strong southern exposure .
on the north@@ side of the Alps , the night break@@ eth through the valleys .
in the episode , the F@@ öh@@ n until Thursday morning in the F@@ öhn@@ le valleys with hillside of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and specially in the jungle , partly also with more than 100 km / h .
the F@@ öh@@ n can advance to the adjacent mid@@ point and on the mountains are even organ bows of more than 120 km / h possible .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my fe@@ n for som@@ mer@@ sible temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the moisture has to be cut at the Alp@@ ens@@ ü@@ d@@ hang .

Rome now has a Martin Luther King &apos;s place now
just under 500 years after the Reformation , there was a Martin Luther square in Rome .
in the presence of city @-@ president Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino the name of the park was baptized in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill on the name of the German Reform@@ ist .
on the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honored as &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ seum .
the naming was filed by the study community of the evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran congregation in Rome , reminded of the protest in the city of the Pop@@ es for centuries as a minority often only in hiding their faith .
with the place will be visible in a symbolic manner that the tradition of the Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was established as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the beginning of 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he received the city at that time as an income for a sin @-@ fall .
his negative impressions are likely to be strengthened by historians in his later fight against Rome .
Luther started then with his theses on the crossed trading the spl@@ itting of the comfor@@ ting church .
hammer artist invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gol@@ stadt ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the main works created by the Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and the Bible texts updated .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible who has now appeared with gorgeous pictures .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 moti@@ fs was formulated his completely personal interpre@@ tations of scrip@@ tural stories on paper and canvas .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means consistent with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary , adjusted the respective topics , it can quite be quite dark .
&quot; &quot; &quot; approximately three years , Ot@@ mar Alt in his Bible project has worked for which he made a subjective artistic choice from the many fields of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; book of all books &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have emerged cycles , who are thinking about themes such as the Cross , P@@ agues , commandments or fighters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this , he has spontane@@ ously fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther publisher with his the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with his main focus on books .
and there is mainly the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has elaborate on the basis of painting with the respective scriptures .
he interpreted the Bible from Ot@@ mar Old Bible study and thus translated into today , in current contexts . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror of al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between Martin Luther &apos;s original profession and a set of artist , who draws his very personal thoughts about the situation here .
the jewelry band has golden letters .
the 75 @-@ year @-@ old adds twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of intimacy .
emotions ultimately were a trigger for the Bible Project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode born and raised in Berlin , comes from a family who listened to the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ ud@@ der Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the education happened already with the pi@@ an , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to get this up , in order to be able to return to the Lord again with the Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second aim is to bring art to more value in a fast @-@ time period : &quot; the perception of photography is now characterized by re@@ cl@@ ame and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is forced there .
artists have a different desire and glad@@ ness , things to demonstrate .
pictures have always something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a dinosau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar alt wants that the spect@@ ator can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lead into the images &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to let them appear , discover and feel what power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image is looking for his face . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Old ep@@ ost , and on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old @-@ Foundation , &quot; has always been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Kunst , &quot; I like he understands how he understands with his paintings . &quot;
old I have not gone to grasp the Bible completely , but the most important and also mysterious subjects .
&quot; this was not a collaboration on eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here are the images , the text described merely . &quot; was created by a picture Bible .
for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler from Luther &apos;s publisher , this work is an invitation to deepen his life and find freedom .
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for se@@ ag@@ ull persons both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas Pr@@ ints - is presented for the first time in an exhibition that is opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
construction beginning for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn se@@ am
plans made , place found , company commanded to have ground level for a circuit : one year later almost everything was done - but still before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway was finally finished .
om@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration for ver@@ ings , especially in the living @-@ inhabitants , which did not tolerate the railway .
so hill cutting down , new place sought out - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
the approval I will discuss in October , I was able to inform the first community of Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck in the Kinder@@ - und Jugend@@ liter@@ acy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it then should be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; second &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; memory &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensified engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B is expanding its commitment to refugees and to 2019 , the Bundesliga is a clear sign in this weekend .
the football responded to the clear situation in Germany and ensures that politics allows its help in dealing with the upcoming problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this for the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there can no one say in principle that nothing is about , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be of interest in the control of each and every single topic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B , Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; I am next Wednesday in the chan@@ cell@@ or ministry and meet the government mini@@ stered in Ms Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will certainly play a central role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football might be able to help and wants to bring .
but the decisive course must place politics .
the German Football Association has therefore expanded its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; in four years .
&quot; via the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Stiftung , we ensured that this program continues up to 2019 , &quot; explained Ni@@ ers@@ bach at the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
also some German li@@ gi@@ sts support this program .
already on this weekend the 36 benefits grant a clear sign when they are on the left tri@@ kot@@ k instead of the otherwise usual sponsorship ( her@@ mes ) to help the imprint &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also want to make clear that everyone should help , where and how they can only , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lever@@ age Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler der &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zeitung ( Tuesday ) and signed the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee @-@ drama does not go away , none must see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want football @-@ state @-@ state , no , we have to use our radi@@ ance , our influence and our potential to help the many refugees that have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
H@@ offen@@ hei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent symbol of the League . &quot;
for EM @-@ qualification against Hungary at this Friday , the team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach had distinguished the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a great &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 roy@@ alties would have started their own projects would be great .
just as great is that small and smallest associations are active there .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; who we have spent , is lived in football .
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
this year the association will be jointly with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government with 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees .

report : SAP @-@ St@@ able loses in an accident
the head of Europe &apos;s biggest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has lost several reports according to a down@@ fall in the beginning of July .
in the event of the accident at the House of his brother in the USA he was midnight by midnight on a water @-@ glass which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; economic week &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he is almost ha@@ em@@ bled , was power@@ less , then came out and tow@@ ed to the road - that he told us so last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ Where &quot; SAP @-@ co @-@ founder H@@ asso Plat@@ ner .
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t might be able to trace his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said plat@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 year old manager was involved in the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; busy job &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday birthday ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to perform the software group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP because , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I was in a regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman H@@ asso Plat@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t com@@ mu@@ te between Germany and the USA , but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP Head@@ quarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal history , said the Manager of &quot; S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important is to stand up again if you have fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

soccer : BV@@ B without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us were finally broken in the first group game of the Europe League .
the national player is missing the championship leader of the Bundesliga . also in the du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 o &apos;clock / sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can not rely on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ck@@ les on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga team against Lever@@ k@@ usen , called the BV@@ B @-@ Coach : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
given the high load of his professionals , Tu@@ ck@@ oo will change his pedi@@ gree not only on the Re@@ us position .
so he announced a change on the door@@ ke@@ able position .
therefore , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of stem from stem Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he exercises on an absolute top @-@ level , &quot; praised the football teacher the World Champion .
whether past@@ el f@@ eller in future be used in all European league games , Tu@@ ck@@ les left her open .
with a high degree of probability , it will also be the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the resear@@ ching statement by fellow @-@ player Re@@ us that the Fin@@ als for BV@@ B in Europe League needs to be the aim of holding mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for understandable : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this makes Marco not so wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think we have a good chance to pick the title . &quot;
Robot@@ er@@ tos : government wants the cutting edge for Germany
according to the will of the federal government , Germany should be fron@@ trun@@ ner in changing the cars of technological background .
the Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the I@@ esse IA@@ A of a &quot; new mobility Age . &quot;
automated and connected driving will improve traffic safety and ensure less traffic , said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t .
he wants to discuss the subject with his presidency from the G@@ 7 states who will also meet with representatives of industry at the IA@@ A .
the strategy paper of the Department of Health empha@@ sizes among other things the significance of mobile broad@@ band installation and rapid conver@@ ters on digital radio .
the testing of new technology is currently creating a test stretch on the 9 motorway in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to allow the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the federal government wants to examine the legal framework , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and where needed to adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use approximately internationally for the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ driving cars from 10 to 130 km per h .
the federal government also wants to use a change to the Vienna Convention which has so far been able to see only man as a driver .
when automated driving takes over the car the guide , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras which capture the environment and process the data in seconds .
after one of the study presented by the Department of Economic Affairs , it will be possible to drive highly automated driving on motor@@ ways up to 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the vehicles are to be expected on public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added value in the range of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the Germany site value the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8,@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital connectivity of the P@@ k@@ ws can lead to increased safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD policy ven@@ erable Bart@@ ol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of the liability in accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clari@@ fied either .
but the Germans are still looking scep@@ tical -- much more than French or Americans .
one on Wednesday in the commemor@@ ative survey of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the EU@@ T @-@ Institute on behalf of the EU@@ T @-@ Institute on behalf of the EU@@ T @-@ Institute &apos;s mandate comes to the result that only eight percent of the Germans have believed that autonomous cars will be able to prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent charged with it , 31 percent do not believe in it all .
in France 21 percent of respon@@ dents rep@@ lied to 20@@ 25 with autonomous cars , in the USA 33 percent .
in any case the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to completely leave on a self @-@ driven car .
after collecting the digital press , Bit@@ k@@ om will only agree with seven percent to take control during the entire trip on all roads .
on the highway , that could be present in flowing traffic by after 15 percent , at the St@@ au 45 percent .
well every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .
B@@ oll said team@@ - and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
the occasion of Düssel@@ dor@@ fer will fight only in sol@@ ation during the title of September 25 until October 4 .
the final decision should be handed down at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough , even without the Tim@@ o said the title , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said German , Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ ner , during the EM @-@ course in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this point , B@@ oll has been at this time on the flight to an agreed @-@ term sponsorship contract in China .
the 34 years old German champion is expected on Friday .
&quot; without Tim@@ o is the disadvantage , we are now no longer as a clear favorite , &quot; stated single @-@ Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov .
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who runs the S@@ etz@@ el@@ in@@ burg Palace , however reminded of the EM 2013 in Sch@@ altern@@ ate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , Tim@@ o has also been missing and we are Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the world @-@ symbol @-@ fifth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English football player Luke Sha@@ w von Manchester United has drawn a serious injury on the right leg .
in the Champions League game at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven , the def@@ ender was taken in a Tac@@ x from H@@ é@@ ctor Moreno and after long treatment changes .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant
it is a mixture of very big fashion show and a growth figure : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich on Wednesday .
the highlights : man@@ nequins , which thanks to video proj@@ ections look terri@@ fying human .
they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , who was with Mad@@ onn@@ as St@@ out@@ out@@ fits to the great star of the fashion scene - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the end of the Haute C@@ out@@ ure , because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it used to be quite simple , meanwhile it is genuine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( V@@ om Civil walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which has changed from September 18 to the Kuns@@ thalle in the H@@ Y@@ PO Kulturstiftung , it is a good fortune that Mo@@ des@@ ch@@ ö@@ ver changed his initially rejected attitude toward a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually , he had been against it , for : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me a exhibition was a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection was already done in the Canadian Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about as much more than just beautiful clothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger Di@@ e@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits provide an insight into the hard work of the man , which has written mo@@ tive history without ever completed an education .
chron@@ ologically the show is not constructed , but it is a beautifully choreo@@ graph@@ ed overall work done , for which much effort was operated : to order the dolls , for example I was engaged in a style sheet .
14 tons of materials have made the creators according to the specifications of the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
shortly before the start of the October , there was still a special Sch@@ man@@ ker@@ l : a leather tro@@ user out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
he always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
even Gau@@ l@@ tier old t@@ ed@@ dy is visible in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ mo@@ ve@@ dic Geh@@ versuche of the designers .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put in his t@@ ed@@ dy bears and clothes , he said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
with a doll to play , his parents would not have allowed him .
after that they have applied fashion , he then himself joined himself .
he sto@@ le fashion shows and saw the dra@@ fts of other designers , such as Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
but later I bought it of course .
for his first own fashion , he does not have to pay the model .
you were given no but were allowed to keep the clothes ...
jewelry instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze as fashion @-@ niche
earlier we went to the long nitrogen machines in and around pl@@ ung@@ ons around , meter .
the embro@@ i@@ dered substances and tips were created in large quantities for customers , which they have for example to have blankets and sheer curtains .
this alone does not work anymore today , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the ra@@ yon skin .
instead the fashion is important again .
in the early times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze mode has played a major role , then the home textile industry was pushed aside - and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : tip in jewelry , with accessories such as pockets and for regional traction .
actually image is the so @-@ called vintage fashion which re@@ jects with past styl@@ istic periods , a rise of order potential .
who does not use n@@ fish in the textile industry in Germany is no longer in the market .
with us , they already make half of all orders .
Mo@@ ra@@ ven Pl@@ auen is with nine other companies a member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and Sti@@ ckers .
only they are allowed to bear the protected label .
approximately 80 percent of the sales have been demol@@ ished in the last 15 years .
there are almost no more private dealers and also the wholesale market there are almost no more .
our products are hardly reaching the customer in this way .
the mass goods will be manufactured a lot cheaper in the Asian region and almost exclusively distributed over chains .
also , the export , currently to Russia and the USA .
enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association tries also to score points by environmental awareness , such as Cord@@ ula Bauer from the nitrogen le in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we conduct a seal of quality that shows that we produce environmentally and socially compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this refers to the used materials . &quot;
graduate manager U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ eberger region of the West@@ Sax@@ on University Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embro@@ ider@@ ies and tips .
to deal with competition from the Asian region , one has to find high quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it arises a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and factories that must be economically viable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to keep a customer base .
several years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter the historical snow @-@ tip new .
the machine p@@ ushes little spots to some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener gol@@ d@@ dem@@ ics in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ d did not inspire him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously I could do nothing with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow @-@ tip for their jewelry .
in an elaborate processes it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify with the issue of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter .
she also supplies to the U.S. , to Australia and to Finland - mainly to customers whose ancestors had lived in pl@@ ush and surroundings and who would like to rec@@ olle@@ ct .
I see my jewelry as the modern ambass@@ ador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
legends can &apos;t be touching , but Disney is still working on a new movie of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
it goes to &apos; Entertainment Weekly , but to be a kind of continu@@ ance which takes 20 years after the first film with the magical nursery .
it is about the experience of the N@@ anny with the family Banks in the Time of the World Economic Crisis in England .
anyone who plays with Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws more than 50 years is still unclear .
but the director is already firm : Ro@@ b Marshall , last with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema .
XI p@@ ushes to open the economy wider for the world
the economy has to open itself broader public to promote growth , President Xi J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group that was commissioned with the steering of reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should use foreign investment and know @-@ how to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for business @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a discussion at the 16th session of the Central Management group for the deepening of a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to promote new ups and advance new momentum and vitality , bring new momentum and vitality , and provide new place for economic growth , &quot; said Xi .
the leadership group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list for controlling the market transition , relaxation of border controls policies , promotion of state organisations ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the local residents system .
after the statement , a negative list is generated , the sectors and companies identified that will not come into question for investments .
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
the initiative is of significance , since it as@@ signs the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , a legally @-@ state business environment assured and open the market more open , the statement said .
the government will also lo@@ osen checks on the powers transferred to the companies and make sure that companies decide how to do business .
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic co @-@ operation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
in the context of an offer , state @-@ controlled sectors to be opened , more areas will be opened for private investments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will manage the legitimate interests of foreign finance and provide better services to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , it is made easier for foreigners to request a permanent residence permit or &quot; Green Card &quot; by optimizing the requirements and the application process facilitates .
the law of lawyers to guarantee , to exercise their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting also Prime Minister Li Ke@@ pl@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Bl@@ oli participated , as announced in a statement published after the meeting .
EU agrees to double a cross @-@ border value in pre@@ dat@@ ory
the European Commission wants to double the limits for mer@@ cury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory and the consumers make it a significantly higher dose of the nervous system .
the consumer organization F@@ ood@@ watch , who prepar@@ es an appropriate work paper of the EU , critici@@ zed the plans sharp@@ ly : &quot; risks and side effects of mis@@ sive industrial and inf@@ ants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt from F@@ ood@@ watch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ midt accordingly confirms the limits of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic grounds &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from a milli@@ gram of fish , per kilo@@ gram of fish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , large car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es have been so strongly exposed to Mercury on the basis of still valid limits , about 50 percent of the cat@@ ches should not be sold .
after dou@@ bling of the limits , then only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ ju@@ red .
in return for this logic , the EU according to F@@ ood@@ le wants to watch the threshold values in other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ gram on 0.1 milli@@ gram mer@@ cury per kilo@@ gram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ood@@ le featured this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because smaller fish @-@ fish , such as car@@ p are mostly listed so low that they already keep the previous maximum levels already today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ab@@ sen@@ ing of Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ r distr@@ actions that helps alone the economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mercury is one of the people of high @-@ quality heavy metal , that has grown strongly on the food chain especially in pre@@ dat@@ ory .
the German government war@@ ns us that &quot; even small quantities are especially cause to cause damage to the nervous system . &quot;
the Federal Ministry of Agriculture is declared on its homepage with regard to the current levels , but that a &quot; health haz@@ ard to the general population . &quot;
Mercury reaches above all through coal col@@ lo@@ tion into the environment .
German coal power stations , according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of Agriculture set up by the Green @-@ Bundestag ( Ar@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ corn more than six tons of mer@@ cury in the year ) , two thirds of the total amount in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish such as in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and surface @-@ sur@@ facing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had cited the paper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March of the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year Europe @-@ wide warnings from qui@@ ties to fish already reported to the most common health risks in the EU @-@ War@@ n@@ System ( RA@@ S@@ FF ) .
