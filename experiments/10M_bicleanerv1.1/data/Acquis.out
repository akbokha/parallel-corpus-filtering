the tit@@ er is repeatedly measured in a suitable medium through ever re @-@ dil@@ ution of the reader .
the tit@@ er is the re@@ zi@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest ser@@ ge@@ vity that occurs in reaction ; the dil@@ ution is calculated exclusively by volume of blood cells in the total volume .
an anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other reag@@ ents that are to be used on object dreams , the activity is expressed by the time that is necessary for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object bearer .
the World Health Organisation for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D reag@@ ents for blood group determination international standards , and for reag@@ ents of other speci@@ fic@@ ity are defined at the time standards .
according to the definition a certain number of international units per mg , or ml , and this definition is independent of the titles that are observed in individual supplements ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of reag@@ ents to blood group determination is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ st@@ ite , which is observed in a series of dil@@ ution in a ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tic tank .
the tit@@ er gives the dil@@ ution of the reduction in the last mix inside a series , at which a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of the reag@@ ents for blood group determination are present ( at the time anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete Anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed as compared to the International standard pre@@ par@@ at or of a state standard in International units ( See Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 @-@ 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .

if a re@@ ship is stored under the manufacturer recommended conditions , its necessary properties should stay for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry dates of a reduction in flu@@ essi@@ ger form according to label is no one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
this is based on the label date for dry reag@@ ents . according to the results of the holding experiments , it is appro@@ ached by the state authorities .
dry re@@ agen@@ ces are kept in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or a vacuum , although in which they have dried , and that is closed so closed , that no humidity can enter .
a dry matter may lose no more than 0.5 BC of its weight if it is caused by further drying over phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ ine at a pressure of no more than 0,@@ 02 mm Hg ( 24 hours ) .
to avoid bacterial growth , the competent authority may determine that the re@@ ship ( or the supplied with the dry re@@ agen@@ ic supplied ) is added to an anti @-@ ant@@ ep@@ tics and / or anti@@ bi@@ otic membrane , provided with the added compound the requirements to speci@@ fic@@ ity and effectiveness .

for the international exchange of certain reag@@ ents for a blood group of blood , they should not be d@@ yed , at least as long as long as an international agreement has come into a single system .
reag@@ ents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities not only to carry out tests with un@@ known blood cells , but also for performing tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity stated in a container must be so big that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests in this protocol .
the Manufac@@ turer Laboratory has over all production stages and controls of the reag@@ ents to perform written records .
reasonable samples of all issued reag@@ ents are so long to retain by the laboratory san@@ atorium until with some probability can be used , that the batch is no longer used .
the reag@@ ent number of reag@@ ents can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) of origin ; some of these represent the most effective share , the others are the necessary remedi@@ ation for the ampli@@ fication of the effectiveness and maintaining the stability of the re@@ ag@@ enz@@ es .
for technical reasons these reag@@ ents are divided into three groups according to its effective memory .
this does not mean that the reag@@ ent human origin contain exclusively substances of human origin or that animal origin contain any substances of human origin .

anti @-@ R@@ h blood group era each speci@@ fic@@ ity can be one of two species that distingu@@ ish themselves through the requirements of which a ag@@ glut@@ ination of hom@@ olog@@ er blood cells is achieved .
with others who are known as &quot; in@@ complete &quot; , a ag@@ glut@@ ination can only be achieved in the presence of certain col@@ lo@@ ids like beef alb@@ um@@ in or with other special methods .
some &quot; in@@ complete &quot; Ser@@ a ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ate on objects , also homogen@@ ous red blood cells which are w@@ asted in their own serum or plasma .
the following requirements for the effectiveness of Ser@@ a to the determination of the R@@ h Group may possibly change when International standard pre@@ plants are available . ( i ) anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ rh@@ o ) blood group ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is obtained from the blood of one or several persons , which are immune by the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h @-@ system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , but not containing human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D .
&quot; complete &quot; Anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a tit@@ er of at least 1 : 32 compared to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent sal@@ ine solution .

in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , the serum is intended to contain blood cells that contain the Do @-@ An@@ tigen .
anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , who are intended for use of screens according to the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , have to be mixed with a same amount of 40@@ - to 50@@ percent floo@@ ding by C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells , within 30 seconds a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completely within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ C serum is obtained from the blood of one or several persons , which are immune by the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ous C of the R@@ h @-@ system .
it re@@ acts with floo@@ ding human red blood cells , which contain the an@@ tigen C , but not contained with human red blood cells that do not contain the C @-@ an@@ tigen .
this Ser@@ a are therefore only specific for the C @-@ an@@ tigen only if the tested blood cells in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent sal@@ ine solution are w@@ asted .
the title of the Anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 compared to C@@ c@@ d@@ de@@ e @-@ blood cells .

anti @-@ E serum is obtained from the blood of one or several persons , which are immune to the an@@ tigen E of the R@@ h system .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ) should have a title of at least 1 : 8 compared to C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on objects under the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and not contained in any form of anti @-@ D ) , if they have mixed on an object carrier with a same amount of 40@@ - to 50@@ percent floo@@ ding by C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells , within 30 seconds a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 30 seconds .
sera speci@@ fic@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ c and the speci@@ fic@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ e can be obtained immediately from blood immune persons or can be produced by mixing of anti @-@ D or anti @-@ E serum .
in a given serum , both antibodies must be effective under the specified response conditions at the same time .
if a serum is intended for use on objects , according to the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ time of all kinds of red blood cells , which indicate a reaction , not less than with the ant@@ aneous antibodies .
anti @-@ A serum is gained from the blood of animals that can be immun@@ ised by blood cells or specific substances of the group A immun@@ ity .
