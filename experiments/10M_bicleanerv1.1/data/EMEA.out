this document is a summary of the European Op@@ portun@@ ities report ( EP@@ AR ) in which explains how the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) has been evaluated in order to obtain recommendations concerning the application of the medicine .
if you require further information on your disease or treatment , please read the pack@@ ag@@ ile age ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or consult your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you wish for more information regarding the recommendations of the CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tra@@ ys ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as inj@@ ected solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B . acting thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( listening or vision of things which are not available ) , mist@@ rust and mad@@ ness ; • bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental condition where the patients lack of patients ( periods are abnormal ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood .
A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy is used for the treatment of moderate @-@ severe episodes and pre@@ vent@@ ative episodes in patients who have addressed in the past to the medicine .
injection solution is applied for rapid control of distur@@ b@@ ance or behavi@@ our@@ al dysfunction when the oral intake of medication is not possible .
both diseases can take the solution to insert or used melting tra@@ ys in patients where the swal@@ lowing of tablets are prepared .
in patients receiving other medicines at the same time , the dose of A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy should be adjusted simultaneously .
this imp@@ aired the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; Neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances which enable communication of ner@@ ve cells .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol works especially as &quot; partial ag@@ onist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amin ( also called Ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole looks like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amin and d@@ op@@ amine , but in lower dimensions as the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter acts to activate the recept@@ ors .
da D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amin is a role in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar immun@@ ity to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , causing the brain or lack of brain , causing psychological or lack of symptoms .
the effectiveness of A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy , repe@@ ating the symptoms of symptoms , was examined in three trials over one year .
injection of injection solution was compared to placebo in two trials in 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia or similar ill@@ nesses that were compared to a placebo over a period of two hours .
in another study , A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy was observed about twelve weeks in 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy and placebo which were stabil@@ ized in 160 patients , in which the man@@ ian symptoms were already stabil@@ ized with A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy .
the effectiveness of A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy injection solution was suffered in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar distur@@ b@@ ance , which were compared with Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change of symptoms of patients based on a standard scale for bi@@ polar immun@@ ity or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment .
the company also led studies in order to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tray and the solution to be res@@ or@@ ating ( absor@@ bs ) .
in both studies with the injection solution , the A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy showed in doses of 5,@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg , or 15 mg , a significantly higher reduction in symptoms than the patients who received a placebo .
in use for the treatment of bi@@ polar immun@@ ity , A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ time studies of man@@ ic symptoms .
A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy prevented for up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo during previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 - or 15 @-@ mg @-@ cans were also more effective than placebo the symptoms of distur@@ b@@ ance and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common adverse events of A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , ac@@ ath@@ ering ( constant movement ) , revers@@ al , nau@@ sea ( di@@ sti@@ ff@@ ness ) , cre@@ amy , nau@@ sea ( advanced storage production ) , s@@ ali@@ al , nau@@ sea ( elevated memory production ) , ti@@ red@@ ness and exhau@@ st@@ ion , o@@ in@@ ability , in@@ som@@ nie ( sleep disorders ) and anxi@@ ety .
the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and of medium @-@ heavy episodes in patients who had mostly man@@ ic episodes and during which the lack of episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in addition , the Committee came to the result that the advantages of inj@@ ection solution in the fast control of increased distur@@ b@@ ance and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with man@@ ic@@ op@@ hren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes with bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when an oral therapy is not suitable , opposite the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . a approval for the investment of A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy in the entire European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of moderate episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I@@ - disorder and prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mostly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
an increased efficacy in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected , although single patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I@@ - disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not detected .
with regard to the larger sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered as clinical factors ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induction is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ al dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurr@@ ence of su@@ icides are one of mental illness and aff@@ ec@@ ologically distur@@ ban@@ ces and was reported in some cases after onset of anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of an ep@@ ide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar immun@@ ity , no increased su@@ icides are caused by Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , inf@@ ectious disease ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease , conditions that applied for h@@ yp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , h@@ yp@@ ov@@ ol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure sensitive drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
3 Sp@@ ic@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which one year or less continued , there were occas@@ i@@ onal reports about during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ole Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis .
if patients treated with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y treated patients and symptoms of a sp@@ ic@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , the dose should be reduced to reduce the dose or to break the treatment .
if a patient developed signs and symptoms developed on a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear a fever without an additional clinical manifest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica must be removed , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
in case , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be applied to patients with cr@@ amp@@ ires in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese or in condition that are used with cl@@ amp@@ ires in connection with caution .
56 - 99 years old with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psych@@ osis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , an increased risk of death in comparison to placebo .
there was however in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to un@@ wanted qu@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events at Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ al &apos;s patients .
hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with ket@@ o socket or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em Kom@@ a or death , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there is no precise risk assessment for hyper@@ glyc@@ emia @-@ related events at AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents treated with direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ia , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in terms of deteri@@ oration of glucose levels regularly .
a weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ens patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ie , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica , with which weight gain is known as tri@@ bution , and could lead to serious complic@@ ations .
because of the primary effects of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the central nerv@@ ous system has been careful if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is used in combination with alcohol or other centr@@ alized medication such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a mag@@ ic acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .
in a clinical study of healthy subjects , a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ ine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected to expect that other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects have and therefore similar doses should be made .
in the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ izing , the joint application can result in higher plasma concentration of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentration in comparison to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 highly @-@ intensive Met@@ abol@@ ism .
if you consider the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefits should have the potential risks for the patients .
other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HIV prot@@ eas@@ ors , which have similar effects , and therefore similar doses should be made .
after setting the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors the dosage of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be increased to the Dos@@ ish@@ height before the beginning of the accompanying therapy .
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 can be administered together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , can be calculated with a direct increase in the Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
clinical studies show doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day no significant effect on the metabolism of the substr@@ ates of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 Methodi@@ x@@ ym@@ orph@@ an ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( War@@ ep@@ raz@@ ol ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
the patients should come to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnant during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol .
due to the in@@ sufficient data base to security during human being and due to the re@@ productive studies in pregnancy , this medication must not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits are clear , the potential risk for the f@@ öt@@ us .
however , in other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica , patients should have war@@ ned , dangerous machines , including power vehicles , including power vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence .
the following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medical @-@ related adverse events ( * ) :
the frequency below the side effects listed below is defined in the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study about 52 weeks occurred in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ inson &apos;s , D@@ yst@@ onie and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % was diagnosed under Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ o therapy .
Man@@ ic episodes with bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance - In a controlled study about 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % was under Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol@@ - Treatment and 5@@ 3,3 % in patients with inf@@ am@@ eri@@ do@@ l treatment .
in another study , over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was under Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ al treatment and 17,@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ time period , over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18@@ .2 % was observed in the treatment of Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ole and placebo where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters found no medi@@ cally meaning@@ ful differences .
enh@@ ancements of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and bro@@ pt@@ om@@ atic were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ al patients , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
regarding the side @-@ side effects , which may occur in connection with anti @-@ psychological therapy , the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ osis syndrome , sp@@ lic@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis and var@@ ic@@ fan@@ falls , un@@ wanted qu@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events and increased mortality with older de@@ men@@ tia patients , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
clinical studies and since the market launch were un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate over@@ dose of Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death sequence .
although there are no information on the effectiveness of a Hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ole . however , it is probably un@@ likely that Hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dosage of value is because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma connection .
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder on the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and a ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a high aff@@ inity to the D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 @-@ receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4- , for ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7 , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ r@@ ener@@ gen and to the Hist@@ amin @-@ H1@@ recept@@ ors .
in the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks to healthy volunteers showed a dos@@ is@@ dependent reduction in the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 @-@ receptor @-@ lig@@ ently , on Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the tur@@ key .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1.@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ens patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ole compared to placebo a statistically significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l @-@ controlled study , 52 % of the proportion of response patients who were involved in the study drug was similar to both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l 73 % ) .
current values of measuring sc@@ als which were defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depression scale , showed significantly stronger improvement than for Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study , over 26 weeks of stabil@@ ized patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia showed a significantly higher reduction in the decline rate which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ o @-@ controlled study , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study at schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia , which included 314 patients ( N = 18 or 13 % of the percentage points ) in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) at an average weight of about 5.6 kg .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with a flexible or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole to placebo over placebo over 3 weeks compared to placebo .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance showed no over@@ le@@ gen@@ ic effectiveness .
in two plac@@ eb@@ o- and active mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed recognition , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed an increase effect compared to placebo which was comparable with lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l in week 12 .
in addition , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic remission of man@@ ie like lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of an bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic pres@@ sur@@ ised , the esc@@ ort therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol found an over@@ le@@ gen@@ ic effectiveness in reducing its symptoms compared to mono@@ therap@@ ies with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study , over 26 weeks , followed by a long @-@ time enlargement phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had reached Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabil@@ iser in front of Rand@@ om@@ ti@@ ol , to placebo superior to placebo in terms of prevention of a bi@@ polar back@@ plane , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ase in the man@@ ie .
based on vitro studies , the enz@@ ym@@ es CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is responsible for the el@@ ong@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ cycl@@ ist , the N @-@ De@@ alk@@ yl@@ ation is addressed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 Cat@@ aly@@ sis .
the mean eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ allow time is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , with extensive met@@ abolic processes using CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and for nearly 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ izing .
in Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ole , there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as demonstrated in a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ ic investigation , patients no gender @-@ dependent effect .
a pop@@ ulation @-@ specific analysis of pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics revealed no indication to clin@@ ically significant differences regarding eth@@ nic@@ ity or the impact of the noise on the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ ic features of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol was similar to patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study of subjects with different grave liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ P@@ ug@@ h class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding the impair@@ ment of the liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and Deh@@ lor@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw ro@@ oting to their met@@ abolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on security sp@@ ic@@ ology , tox@@ icity at repeated treatment , re@@ productive @-@ elast@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and for the can@@ o@@ gens potential the pre@@ clinical data may recognize any special haz@@ ards for people .
tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only for dosing or ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so that they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects generated a dos@@ is@@ cence @-@ dependent epi@@ dem@@ ics ( AU@@ C ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 to 10@@ mg / kg / day ) in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10@@ fold of the middle ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose when people ) .
in addition , a Chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the expul@@ sion of sulph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ate from Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol to the G@@ all of Mon@@ keys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3@@ fold the recommended dose dose when humans is based on mg / m2 ) .
however , in human genes were found at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of sul@@ fate @-@ con@@ jug@@ ate of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ole no more than 6 % of concentrations that were detected in the study over 39 weeks in the g@@ all of monkeys , and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro sol@@ u@@ bility .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dosing , which led to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11@@ x of medium sized Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C in the recommended clinical maximum dose .

15 sp@@ ic@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which one year or less continued , there were occas@@ i@@ onal reports about during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ole Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis .
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder on the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and a ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .

it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder on the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and a ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in an O@@ lan@@ o @-@ controlled study , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study at schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia , which included 314 patients ( N = 18 or 13 % of the percentage points ) in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) at an average weight of about 5.6 kg .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance showed no over@@ le@@ gen@@ ic effectiveness .
in a relative bio availability study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was compared with a 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ole solution in tablet form at healthy subjects , the ratio was between the geomet@@ ric C@@ max -@@ mean value of the solution and the value of tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 Fur@@ thermore , a Chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the expul@@ sion of sulph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ate from Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol to the G@@ all of monkey after repeated oral exposure from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3@@ fold the recommended dose of dose when humans is based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dosing , which led to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11@@ x of medium sized Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C in the recommended clinical maximum dose .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injection solution is applied for fast control of ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with man@@ ic@@ op@@ hren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if an oral therapy is not appropriate .
as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution should be completed and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
to minim@@ ize the res@@ or@@ ption and to minim@@ ize the vari@@ ability , a injection in the m@@ del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep in the glut@@ eus @-@ maxim@@ us muscle is recommended .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) depends on the individual clinical status , taking into account the medic@@ inal surgery or acute therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a further market treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is inde@@ xed , see the summary of the features of the medication by AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y melting tablet or AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y solution to insert .
there are no investigation on efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol injection solution in patients with ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that were different from schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and lack of episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if a par@@ aly@@ al therapy with gasoline @-@ codes in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol injection solution is considered necessary , the patients should be observed with extreme degree of blood pressure or blood pressure ( see section 4.5 ) .
research and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or pharmaceutical tox@@ ication ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , inf@@ ectious disease ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease , conditions that applied for h@@ yp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , h@@ yp@@ ov@@ ol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure sensitive drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .

nevertheless , the intensity of the Sed@@ an was compared with the most important gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study where healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) was used as one @-@ time in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cul@@ ine and received the same Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cul@@ arly .
105 The H2 ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a mag@@ ic acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .
in comparison to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ isation , the joint application can result in comparison to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 in higher plasma concentrations of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentration by Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol .
other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HI@@ V@@ - Prot@@ eas@@ ant inhibit@@ ors , which have similar effects , and therefore similar doses should be made .
after setting the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors the dosage of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be increased to the Dos@@ ish@@ height before the beginning of the accompanying therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cul@@ arly received , the intensity of the Sed@@ an was compared with the most important gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .

110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ al injection solution associated with statistically significant improvements of ag@@ ility / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar immun@@ ity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol injection solution was associated with a statistically significant stronger improvement in the symptoms of ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in comparison to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the observed average improvement of the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS exc@@ itement is with the primary 2 @-@ hour end point was 5.8 for placebo , 9,6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in the analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ gregation , a similar efficacy in relation to the overall population was observed , but a statistical significance could be determined based on a reduced patient number .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) in 1.@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ens patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol ( oral ) compared to placebo a statistically significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l @-@ controlled study , 52 % of the proportion of response patients who were involved in the study drug was similar to both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l 73 % ) .
current values of measuring sc@@ als which were defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ depression scale , showed significantly stronger improvement than for Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study , over 26 weeks of stabil@@ ized patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia showed an significantly higher reduction in the decline rate which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ o @-@ controlled study , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study at schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia in 26 weeks , the 314 patients were included in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of about 5.6 kg ) .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study conducted over 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed study of an bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic pres@@ sur@@ ised , the esc@@ ort therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol found an over@@ le@@ gen@@ ic effectiveness in reducing its symptoms compared to mono@@ therap@@ ies with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study , over 26 weeks , followed by a 74 @-@ week study of man@@ ic patients who had reached Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabil@@ iser in front of Rand@@ om@@ ization , observed , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior to placebo in terms of prevention of a bi@@ polar back@@ plane , mainly in the prevention of a recall into the man@@ ie .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C is in the first 2 hours after in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular injection 90 % larger the AU@@ C according to the same dose as tablet ; the system@@ ic exposure was similarly between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers were the average time until reaching the maximum plasma counter at 1 to 3 hours .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole In@@ jection solution was toler@@ ated by rats and monkeys in no direct tox@@ icity of a target organ after repeated gift at a system@@ ic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which stood in 15@@ - and 5 times over the maximum human exposure of 30 mg in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cul@@ arly .
in studies to re@@ productive x@@ icity after intraven@@ ous application , no safety relevant concerns after matern@@ al exposure , the 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) lay over the maximum human exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( oral ) to security sp@@ ic@@ ology , tox@@ icity at repeated gift , re@@ productive @-@ elast@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and for the can@@ o@@ gens potential the pre@@ clinical data may recognize any special haz@@ ards for people .
tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only for dosing or ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans . thus , they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects generated a dos@@ is@@ cence filter ( AU@@ C ) in rats after 104 weeks at a recommended dose of 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 @-@ 10 times the average steam @-@ state @-@ state ) and an increase of secondary symptoms of female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( at least 10 times the average maximum dose when people ) .
in addition , a Chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the expul@@ sion of sulph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ate from Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol to the G@@ all of Mon@@ keys after repeated oral exposure from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the recommended dose of dose when humans is based on mg / m2 ) .

the effectiveness of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study , which took part in the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters were previously used a anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane ( as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared to a conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el using a conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained ( given in combination with other drugs to reduce side effects ) .
overall , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of 229 patients treated with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane patients to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who received conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medic@@ ations .
viewed only the patients who were treated for metastatic breast cancer for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between pharmac@@ ies and survival .
however , in people who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , referring to these indicators reported that Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane effective as conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained .
it may also be applied to patients who have low neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ en@@ numbers before the beginning of the treatment .
the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) proved that Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane was included in patients where the first treatment had no longer be@@ ats , effective as conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medication , and that it must not be given in contrast to other P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs with other drugs to decrease adverse events .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Ab@@ ra@@ xis Bi@@ os@@ ci@@ ence Limited for approval to the European Union .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane Mon@@ otherapy is inde@@ xed in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with which the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is missing and is not shown for a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ contained therapy ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie ( neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ en@@ number &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or serious sens@@ ory Neurop@@ ath@@ y during the Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
in sens@@ or@@ ical neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y degree 3 is the treatment to break up to a level of 1 or 2 , and with all subsequent cycles , the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies have been carried out with patients with imp@@ aired ren@@ al function and there are currently no sufficient data for recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to sufficient data for in@@ justice and effectiveness .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane is a alb@@ um@@ in @-@ linked nan@@ op@@ ar@@ tik@@ el@@ form@@ ulations by P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could have much other pharmac@@ ological features as other form@@ ulations of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction , the drug should immediately be removed immediately and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment , the patient must not again be treated with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in the patients no renewed ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be reduced to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l , and the ro@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes increased again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function ( Bil@@ ir@@ ub@@ in &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly associated with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane was not detected , car@@ di@@ ale inci@@ dents in the indigenous patients were not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or under@@ lying heart disease or lung disease .
in case of patients after the gift of ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting and di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ emet@@ ika and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ents .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane should not be applied to pregnant or women in the anno@@ ying age that pract@@ ises not an effective conception , except the treatment of the mother with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is ir@@ reversible .
women in the anno@@ ying age should apply during and up to 1 month after treatment with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane a reliable locking method .
male patients who are treated with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane is enrich@@ ed , during and up to six months after the treatment , no child bear witness .
male patients should be advised from treatment over a sperm contamination , since the therapy with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane has the possibility of an ir@@ reversible in@@ fertil@@ ity .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ red@@ ness ( very often ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequently ) that can work on the traffic and ability to serve machines .
following are the most common and most important events of side effects found in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was the most striking hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( 79 % of the patients ) and was rapidly reversible and dos@@ is@@ diction ; Leu@@ k@@ open@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane patients and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
in Table 1 the side effects listed in conjunction with the gift of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane as mono@@ therap@@ ist at each dose and indication in studies occurred ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .

P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli active ingredient that fo@@ ster the inter@@ locking of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli and stabil@@ izes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli by inhibit@@ ing their Dep@@ ol@@ y@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabil@@ ization leads to a Hem@@ p of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vit@@ ale inter@@ phase and the erotic cell functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ ina convey@@ s the Trans@@ cy@@ t@@ osis of plasma components in the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies proved that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ in the transport of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
it is believed that this improved trans@@ endo@@ thel@@ ial transport through the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ umin@@ ati is convey@@ ed and due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( re@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accum@@ ulation in the area of the tumour occurs .
the application of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two @-@ part @-@ blind studies and of 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ized Phase III comparative study .
in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an infusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi @-@ cent@@ ric study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received every 3 weeks a mon@@ otherapy with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , either in the form of solvent containing an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute infusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 229 ) .
when recording in the study , 64 % of patients had an infr@@ ing@@ ed general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ ated metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ al cells .
14 % of patients had no chemotherapy prior to chemotherapy , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ ases and 19 % due to met@@ abolic treatment and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .

neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity versus P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by a degree for patients who lived at a time during the therapy a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y degree 3 experienced , evaluated .
the natural course of peripheral Neurop@@ ath@@ y to Ab@@ kl@@ ingen on Bas@@ eline due to cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of the total @-@ P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute inf@@ usi@@ ons from Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the exposure exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml analog to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 According to intraven@@ ous gift of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration took up multi @-@ phase manner .
the average distribution volume amounted to 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume has a far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ cular distribution and / or electric connection of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study of patients with advanced solid tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ ic properties of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 A solvent @-@ based P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the Clear@@ ance of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) as after a solvent @-@ based P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was higher ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature about in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue coating is reported that P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is associated with 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and two smaller met@@ abolic ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Di@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed .
after a 30 @-@ minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ gency was reduced by less than 1 % of the total dose of less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates a wide non @-@ ren@@ al cle@@ ance .

this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed a biological medicine is similar , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and it contains the same active substance ( also called &quot; reference practice &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood cells that could occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion of complic@@ ations , if the procedure is not possible and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml should be expected .
treatment with se@@ ap@@ points must be managed under the supervision of a physician , experience in the treatment of patients with diseases , which is indicated for the medicine .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own blood player , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
injection can also be carried out by the patient or his super@@ vis@@ or super@@ vis@@ or , provided that they have adequate guide .
patients with chronic ren@@ al failure or patients who received a chemotherapy should always be given in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per Dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are to control in front of the treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency should be administered during the whole treatment .
in patients who receive any chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ emia may be caused by a ery@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ et@@ in@@ man@@ gel , or that the body is not sufficient to the body &apos;s own Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ et@@ in .
Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ et@@ in is also applied to operations in order to increase the number of red blood cells , thus reducing the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell which has been introduced into a gene ( DNA ) which is capable of converting the ep@@ och of Epo@@ et@@ in al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with administration in a v@@ ein in the context of a main study with 479 patients , which suffered from kidney problems with reference to reference problems .
at least eight weeks , E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o was inj@@ ected at least eight weeks before it had been inj@@ ected either at intervals or even E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicators for the efficacy was the change in hem@@ oph@@ ilia values between the start of the study and the period during the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also put the results of a study before , in which the effects of under the skin was spra@@ yed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at 114 cancer patients who received a chemotherapy .
in the study , patients suffering from ren@@ al problems caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ s were treated in the same size as in those patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients showed that E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o received an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common adverse impact of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms such as sudden , steep mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion .
se@@ ap@@ lanes may not be applied in patients who may be ins@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against ep@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa or one of the other components .
se@@ os@@ amed as injection underneath the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , as further studies are necessary to ensure that this is not triggered by allergic reactions .
the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached that the drug has been provided for se@@ ap@@ lanes according to the regulations of the European Union of proof that the drug has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile like E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , the se@@ ap@@ lanes , will provide information related to medical specialists in all Member States , including information on the security of medicines .

an@@ a@@ mi@@ es@@ ym@@ pt@@ ome and fol@@ lic@@ ations can be different depending on age , gender and total disease load vary , hence , the assessment of individual clinical trials and health insurance is required by the doctor .
an increase in hem@@ oph@@ bin@@ s by more than 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mol / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability of patients can occasionally be observed in patients with individual hem@@ oph@@ bin@@ bin@@ s over or below the hem@@ oph@@ bin@@ bin@@ - target concentration .
in view of these hem@@ oph@@ bin@@ aries , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should reach 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
if the hem@@ og@@ gy value exceeds by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mol / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ gy value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , the ep@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be monitored m@@ esh@@ ed to ensure that ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa is required in the lowest approved dose which is necessary for control of an@@ emia and an@@ tics .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with the initially very low h@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mol / l ) may require higher yield doses as patients where the initial an@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mol / l ) .

6 The recommended dosage is 600 mg / kg of ep@@ et@@ al@@ fa , which should be given once weekly for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the surgery and the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
in this case , ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa should be pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 mg / kg each 10 consecutive days , on the day of the surgery as well as 4 days directly .

8 For patients with chronic ren@@ al failure should not exceed the upper limit of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration under Section 4.2 .
in clinical studies , an increased mortality rate and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ ese stimul@@ ating agents ( ESA ) has been given with a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ - target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
controlled clinical studies did not have any significant benefit that is due to the gift of ep@@ ist@@ inen , when the hem@@ oph@@ bin@@ ocular concentration is necessary to increase blood trans@@ fusion and avoi@@ ding blood trans@@ fusion .
the hem@@ og@@ ation @-@ rise should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mol / l ) per month to minim@@ ize the risk of an increase in hyper@@ tension .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al failure and clin@@ ically evi@@ d@@ enter cor@@ on@@ ary heart failure or dust @-@ suff@@ iciency should not be exceeded under section 4.2 the upper limit of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ emia with Epo@@ et@@ al@@ fa in adults with kidney failure , which are not di@@ aly@@ sed , the ren@@ al failure is not accelerated .
in tumour patients under chemotherapy it should be considered a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between Epo@@ et@@ ine @-@ al@@ fa gift and the ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in @-@ answer ( patients that may be trans@@ missible . )
if the h@@ b increase is exceeded 1 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mol / l ) per month or a h@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mol / l ) , the dose must minim@@ ize the risk for possible thro@@ mb@@ otic events ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chem@@ o@@ therap@@ y@@ stim@@ ulated an@@ emia - dose value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision for application of combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit risk reduction under involvement of the respective patients who should also consider the specific clinical context .
in patients who are planned for a larger elec@@ trol@@ y@@ tic procedure , if possible , at the beginning of the Epo@@ et@@ ine @-@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ emia is examined and treated accordingly .
patients who submit themselves to a larger elec@@ trol@@ y@@ tic procedure should receive an adequate risk for thro@@ mb@@ otic and vas@@ cular diseases , especially with a lying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it can not be excluded , that in treatment with Epo@@ et@@ al@@ fa for patients with an output level of &gt; 13 g / dl , an increased risk of postoperative thro@@ mb@@ otic / vas@@ cular events may exist .
in several controlled studies it was not detected for ep@@ ilep@@ sy , that they reduce the overall survival in tumour patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ emia .

about thro@@ mb@@ otic , vas@@ cular events such as my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ectious disease ( brain bleeding ) , trans@@ it@@ or@@ ic attacks , pul@@ mon@@ ic thro@@ mb@@ osis , ar@@ ne@@ ural thro@@ mb@@ osis and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidney disease was reported in patients under Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in treatment , so also patients under ep@@ et@@ al@@ fa .
the most common adverse impact during the treatment with Epo@@ et@@ al@@ fa is a dos@@ an increase of blood pressure or deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
an increased incidence of thro@@ mb@@ oph@@ cular events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients with ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ines .

survival and tumor risk were examined in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were randomised controlled trials and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between the patients with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in treated patients and controls .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in @-@ treated patients with an@@ emia due to various more common mal@@ ign@@ omes , statistically significant greater mortality than the controls .
overall survival in studies could not be explained by differences in incidence of thro@@ mb@@ osis and associated complic@@ ations with re@@ combin@@ ated human path@@ o@@ gens in treated patients and controls satisfactory .
it is an elevated risk for th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ic events in tumor @-@ patients who are treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in , and a negative effect on the overall survival can &apos;t be excluded .
it is not clari@@ fied how far this results have been treated to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in in tumor @-@ patients who were treated with chemotherapy with the aim to transfer a hem@@ oph@@ bin@@ s under 13 g / dl , as few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
ep@@ ist@@ in @-@ al@@ fa provisions after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a somewhat extended half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection the serum levels of ep@@ et@@ al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels , which are achieved after intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain equal , regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .

A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is applied to the treatment of the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease which constitutes the bones ) both with women and male and male .
it is applied in patients with a high fra@@ cture risk ( bone fol@@ ks ) , including in patients who had recently suffered a low @-@ trau@@ matic stro@@ kes as during h@@ un@@ any ; • Mor@@ o Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease which changed the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with morph@@ ing Pa@@ get at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip fra@@ cture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of Par@@ ac@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means of inflamm@@ ation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can reduce the symptoms in three days following the infusion of infusion , such as fever , muscle pain , gri@@ pp@@ y similar symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches .
for the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must be prescribed by doctors that have experience in the treatment of these disease .
since the drug in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in Z@@ ometric , a part of the data material is used for Z@@ ometric &apos;s evaluation of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
in the first study , nearly 8 000 elderly women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and it was investigated by the number of verteb@@ rates and hip fra@@ c@@ tures over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who recently had a hip fra@@ cture ; the number of fra@@ c@@ tures were examined over a period of up to five years .
in Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies in a total of 357 patients and compared to other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate in six months .
the main indicators for the effectiveness was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( enzyme , bone sub@@ lime builds ) in blood again norm@@ alized or decreased at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women the risk of sp@@ ine fra@@ c@@ tures in patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( excluding any oste@@ opor@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ ents ) over a period of three years compared to placebo by 70 % .
in comparison of all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without any oste@@ opor@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ cal ) associated with those under Placebo , the risk of hip fra@@ c@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hip fra@@ cture had 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a a fra@@ cture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after the infusion and are less frequent on repeated inf@@ usi@@ ons .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be applied in patients who may be ins@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ ata or one of the other components .
like with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to inf@@ usi@@ ons@@ at and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( die from bone tissue ) in j@@ aws .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a presents re@@ conn@@ aissance materials for physi@@ op@@ osis , which contains A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as a similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medication should be explained and noted when they should contact the doctor .

in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hill , the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended for two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hip fra@@ cture ( see Section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should be prescribed by doctors that have experience in the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a a long @-@ emis@@ si@@ vity period was observed in patients suffering from therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure an adequate supply of calcium , equivalent to at least 500 mg elem@@ ental calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently cut low @-@ trau@@ matic hill , an initial dose of 50.000 to 12@@ 5.000 i.e. or@@ ised or in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended in front of the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a infusion .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can be reduced by the gift of Par@@ ac@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the use of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
patients with kidney function ( see Section 4.4 ) In patients with a Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended as a limited clinical experience for this patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bio availability , distribution and elim@@ ination with older patients similar to younger .
children and adolescents A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age , as data for in@@ justice and efficacy .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) not recommended for this patient population only limited clinical experiences .
an existing mort@@ al premium is before the beginning of therapy with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a due to adequate supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
because of the rapid integration of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure , a temporary , under sympt@@ om@@ atic mort@@ ar can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.8 ) .

for patients who need dental inter@@ ventions there are no data available whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ onate to reduce the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sen in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the treated doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of any patient and based on an individual value @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can be reduced by the gift of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( see Section 4.2 ) .
the frequency of serious adverse events reported in patients who received A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 852 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ ian fra@@ cture trial &#91; RF@@ T &#93; ) , the total hardness of occurr@@ ence between A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occas@@ i@@ onal ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) un@@ wanted medication effects are listed in Table 1 .
kidney function of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid has been associated with ren@@ al dysfunction ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases referred to as acute kidney failure .
the alter@@ ation of the Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured in front of the administration ) and the appearance of kidney failure and a restricted kidney function were comparable to oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of the gift was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a patients over 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the assessment of the laboratory deal , the temporary common calcium values stood below the normal fluctu@@ ation area ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mol / l ) , in patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in a large clinical study patients compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get @-@ studies .
all patients received adequate quantities of vitamin D and calcium in the study on the post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study on prevention of clinical fra@@ c@@ tures after a hip fra@@ cture and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study on avoid@@ ance of clinical fra@@ c@@ tures after a recently crossed ke@@ epers , the vitamin D mirror was not used rout@@ in@@ ely , however , the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the infusion point , such as Roman , sw@@ elling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sen in the jaw area was primarily associated with cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen ( primarily in the jaw area ) reports that were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ at@@ ron@@ ic acid , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
many of these patients had signs for local infections including oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the majority of reports refers to cancer patients based on Zah@@ nex@@ tra@@ ctions or other dental .

in case of an over@@ dosage , which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ cris@@ y , can be reached through the gift of oral calcium and / or an intraven@@ ous infusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ at .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was post@@ ulated at post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( BM@@ D ) and at least two light or a medium @-@ severe verteb@@ rates , or a BM@@ D @-@ T @-@ Score for the pe@@ ach@@ el@@ h@@ as ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing cycl@@ ine .
effects on morph@@ ometric verteb@@ rates A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a significantly improved over a period of three years as well as already after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ rates ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients aged 75 years and over had a 60 % reduced risk for verteb@@ rates compared to placebo @-@ patients ( p &lt; 0.0@@ 001 ) .
effects on hip fra@@ c@@ tures A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a showed a constant effect over three years that resulted in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk of hip fra@@ c@@ tures .
effect on the bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a increased the bone density at the l@@ um@@ wir@@ ling acid , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment significantly ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 % of the bone density of the l@@ um@@ bar sp@@ ine rose by 6.7 % , while the total hat@@ s decreased by 6.0 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
Kno@@ ch@@ enh@@ ist@@ ology At 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were taken after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies from the Beck@@ ary amm .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ograph ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients compared to placebo a increase in the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture .
bone distribution mark@@ er The bone @-@ specific phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal prop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d of type I@@ - coll@@ agen ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum samples were determined in sub@@ groups of 517 to 1.@@ 246 patients during peri@@ odic intervals during the period of study period .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the output value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the output value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the output value up to 36 months .
vitamin D mirrors were not used by rout@@ in@@ ely , but the majority of patients received a initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 i.e. oral or in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before the infusion .
the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on the bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) in the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ RF@@ T study increased the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment in comparison to placebo treatment the BM@@ D at the overall th@@ igh and scar@@ ves at all times .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment took over 24 months compared to placebo treatment to increase the BM@@ D by 5.4 % to the total weight and 4.3 % at the closing price .
clinical efficacy in males in H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ RF@@ T study were randomised in 508 and were evaluated by the BM@@ D after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction of clinical fra@@ c@@ tures in men ; the prevalence of clinical fra@@ c@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated males compared to 8.7 % compared to placebo .
in another study in males ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 23@@ 08 ) , the once annual administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was included in comparison to the percentage change of the l@@ um@@ bar @-@ BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical efficacy of treatment in Mor@@ o A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was studied in patients and patients at the age of 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed Mor@@ ning of the bone of alkal@@ ine ( mean serum samples of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in accordance with 2.@@ 6@@ fold up to 3,@@ 0@@ fold age specific standard value of intake in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in comparison to taking 30 mg of cra@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily during 2 months was proved in two six months comparative studies .
after 6 months , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain was observed in comparison to the initial value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as response during the end of the six months study ( based on the therapy ) were included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and 107 patients treated with risk @-@ up study , the therapeutic concerns at 141 of the patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a compared to 71 patients with risk @-@ treated patients are treated with an average duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application .
one @-@ off and multi@@ ples 5 and 15 minutes of inf@@ usi@@ ons of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic data which proved to be a dos@@ is@@ an independent .
thereafter the plasma level increased rapidly to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase , not exceeding 0.1 % of the maximum value .

the early distribution phases ( α and β ) , with the above t ½ -@@ values , are probably the fast res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and the distinction of the kidneys .
in the first 24 h , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose in ur@@ ine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue .
the total body @-@ cle@@ ance is independent of the dose 5.@@ 04 ± 2,5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the acceptance of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic concentration by 30 % at the end of the infusion , but had no effect on the surface below the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a di@@ min@@ ed Clear@@ ance by Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ En@@ z@@ ym@@ ic systems is un@@ likely to met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zes because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed , because they are a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible inhibit@@ or inhibit@@ or of P@@ 450@@ -

this results in fact that a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al impact absorption up to 35 ml / min requires no dose adjustment of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
due to severe kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ - Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) , only restricted data are possible for this population .
acute tox@@ icity The highest non @-@ let@@ al intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous dose amounted to 10 mg / kg of body weight and with rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight .
in studies of dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the 6@@ fold of the recommended human therapeutic exposure ) is administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influ@@ encing .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public . this document is a summary of the European Op@@ portun@@ ities report ( EP@@ AR ) , in which the Committee of Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) has been evaluated in order to obtain recommendations concerning the application of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used for treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) in patients ( particularly overweight patients ) , where Met@@ form@@ in ( a diabet@@ ic medicine ) is not shown . • It can be applied together with another diabet@@ ic medicine ( Du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , the met@@ form@@ in alone can not be adjusted alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ due material or ins@@ ulin , the previous dose of sulph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ates or ins@@ ulin can be retained in combination with h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar level ) ; this should be reduced to the dose of sulph@@ yl@@ har@@ dening or ins@@ ulin .
this means that the body &apos;s own ins@@ ulin can be util@@ ized even better and the blood sugar level is reduced , which can be adjusted to type 2 diabetes .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of acet@@ tos was investigated in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sulph@@ yl@@ ating material , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in studies the concentration of a substance was measured in the blood ( gly@@ cer@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) , which indicates how good the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tos led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which allows the blood sugar values to be reduced by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional gift of acet@@ ate for existing treatment with Met@@ form@@ in and a sulph@@ yl@@ har@@ lot in a decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of placebo resulted in a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and ins@@ ulin was examined in 289 patients , patients receiving acet@@ one in addition to ins@@ ulin , a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.14 % in the patients who had to placebo in addition .
the most common adverse events in connection with Ac@@ tos were vision@@ aries , infections of the upper respiratory system ( cold ) , weight gain and hypo@@ esth@@ esia ( reduced sensitivity to maturity ) .
Ac@@ tos may neither be applied in patients either to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or one of the other ingredients react , even in patients with liver problems , cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency or diabet@@ ic cookies ( high til@@ t levels - acidity - in the blood ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ counts should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with Met@@ form@@ in in patients where Met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
October 2000 the European Commission granted the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for placing an account in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white to white , round , curved and wear on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS &quot; .
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ adequate , and in which Met@@ form@@ in is not suitable for contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility ( see section 4.4 ) .
for application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age are not available , therefore the application is not recommended in this age group .
in patients suffering from the presence at least one risk factor ( e.g. previous heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , a de@@ comp@@ ress@@ ful heart failure should begin to increase the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose continuously .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , weight gain , or e@@ de@@ me , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve .
patients should follow signs and symptoms of a cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , weight gain and eyel@@ ids are observed when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is used in combination with ins@@ ulin .
a cardiovascular out@@ comes study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced advanced mac@@ ular disease was performed .
in this study showed an increase in reports about heart failure , which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver values ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard area , the liver enz@@ ym@@ es are as soon as possible .
if a patient is developed that point to a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as non @-@ explan@@ atory nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , th@@ inn@@ it@@ less@@ ness , fatigue , appet@@ ite and / or dar@@ ker Har@@ n , are the liver enz@@ ym@@ es .
the decision whether the treatment of patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one should be continued until the occurr@@ ence of the laboratory parameters will be derived from clinical assessment .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a dos@@ is@@ dependent weight gain has been demonstrated , which can stir by fat deposits and is connected in some cases with a fluid resistance .
as a result of a hem@@ ost@@ l@@ ation in the therapy with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a reduced reduction in the mean hem@@ oph@@ ilia ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in comparative studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients with met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ s by 3 @-@ 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 3 @-@ 4 % and ins@@ ulin ( relative reduction in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ s by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of the increased ins@@ ulin @-@ sensitivity , the Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ ac@@ on as a oral two or triple combination therapy with ins@@ ulin @-@ combination therapy with ins@@ ulin , the risk of a dos@@ si@@ dependent h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia .
after the introduction of Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ an treatment , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ ac@@ on , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ ac@@ on , was reported on a decline or deteri@@ oration of a diabet@@ ic mac@@ ular unit with a reduction of visual acuity .
it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between the taking of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the occurr@@ ence of Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ men , but patient should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a ; an appropriate ophthalm@@ ological purpose should be considered in consideration .
in a summary analysis of messages un@@ wanted events as a randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on .
the standardized fra@@ cture @-@ incidence was 1.9 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one treated women and 1.1 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years with women who were treated with a comparative medical medication .
in the pro@@ active study , a study about 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , fra@@ c@@ tures in 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) were treated with patients who were treated with a comparative study .
the patients should be aware of a pregnancy , and if a patient wishes to take a pregnancy or the treatment ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies on the investigation of the inter@@ actions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , phenol pro@@ cou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
inter@@ actions with medicines that met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zes of these enz@@ ym@@ es are met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed , Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ kan@@ al@@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ er are not expected .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with the fibro@@ sis ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8- In@@ hibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induction door ) resulted in a reduction of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due primarily due to treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on which reduces hyper@@ ins@@ ulin and increased ins@@ ulin resistance and increased ins@@ ulin resistance and thus reducing the availability of met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ate growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( from this data is not estimated ) .
these lead to a temporary change of the tower and the refra@@ ctive index of lens , as they are observed in other h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia substances .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ st@@ iege appeared over the three times the upper limit of the standardis@@ ation area as often as placebo , but more rarely than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sulph@@ yl@@ har@@ ness .
in an out@@ come study in patients with advanced advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease the frequency of a severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency was 1.6 % higher than under placebo if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one bz@@ w .
since the market launch , rarely over heart failure in Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has been reported , however , when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reported in combination with ins@@ ulin or patients with cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency in the An@@ am@@ ese .
it was a summary analysis of messages un@@ wanted events as a randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one treated groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients treated with a comparative study group .
over a period of 3.5 years of current pro@@ active study , fra@@ c@@ tures in 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) were treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one patients , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days had no symptoms .
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one seems to work with activation specific kernel receptor ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ liferation of the Rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ) , which leads to an increased ins@@ ulin @-@ sensitivity of liver , grease and sk@@ el@@ etal mus@@ cular cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose use in case of ins@@ ulin resistant .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d as mon@@ otherapy was carried out more than two years to investigate the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment ) .
after two years after the onset of therapy a blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) was maintained by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one at 69 % of the patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study about 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was discontinued in spite of three im@@ pregn@@ ation phase with ins@@ ulin , to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continue to use ins@@ ulin ; a reduction of ins@@ ulin @-@ dosage in the group treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was observed .
clinical trials over one year showed a statistically significant decline in the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ ent in comparison to the output values .
the effect of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( mono@@ therap@@ ies with 45 mg versus Plaz@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week analysis of type 2 diabet@@ ics .
in most clinical studies , compared to placebo a reduction of the total plasma tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des and the free fatty acids and a rise of HD@@ L@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel and mar@@ gin@@ ally , however , clin@@ ically increased LD@@ L@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel .
in clinical studies over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ ac@@ on compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d the total pl@@ as@@ mat@@ ri@@ gly@@ ca@@ des and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol .
compared to placebo , no statistically significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol was detected , while under met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d reduced values .
in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not only reduced the tri@@ glyc@@ eride level , but also improved tri@@ glyc@@ eride level , this is both a effect on the tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ d absorption as well as to the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
in the pro@@ active study , a cardiovascular disease study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and existing advanced mac@@ ular mac@@ ular disease were random@@ ized in addition to existing anti@@ diabet@@ ic and cardiovascular therapy either with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo .
after or@@ ally application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ ac@@ az@@ on is res@@ or@@ ated quickly , whereby the peak concentrations in plasma has been achieved in plasma for 2 hours after application .
based on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV corresponds to efficacy in about three times the efficacy of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics or pharmaceutical dynamic of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , phenol pro@@ cou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with the fibro@@ sis ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 In@@ hibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 In@@ hibit@@ ors ) increases the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( see Section 4.5 ) .
according to the or@@ derly use of radio@@ active ingredient Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , the mark@@ er was found mainly in the case ( 55 % ) and to a lower extent in Har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the medium plasma @-@ elim@@ ination period of un@@ changeable Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours while the entire active met@@ abolic ites is 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its met@@ abolic diseases are lower than in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers . however , the rates of the oral cle@@ ance of the womb are similar .
in tox@@ ic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys , after repeated the plasma volume magni@@ fication with hem@@ ost@@ l@@ ution , an@@ emia and rever@@ si@@ bly ec@@ cent@@ ric cardi@@ ac t@@ rophy .
this is due primarily due to treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on which reduces hyper@@ ins@@ ulin and increased ins@@ ulin resistance and increased ins@@ ulin resistance and thus reducing the availability of met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ate growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) were induced by hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( with male rats ) of the ure@@ bl@@ az@@ an epi@@ thel@@ ium .
in a animal @-@ model of family om@@ at@@ ous poly@@ pos@@ is ( FA@@ P ) , treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ an resulted in an elevated frequency of colonies .

in another study about two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d were examined .
clinical trials over 1 year showed a statistically significant decline in the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ ent in comparison to the output values .
in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not only reduced the so@@ ber tri@@ glyc@@ eride level , but improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ ath increased tri@@ glyc@@ eride level , this is both a effect on the Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ cer@@ eri@@ d absorption as well as to the h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eri@@ d synthesis .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was able to produce a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pan@@ cre@@ as can not produce ins@@ ulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is not able to use the ins@@ ulin .
after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cer@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured that shows how good the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mir@@ r@@ els that it noted that blood sugar levels were similar to the other human@@ ins@@ ulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied in patients who do possibly react sensiti@@ vely ( allergic ) to human ins@@ ulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , the cans of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may also be adapted when combined with a number of other medicines ( the full list is to be found on blood sugar ) .
the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane affects the risks of diabetes in the treatment of diabetes .
October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S approval for the approval of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who have already had signs of Crystal deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflamm@@ ation in the joints ) or tox@@ ins ( &quot; stones &quot; d. h . bigger u@@ rats that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ inary cleaning has been increased after two to four weeks or more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter , the dose may be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months , gyp@@ sum may still occur ; therefore the patient is at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic even further medicines for prevention of tox@@ ins .
the drug is not recommended for children and patients who had a transplan@@ tation , since it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study conducted on 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different Aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to placebo ( one day , 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) compared to placebo ( hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia treatment ) .
in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied to 300 mg once daily ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg a day .
main indicators for the efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary cleaning in the blood was below 6 mg / d@@ dl ) .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 from 262 ) of patients who had Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg of income , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of the patients who once a daily dose of 120 mg in the last three measurements showed a ure@@ tic level in the blood of under 6 mg / d@@ dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of the patient under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , and in no one of the 134 patients with placebo .
the most common adverse events of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , nau@@ sea ( Nau@@ sea ) , skin r@@ ash and abnormal liver values .
in particular in patients with cardi@@ ac ab@@ normal@@ ities , possibly a increased risk of certain side effects , which affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was able to reduce the ur@@ inary tract in the blood more effective than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of effects in connection with the heart and blood vessels .

the decrease of the ser@@ um@@ har@@ sh acid to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mol / l ) was observed at the doctor &apos;s visit in week 2 and permanently maintained throughout the treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum incre@@ ment values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .

AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was the primary efficacy point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there was no clin@@ ically significant differences regarding the percentage of the percentage of serum levels in subjects , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney dysfunction ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub @-@ group of patients with serum hard acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / d@@ dl about 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ act study ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data collected in two years the open extension study of phase 3 showed that less than 3 % of patients required in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients required no treatment against a gyp@@ sum ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the gyp@@ sum size , which in 54 % of patients had a complete dis@@ appearance of gi@@ fted no@@ des up to month 24 .
increased TS@@ H@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ e@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in open long @-@ term renewal studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under plasma concentration time ( AU@@ C ) from Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at after administration is sim@@ pler and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg is observed for Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at an increase in AU@@ C , which is greater than the dos@@ is@@ proportional increase .
after taking a simple or multi@@ pler doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µg / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5,3 µg / ml .
however , no clinical significant change in the percentage decrease was observed , unless this was checked ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are brood ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause , where a risk of a low vitamin D mirror is used .
the patient must use the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drink or use of other drugs ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and Vit@@ am@@ amine supplement ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must not take place after the first dietary supplement of the day at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at and vitamin D3 already are used separately in phar@@ maceuticals which are approved in the European Union , the company set data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also resulted in a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to detect the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing vitamin D mirrors .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment the proportion of patients with low vitamin D mirrors were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , less ( 11 % ) than those who only were only Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( 32 % ) .
the company also submitted data to that the al@@ ert dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose which is needed for preventing a bone loss .
the most common adverse events ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , pain , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( digest@@ ive disorders ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( di@@ arr@@ he@@ a ) , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( di@@ arr@@ he@@ a ) , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( di@@ arr@@ he@@ a ) , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( pun@@ cture ) , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( pun@@ cture ) , infl@@ amed abdom@@ en ( puff@@ ed belly ) as well as suction pun@@ c@@ turing .
in patients with any sensitivity ( allerg@@ y ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D3 or one of the other components can not be used AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
it may not be applied to illness of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who can stand upright or sit in at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of drugs ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and Vit@@ amine supplement ) for the day .
the following critics are to be accurate to reduce the risk of mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and thus linked adverse events ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be used only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patient should not cr@@ ust the tablet , because a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ ale ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patient should not take place before the first dietary supplement of the day , which should take place at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. p@@ ep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ oplast@@ y , only under special caution are given ( see section 4.3 ) .

3 The risk of severe mal@@ op@@ ted side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or after the occurr@@ ence of symptoms which refer to a mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al Ir@@ rit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosing assign@@ ments are related to the patient and to be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .

the clinical evaluation by the treated doctor is decisive for the treatment of therapy in each patient based on an individual value @-@ risk assessment .
the patients are to be instructed by taking the dosage of a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE to take the tablet into the next morning after they had not@@ ice@@ ably not@@ ices .

Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate food and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some or@@ ale medicines may affect res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at if they are taken at the same time .
therefore , patients have to wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at least 30 minutes before deduc@@ ting other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .

un@@ agra@@ f is administered adult patients , to which a kidney or liver has been transplan@@ ted to prevent a po@@ uring of the transplan@@ tation by the immune system .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft has already been used in the EU , the company has submitted the results from previously carried out studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and data published in published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with ren@@ aissance transplan@@ tation , whereby the application was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicators of efficacy was the number of patients with which transplan@@ tation was cancelled after a treatment period of one year ( by example , as often a renewed organ transplan@@ tation or a res@@ eller of di@@ aly@@ sis needed ) .
in addition , more recent studies were performed in 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and examined how Adv@@ agra@@ f is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

only doctors that are familiar with immun@@ oph@@ onic therapy and treatment of transplan@@ tations , this medication should be allocated or changes in immun@@ oph@@ onic therapy .
due to clinical @-@ relevant differences of system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to gra@@ ft im@@ per@@ ation or an increased incidence of adverse events , including lower or over@@ immune diseases .
patients should always keep the same tac@@ kling climate formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; orders of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under the eng@@ age control of one in transplan@@ tation ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
in a consequence of a switch to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and corresponding dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains .
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should be based on clinical assessment of waste po@@ uring and tolerance in detail and on blood levels ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
after migration from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f the tac@@ tile valley should be controlled in front of the conversion and over two weeks after conversion .
on Day 4 the system@@ ic exposition was measured as a valley mirror , with both form@@ ulations both in kidney and le@@ ased patients .
careful and repeated controls of tac@@ kling climate change levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Ad@@ agra@@ f in order to ensure reasonable substance exposure in the immediate post@@ graduate phase .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , an adjustment of the Adv@@ agra@@ f @-@ Dos@@ is@@ plat@@ as can take several days until the ste@@ ady state is reached .
in case of patients during the first postoperative phase , no oral medication is permitted ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an infusion solution ) can be derived from a dose of approx .
duration of the application to the suppression of the gra@@ fts , the immune system must be maintained ; consistent , therefore , a maximum duration of oral therapy can not be specified .
dose recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of the transplan@@ t @-@ therapy should begin with 0,@@ 20 - 0,@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift on the morning .
further dose adjustments can be later necessary , as pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabil@@ ization of patients after transplan@@ tation .
dose recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of the gra@@ ft surgery should begin with 0,@@ 10 - 0,@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift on the morning .
Dos@@ age - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f must be converted twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules on a once daily dose of un@@ agra@@ f , thus has to take place at a daily dose of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , to the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After switching from other immune soup to Ad@@ agra@@ f once daily must begin the treatment with the recommended initial initi@@ ation recommended for the proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of the gra@@ ft .
heart transplan@@ t In adult patients who are converted to the agra@@ f is a oral initial dosage of 0.15 mg / kg / day once daily in the morning .
other transplan@@ t receivers have no clinical experience with un@@ agra@@ f at lung cancer , pan@@ cre@@ as and dar@@ ed patients , in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day , performed in a oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and in a oral initial initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose adjustments in special patient groups patient with reduced liver function for maintaining ble@@ aching reflected in the target range can be required for patients with severe liver dysfunction .
patients with reduced kidney function There is no influence on the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular determination of the serum concentration , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ium and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
conversion of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in on Adv@@ agra@@ f At the conversion of a Cic@@ los@@ s@@ - based on a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is caution ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the mirror mirror in the whole blood The dosage should be based on clinical evaluation of waste po@@ uring and compatibility in detail under the incidence of whole blood @-@ tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ ro@@ lim@@ us controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of tac@@ kling climate change levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic controls during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ Tal@@ king of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also change after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ agra@@ f , Dos@@ is@@ adjustments , changes to immun@@ os@@ ens@@ ity therapy or with simultaneous application of substances that could change the tac@@ kling climate concentrations ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since Ad@@ agra@@ f is a drug with a low amount of Clear@@ ance , adjustments of the dose may need several days until the ste@@ ady state came into force .
the data in clinical studies conclu@@ de that a successful treatment is possible in most cases if the valley level do not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice the valley mirror of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us lie in full blood in the first time after liver transplan@@ tations usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
usually blood concentrations in the range from 5 - 15 ng / ml were used during the subsequent re@@ tention of liver , kidney and cardi@@ ac transplan@@ tation .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft im@@ per@@ ation or other side effects , which can occur in a consequence of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Under@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always keep the same tac@@ kling climate formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; orders of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the eng@@ age control of one in transplan@@ tation ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 In the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft out@@ po@@ uring , which has proven themselves to other immun@@ oph@@ res@@ si@@ va as a therap@@ ist , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ zed formulation of the Adv@@ ant@@ aneous formulation .
for the proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of the gra@@ ft canc@@ elling of adult heart transplan@@ t and gra@@ ft receiving canc@@ ers there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ zed formulation of the Adv@@ ant@@ aneous formulation .
because of possible inter@@ actions which can lead to a down@@ gra@@ ding of tac@@ kling levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal medicine ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ation ) is contained , or other plant protection during a treatment with un@@ agra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of tac@@ kling climate concentrations in the blood has been offered since the tac@@ kling climate of blood can be subjected to such circumstances .
in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f was published as a kar@@ di@@ om@@ y@@ opath@@ y chamber or sept@@ um@@ hyper@@ t@@ rophy , which is therefore also possible under Adv@@ agra@@ f .
further factors that increase the risk of such clinical distur@@ ban@@ ces , a treatment with cork ero@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver function , infections , liquid over@@ load and Ö@@ dem .
as with other immun@@ oph@@ res@@ si@@ va the influence of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to suitable clothing or use of a solar control by using a high protection factor .
if patients , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us take symptoms of P@@ res such as head@@ ache , changing consciousness , forces and vision should show , a radi@@ ological investigation ( e.g. ) .

the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal medic@@ ations known as Hem@@ mer or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may affect the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and therefore reduce the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the tac@@ kling climate mirror with the same gift of substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain exc@@ essive concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strong inter@@ changeable effect was initiated with an@@ tim@@ yk@@ ot@@ ica such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ol , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol , and Vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ol as well as with the Macro@@ lid anti@@ bi@@ otic Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in and HIV prot@@ ector ( z .
pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics studies showed that the increase of blood levels mainly from the increased bio availability of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , due to the inhibit@@ ing of gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal adjustment , results .
highly sensitive pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used in acute deriv@@ ative actions , increase the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood or lower .
effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on metabolism of other drugs tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore the simultaneous application of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed with the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 met@@ abolic metabolism .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us re@@ set the cle@@ aring of ster@@ oid contra@@ sts and thus increasing the hormon@@ es , can be careful with decisions related to health precau@@ tion .
the results of animal experiments have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us potentially decrease the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ one and their half @-@ time leng@@ then .
the results of a low number of studies on transplan@@ t@@ ation@@ als provide no warning that under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us an increased risk for un@@ wanted events in regard to the course and result of pregnancy .

Adv@@ ance is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII , con@@ genital blood cl@@ ots ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application is based on whether the treatment for the treatment of bleeding or prevention of bleeding in surgical procedure is used .
patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency , causing bleeding problems such as bleeding in the joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but is produced according to a method that is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell which has been introduced into a gene ( DNA ) that it is capable of the formation of the human t@@ inn@@ acle VIII .
it is similar to another in the European Union named Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , however , is similar differently , so that the medicine does not contain proteins or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe up to moderate hem@@ oph@@ ilia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the medication was investigated for prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures .
in the main study the efficacy of Adv@@ ance was honoured with the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood cells with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common adverse events of Adv@@ ance ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are Schwin@@ n , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ xy ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
Adv@@ ance may not be applied in patients who may be ins@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against the human t@@ inn@@ acle factor VIII , Maus@@ - or Ham@@ ster@@ protein or one of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted the company B@@ ax@@ ter AG a approval for the regulatory filing of Adv@@ ance in the entire European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy is based on the sever@@ ity of factor VIII man@@ gels , according to the place and the extent of blood and the clinical state of patients .
by the following h@@ äm@@ oral rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor VIII activity should not fall below the specified plasma level ( in % of the norm or in i.e. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and the acute impair@@ ment are removed .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) to repeat until the risk of the patient is over .
during treatment of treatment , the amount of inj@@ ections and frequency of inj@@ ections administered a reasonable determination of factor VIII plasma tor@@ ates .
individual patients can distingu@@ ish themselves in their reaction to factor VIII , different in vivo recovery and have different sem@@ esters .
3 proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ oph@@ ilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 by factor VIII per kg body weight in a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII plasma activities are not achieved or when bleeding is not ruled by a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out if necessary for an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective that other therapeutic measures must be executed .
the administration speed should be set up after the patient , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
education of neutr@@ alis@@ ing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII oriented Ig@@ G Immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are qu@@ anti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by modified Beth@@ es@@ da ass@@ ay .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days are on the largest and of genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ changing days and an@@ am@@ i@@ ar @-@ known inhibit@@ or development , after migration from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product , a different re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product was observed .
due to the rare re@@ jection of ha@@ em@@ oph@@ ilia A in women , there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and nurs@@ ing time .
the A@@ DR@@ s &apos;s largest number of patients showed an inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) which have all previously untreated patients who have a higher risk to education for inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) ( 10 - 14 post@@ oper@@ atively day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE infusion .
blood cl@@ ots was calculated during the whole time and the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirror in plasma and the cle@@ ance rate showed sufficient values on 15 post@@ oper@@ atively day .
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnostic severe hem@@ oph@@ ilia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and prior exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) showed only a patient after 26 exposure times with A@@ DV@@ ATE ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
in addition , none of the 53 pedi@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe hem@@ oph@@ ilia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) was determined by prior exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or .
in previously untreated patients treated with an existing clinical study , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) patients treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII .
the immune response of patients on traces of cont@@ am@@ inated proteins was analyzed by the investigation of antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend and an continued peak of anti @-@ Ch@@ o cell disease , otherwise no signs or symptoms occur in an allergic reaction or a sensitivity .
in four patients the occurr@@ ence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , r@@ ash , r@@ ash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ oph@@ ile Gran@@ ul@@ o@@ zy@@ tes were reported in the frame of the study .

based on the data available since the initial approval of the CH@@ MP , the CH@@ MP has still been rated as a positive rating , but in consideration that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
thus , the CH@@ MP has been based on the basis of safety filter of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which is necessary to apply PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , that the authorisation is supposed to apply another renewal procedure for 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited shared the Committee on Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) , that the company adop@@ ts its application for regulatory approval by Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bone , or the wheat parts ( tissue , which combines other structures in the body , surro@@ unds and supporting ) of it .
it is a kind of virus that genet@@ ically modified that it can carry a gene into the body &apos;s cells .
in the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in , it is a &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus , &quot; which was so modified that there was no copies of himself and therefore cannot trigger the infections in humans .
un@@ ex@@ in could be inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and allow the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein made out of the non @-@ def@@ ective in the human body when using existing p@@ 53 gene , usually contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered .
when Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , the p@@ 53 gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells grow up further and share .
the company put data from a study with a patient in front of the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Cancer in the area of sub@@ tle , in the bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP answers to the Company &apos;s answers , there were still some issues un@@ explained .
based on the test of initially submitted documents the CH@@ MP on Day 120 generated a list of questions that will be sent to the company .
in view of the CH@@ MP , the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ours was not suff@@ ici@@ ently proved to take advantage of the patients .
the Committee also had concerns concerns relating to the processing of medicines using the body , the type of administration as well as the safety of medicines .
in addition , the company had not suff@@ ici@@ ently demonstrated that it can be made in reliable way , and that there is neither the environment nor for people who come in contact with the patient is dam@@ aging .
the company was not aware of the CH@@ MP , whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who currently participate in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ assi@@ onate Use &quot; programs with Ad@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; changed effici@@ encies &quot; means that the tablets are so composed that one of the most effective components are immediately released and the other is released slowly over a few hours .
aer@@ ob@@ aze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic Rhin@@ itis ( loc@@ ust@@ s ) using a allerg@@ y against poll@@ en inflamm@@ ation of the nostr@@ ils ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cu@@ ous membran@@ es ( mut@@ iny nose ) .
for adults and teenagers over 12 years the recommended dose of aer@@ ob@@ aze twice daily is to be taken every day with a glass of water with or without food .
the treatment duration should be as short as possible , as soon as the symptoms , above all the sw@@ elling of the nose mu@@ cos@@ a ( mut@@ op@@ ed nose ) .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medication can be found on the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the most effective measures were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the loc@@ o , which were reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study the patients carried out their symptoms last 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard sc@@ ala , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all the loc@@ alization of the nose , patients , the Aer@@ in@@ tra &apos;s income reported , over a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6,0 % compared with 3@@ 5.9 % in the patients , the P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin alone .
if only the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a were seen , patients under aer@@ ob@@ atics showed a reduction of symptoms by 3@@ 7.4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients receiving des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone .
the most common adverse events of Aer@@ in@@ aze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ ric acid , di@@ vor@@ tex , psychological , head@@ ache , head@@ ache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( ins@@ om@@ nia ) , Som@@ n@@ ol@@ enz ( d@@ row@@ sin@@ ess ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ tra can not be applied to patients who may possibly ins@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin , or one of the other parts , against ad@@ missible active ingredients or Lor@@ at@@ adin ( another medicine for the treatment of allergi@@ es ) are not applied .
Aer@@ in@@ tra can also not be applied in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma ( hyper@@ tension ) , cardi@@ ac or vas@@ cul@@ mination ( hyper@@ tension ) , cardi@@ ac or vas@@ cul@@ um ( over@@ function of thy@@ ro@@ id ) or already have an infl@@ am@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( caused by a brain bleeding ) or have a risk for an infl@@ am@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted SP Europe to approval an approval of aer@@ ob@@ atics in the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it is whole to swal@@ low ( i.e. , without cr@@ ushing , break or cut off ) .
Aer@@ in@@ tra should not be applied using the lack of data to in@@ justice and effectiveness ( see Section 5.1 ) of children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after taking the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time on 10 days , since the long @-@ term application the activity of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin can take this time .
after decline of sw@@ elling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper breathing because the treatment is continuing with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin as mon@@ otherapy .
because Aer@@ in@@ tra P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin contains , the drug is also contra@@ cted in patients who are treated with a mono@@ amin@@ oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or and within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy .
this is due to the alph@@ am@@ im@@ et@@ ical activity in combination with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ves , per@@ g@@ oli@@ d , Cab@@ erg@@ olin , ergonom@@ ically or nas@@ al , phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rin , Oxy@@ met@@ az@@ olin , Nap@@ oc@@ olin , etc . ) .
safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient evaluation and the data is not sufficient to submit relevant recommendations to the dosage .
safety and efficacy of aer@@ ob@@ atics were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function . not enough to submit relevant recommendations to the dosage .
patients must be informed about that treatment in the occurr@@ ence of hyper@@ tension or speed@@ ometer , heart rhyth@@ ms , nau@@ sea or et@@ ai@@ ve other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( such as head@@ ache or gain of the head@@ ache ) must be removed .
in the treatment of following patient groups , patients suffering from D@@ IG@@ IT@@ AL@@ IS • patients with hyper@@ tension ( patients with hyper@@ tension ) patients with a my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in the An@@ am@@ ese , Diabetes M@@ ell@@ itus , bladder , bladder and Bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asmus in An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
Aer@@ in@@ aze takes at least 48 hours before carrying out der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since Anti@@ hist@@ amine is otherwise reduced positive reactions to indicators for skin reaction or in their dimension .
in the context of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , where ery@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were administered in addition , there were no clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions or changes of plasma concentration by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin .
in the results of the psychological tests , no significant differences were detected between the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and the placebo @-@ treated patients , regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone or with alcohol is taken .
the enzyme responsible for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin responsible was not identified , so that inter@@ actions can not be excluded completely with other drugs .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in@@ hib@@ its in @-@ vivo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 does not in@@ hibit and neither a substr@@ ate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
the in@@ justice of the use of Aer@@ in@@ tra during pregnancy is not secured , but experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , does not increase the frequency of ab@@ normal@@ ities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
since the reduction studies of animals not always transferred to humans and due to vas@@ o@@ stri@@ ving characteristics of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin , Aer@@ in@@ tra should not be applied in pregnancy .
however , patients should however be clari@@ fied in fact that in very rare cases , it can lead to a impair@@ ment of traffic or ability to serve machines .
symptoms may vary between a c@@ NS depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ ne@@ e , di@@ min@@ ed mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , Kom@@ a , cardiovascular coll@@ ision ) and a Z@@ NS stim@@ ulation ( ins@@ om@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tu@@ als .

a c@@ NS stim@@ ulation is particularly likely in children , as well as At@@ rop@@ in typical symptoms ( mouth dryer , tur@@ ac@@ ill@@ ary ar@@ re and di@@ li@@ at@@ ation , skin cancer , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , and gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal symptoms ) .
these include the inhibit@@ ing of pro@@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human Mast@@ cells / Bas@@ oph@@ iles as well as the expression of expression of expression of add@@ ressing the P selection of endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measuring sizes , including the ampli@@ fication sub@@ jective slaughter or tasks that are connected to the flies .
in controlled clinical studies at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. daily no increased frequency of sl@@ itting times compared to placebo .
the oral application of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin in the recommended dosage can cause additional sym@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase of blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ arm or manifest@@ ations of a Z@@ NS @-@ path@@ ogen .
there were 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic Rhin@@ itis , 414 patients received aer@@ ob@@ aze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ am@@ ant@@ agon@@ ist efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets , determined using the overall score for sympt@@ om ( except Nas@@ en@@ mu@@ ger@@ m sw@@ elling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy using P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin about the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aerodynam@@ ic tablets with regard to the sw@@ elling effect , determined by the nose @-@ mu@@ ger@@ mination , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy using des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aerodynam@@ ic tablets showed no significant differences in terms of sex , age or ethnic origin .
in the context of a single dose study to pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Aer@@ in@@ aze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is det@@ ectable in plasma in 30 minutes after administration .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ ob@@ aze with healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin was reached on day 10 .
in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ical multi@@ purpose study , which was carried out with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult subjects , it was noted that four subjects Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin bad mis@@ sil@@ ly .
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin is equivalent to the exposure to a aerodynam@@ ic tablet .
based on conventional studies to security sp@@ ic@@ ology , tox@@ icity at repeated treatment , to gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and for reproduction , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin does not recognize any special haz@@ ards for mankind .
the combination had no greater tox@@ icity than their individual components , and the observed effects were generally consistent with the ingredients P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin .
in re@@ productive x@@ ic@@ ological studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin was in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
since March 2007 and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 the Pharmac@@ ov@@ ig@@ il@@ anz@@ system is established and works before and while the product is on the market .

it is also available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 m@@ g@@ - and 5 mg @-@ melting tray ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml solution .
for children aged up to five years the dose is 1.25 mg once daily except in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or .
for children between six and eleven years the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or .
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in eight studies involving about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic Rhin@@ itis ( including four studies in seasonal Rhin@@ itis and two studies in patients who had as@@ thma ) .
the efficacy was measured by using the change of symptoms ( it@@ chy , number and size of t@@ add@@ ling , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies were submitted to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution to insert and use the melting tablet in the same way as the tablets and application for children harm@@ less .
for allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , when the results of all trials took place , the two weeks of symptoms were taken together with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us to an average decrease of sympt@@ om score ( sympt@@ om points ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the acceptance of 12 to 26 % in patients who received a placebo .
in both studies in ur@@ tic@@ aria the decline of symptoms after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared with placebo @-@ treated patients .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be applied in patients who may be ins@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , Lor@@ at@@ adin or one of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the SP Europe to approval an approval for the approval of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .
one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to reduce symptoms of allergic Rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see below section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience of clinical trials for efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin for young people from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic Rhin@@ itis ( appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be eff@@ ected according to the previous illness and can be resum@@ ed and resum@@ ed .
with persistent allergic Rhin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) the patients can be recommended during the allerg@@ y time .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not found in clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets , where ery@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were administered in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study NSC 631570 was not strengthened with alcohol and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
patients should however be clari@@ fied in fact that it can be found in very rare cases that can lead to a impair@@ ment of traffic or ability to serve machines .
clinical studies in various indications , including allergic r@@ yst@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients who were treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events , more frequently reported than placebo were ti@@ red@@ ness ( 1,2 % ) , mouth dryer ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 young people from 12 to 17 years , the most common adverse impact of head@@ aches was treated with 5.9 % of patients who were treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and with 6.9 % of patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multi@@ fac@@ ebook study , where up to 45 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nin@@ ety clinical dose ) were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the inhibit@@ ing of pro@@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en , such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human Mast@@ cells / Bas@@ oph@@ iles as well as the expression of expression of the expression of no@@ hem@@ or@@ oli@@ s P selection in endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in the context of a clinical study with multi @-@ expertise , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals .
in a single dos@@ is@@ - study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measuring sizes , including the ampli@@ fication sub@@ jective slaughter or tasks that are connected to the flies .
in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis A@@ eri@@ us was effective at the relief of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , Nas@@ en@@ secre@@ tion and Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z &apos;s nose , Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z , Tr@@ än@@ en@@ ary and Rö@@ cking of eyes as well as Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z on the pal@@ ate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic Rhin@@ itis can also be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic Rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as the occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as the occurr@@ ence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as a result of the overall score on the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the stress due to seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis .
the chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria was evaluated as a representative for other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the under@@ lying path@@ ophysi@@ ology remains similar to the equ@@ ology of different forms and chronic patient can be rec@@ alled .
since the hist@@ amine imp@@ airs a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ular diseases , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is also expected to improve the symptoms of chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , which is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the percentage of Qu@@ add@@ ling at the end of the first dose intervals .
like in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ per@@ ika in chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not respond to anti@@ hist@@ amine , from the study .
improvement of the jew@@ ellery by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of sleep and wax , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for assessment of these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics study , in which the patient data were comparable with the general seasonal Rhin@@ itis population , 4 % of patients showed a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin .
there are no risk points for clin@@ ically @-@ relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5- 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin responsible was not identified , so that inter@@ actions with other drugs will not be excluded
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in@@ hib@@ its in vivo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 does not in@@ hibit and neither a substr@@ ate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
in a single term study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( low @-@ fat , cal@@ orie rich breakfast ) is not limited to the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin .
the clinical trials conducted by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin carried out in a comparable degree in the exposition of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the tox@@ icity of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and of Lor@@ at@@ adin .
based on conventional studies to security sp@@ ic@@ ology , tox@@ icity at repeated gift , Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and for re@@ productive @-@ elast@@ icity , pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin no particular haz@@ ards for mankind .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals to reduce symptoms of allergic Rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescribed doctor should be aware that most cases of Rhin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see below section 4.4 ) and that no data are prescribed for treatment of inf@@ ectious r@@ hin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory symptoms or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis should play an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , physical investigations and corresponding laboratory and skin studies .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years met@@ abolic des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ata is restricted and experienced a higher substr@@ ate load ( see below section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , fully met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed , is identical to the children who met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed .
this medication contains Sac@@ char@@ ose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with inher@@ ited problems of a fru@@ ct@@ ose @-@ int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance , glucose @-@ Gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ absor@@ bing or suc@@ cul@@ ase inhibit@@ or in@@ suff@@ iciency should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where ery@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were administered in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study NSC 631570 was not ampli@@ fied by A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol the performance effective effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the total number of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group as compared to the placebo group .
in clinical studies with adults and adolescents in different indications , including allerg@@ y Rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , who were treated with placebo .
in a multi@@ fac@@ ebook study of adults and adolescents aged up to 45 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nin@@ ety clinical dose ) were observed , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children aged between 1 and 11 years , who came to a anti@@ hist@@ amine treatment in question , received a daily Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ing@@ dose of 1.25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic Rhin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to children &apos;s population .
in the context of a clinical study with multi @-@ expertise in adults and adolescents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) was applied for over ten days in adults , there was no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals .
in controlled clinical studies at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. daily for adults and adolescents , no increased frequency of sl@@ ender compared to placebo compared to placebo .
during a single daily dose of 7.5 mg A@@ eri@@ us pills led to adults and adolescents in clinical trials , not to any impair@@ ment of the psych@@ edel@@ ic .
in clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , it came to an increase of alcohol not to gain the alcohol @-@ induced power loss even to an increase of sl@@ ender .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis A@@ eri@@ us tablets have been effective in the lin@@ ting of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , Nas@@ en@@ secre@@ tion and Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z &apos;s nose , Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z , Tr@@ än@@ en@@ ary and Rö@@ cking of eyes as well as Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z on the pal@@ ate .
as a result of the overall score on the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets have developed effectively the r@@ er@@ onal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis caused by seasonal allergic
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the percentage of Qu@@ add@@ ling at the end of the first dose intervals .
the spread of this limited phen@@ otyp@@ s was comparable with adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger at Black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ cas@@ ian ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ical parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic multi@@ fac@@ ial study with sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis observed .
the load ( AU@@ C ) through Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was approx . 3 to 6 hours higher and the C@@ max . 3 to 4@@ times higher with an terminal time of about 120 hours .
there are no connection points for a clinical @-@ relevant drug con@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5- 20 mg ) over 14 days for adults and adolescents .
12 In different single dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin diagnosed in pedi@@ at@@ ric patients with recommended doses were comparable with those of adults who received the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin responsible was not identified , so that inter@@ actions can not be excluded completely with other drugs .
A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is available in type III Bra@@ ung@@ las@@ bottles with child @-@ safe polypropylene cone cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .
equipped with a rigid , transparent polystyrene measuring spoon , calibr@@ ated with 2.5 ml and 5 ml or with an application injection for preparations for intake tubes of 2.5 ml and 5 ml ( only for the 150 ml bottle ) .
a dose of A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ oph@@ il@@ is@@ at once intake a day in the mouth , to reduce symptoms of allergic Rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see below section 5.1 ) .

clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not detected in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where ery@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally used ( see section 5.1 ) .
clinical studies in various indications , including allergic r@@ yst@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , than in patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multi@@ fac@@ ebook study , where up to 45 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nin@@ ety clinical dose ) were observed , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ oph@@ il@@ is@@ at was well toler@@ ated ; this was documented by clinical analysis , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G intervals .
in the context of a clinical study with multi @-@ expertise , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold the clinical dose ) was applied for over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals .
in controlled clinical studies at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. daily no increased frequency of sl@@ itting times compared to placebo .
in a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measuring sizes , including the ampli@@ fication sub@@ jective slaughter or the tasks that are connected to the flies .
in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis A@@ eri@@ us tablets have been effective in the lin@@ king of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , Nas@@ en@@ secre@@ tion and Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z &apos;s nose , Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z , Tr@@ än@@ en@@ ary and Rö@@ cking of eyes as well as Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z on the pal@@ ate .

in June 2008 , Nov@@ art@@ is V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially declared the Committee on Human@@ ities for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) , that the company adop@@ ts its application for approval of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for prevention of avi@@ or H@@ 5@@ N1 flu in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be applied to protect against flu , which is caused by the strain of flu ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of influenza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that could cause a strain of influenza , which could cause future pan@@ demic .
an influenza pan@@ demic breaks out if a new tribe of Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus occurs slightly from man to humans , because people still have no immun@@ ity ( not protection ) against it .
following the administration of the vaccine it recogni@@ zes the immune system contained in the vaccine production parts of Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus as &quot; physical foreign &quot; and produces antibodies against it .
this makes the immune system later in a contact with a Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus of this St@@ am@@ ms qu@@ icker antibodies .
subsequently , the virus m@@ shell of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , det@@ ects the human body as body @-@ strange ) , puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine .
a inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the scope of clinical data base was not sufficient for assessment of safety of vacc@@ ines , to meet the requirements of the EMEA for pre@@ pan@@ ic vacc@@ ines .
should you take part in a clinical study and need more information regarding your treatment , please contact your doctor &apos;s doctor .
if you wish for more information regarding the recommendations of the CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years applied to the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which caused the purchased immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who can &apos;t swal@@ low the capsules , the gen@@ ase can not be used as a solution , but this can &apos;t be taken together with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination has not been studied .
A@@ gen@@ ase should only be classified if the physician has examined the an@@ tivir@@ al medicine of the patient previously made , and the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood has made that the virus may respond to the drug .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , taken together with twice daily 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of gen@@ eric according to body weight .
chor@@ oid was reduced in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines the HIV @-@ amount in the blood and keeps them at low level .
AIDS does not need to cure AIDS , however , cannot delay the damage of the immune system and thus ensures the development of HIV infections and diseases .
chor@@ oid was studied in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines , but without R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults , previously not been treated with Prot@@ ocols .
this was compared with low @-@ dos@@ ed r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced medicine A@@ gen@@ ase was compared with 206 adults , which had previously been compared with other Prot@@ ocols .
the main indicators for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ al load ) or the change of vir@@ al load after treatment .
in studies with patients who had previously had no prot@@ ector had been taken after 48 weeks under A@@ gen@@ ase more patients had a vir@@ al load below 400 copies / ml , but A@@ gen@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gen@@ ase also reduced the vir@@ al load , but was treated with the children who were previously treated with Prot@@ ocols , only very few to the treatment .
in the study with adults who had been treated earlier with Prot@@ ocols which had been treated with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced medicine A@@ gen@@ ase the vir@@ us@@ last after 16 weeks of treatment as well as other Prot@@ ocols :
in the patients with HIV that was resistant against four other prot@@ ector , it came under A@@ gen@@ ase together with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger apost@@ asy of the vir@@ us@@ last after four weeks than in the patient who continued its previous prot@@ ector :
the most common adverse events of A@@ gen@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( di@@ arr@@ he@@ a ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , r@@ ash and F@@ atigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gen@@ ase should not be applied in patients who may be ins@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r or one of the other components .
A@@ gen@@ ase can also not be applied in patients , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( a plant preparation for treating depression ) or medicines that are just like as@@ gen@@ ase and are taken in high concentrations in the blood of health .
as with other drugs against HIV , A@@ gen@@ ase take the risk of a li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy ( alter@@ ations in the distribution of body fat ) , an oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( die from bone tissue ) or an immun@@ re@@ activation of syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of an infection that are caused by the recovery of the immune system ) .
the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 in@@ treated adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ gen@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ist Am@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee presented that the value of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have previously not been detected .
A@@ gen@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; because of approval from scientific reasons only limited information .
October 2000 the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited for approval of the production of A@@ gen@@ ase in the entire European Union .
gener@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- infected , prot@@ ocol@@ ehem@@ mer ( PI ) -@@ treated adults and children from 4 years .
for usual , A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are to be given to pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ical booster of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r should be used in consideration of the individual vir@@ al resistance and the treatment of patients ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio availability of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than one capsule , hence A@@ gen@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 600 mg Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
2 If A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are applied without the supplem@@ entary supplement of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , greater doses must be applied to A@@ gen@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines up to a daily highest dose of 2400 mg Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics , effectiveness and safety of gen@@ ase in combination with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ eas@@ ants were not examined with children .
A@@ gen@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the absence of data to in@@ ev@@ ality and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ical data , the dose of A@@ gen@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders reduced to 300 mg twice daily .
the con@@ current application should be done in patients with mild or moderate liver function , patient with severe liver function ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gen@@ ase can not be used simultaneously with medicines that have a small therapeutic width and also display substr@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ym@@ s 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations that contain Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ation ) may not be applied due to the risk reductions and a reduced therapeutic effect of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r during the intake of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be noted that A@@ gen@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy does not lead to a healing of HIV infection , and that they may continue to develop opportun@@ ist infections or other complic@@ ations of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including treatment with A@@ gen@@ ase does not prevents the risk of transfer from HIV to other by sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually A@@ gen@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who are treated in chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy , an increased risk of severe liver @-@ effects with potentially fatal course .
for the case of simultaneous an@@ tivir@@ al treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant technical information of this medicine .
patients with pre@@ existing reduced liver function , including a chronic hepatitis C , increased frequency of liver function under an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gen@@ ase and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ ason or other Glu@@ oc@@ or@@ tik@@ o@@ ids , which will be changed over CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment of system@@ ic corne@@ al ero@@ i@@ der effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the an@@ ni@@ otic function ( see section 4.5 ) .
as the digest@@ ion of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ a Re@@ duc@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly recommended by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of A@@ gen@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin due to the increased risk of my@@ op@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sen is not recommended .

in patients receiving this medicine at the same time , A@@ gen@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma concentration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ abolic inter@@ actions with am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hor@@ m@@ onal contra@@ sts can be changed , but the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of inter@@ actions .
when meth@@ ad@@ on is given at the same time , when meth@@ ad@@ on is given at the same time , the patient should therefore be monitored on O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ om@@ pt@@ ome , especially if there are also low doses given by R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the possible risk factors of a tox@@ icity in the A@@ gen@@ ase solution , this formulation is con@@ ferred with children under an age of four years and should be used with care of certain other patient groups .
A@@ gen@@ ase should be set to duration 5 if a skin irrit@@ ation is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
in patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including prot@@ ector , was reported above the occurr@@ ence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia or an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases associated with their therapy medication which are associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ glyc@@ emia .

in ha@@ em@@ oph@@ ile patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with Prot@@ ocols , are reports about an increase of bleeding including spont@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oma and ha@@ emat@@ thro@@ sen .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with serious immune defect , the time of an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ vir@@ al bacterial infections which leads to severe clinical states or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ t@@ orial e@@ at@@ ology is accepted ( including application of cork ero@@ ids , high Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose in particular were reported in patients with advanced HIV @-@ disease and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) .

CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ate with low therapeutic width A@@ gen@@ ase with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r cannot be used together with drugs whose active substances are mainly connected to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and increased plasma tiles with serious and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to a resistance development .
in an attempt to balance the lower plasma level by a dose of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , they were very often un@@ wanted effects in the liver .

a dose adjustment for one of the drug is not required when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ ditions down below ) .
508 % increased , if R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical studies , doses of 600 mg Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r twice daily were applied twice daily and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which schem@@ es the effectiveness and in@@ justice of this treatment schem@@ at@@ as .
52 % lower if Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg L@@ op@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ ast values of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved during combination of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg L@@ op@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can &apos;t be given , but it is not recommended to ensure a narrow monitoring since the effectiveness and in@@ justice of this combination is not known .
no pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic study was carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , however , due to the ant@@ is@@ ci@@ de component of di@@ than@@ os@@ ene , it is recommended that the revenues of di@@ than@@ os@@ ine and A@@ gen@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see ant@@ acids down ) .
therefore , in combination with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) does not require dose adjustments .
treatment with liz@@ ards in combination with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both proteins would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin to other Prot@@ ocols and existing limited data can be avoided that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin is possibly reducing the serum concentration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r .
if this medication should be used simultaneously , caution is caution when Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced and possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma level .
if this drug may be applied together , caution ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical surveillance shall be carried out , as an exact predi@@ ction of the combination of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r to Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous gift of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ o@@ ut@@ in led to a rise in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ o@@ ut@@ in around 193 % and thus to a rise in connected side effects .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ ak@@ ut@@ in together with A@@ gen@@ ase is necessary to reduce the dosage of Ri@@ o@@ ut@@ in at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data are required .
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic studies with A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with ery@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in were not performed but could be increased the plasma level of both medicines in the case of simultaneous administration .

other medicines , below are listed below , including substr@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may be applied together with A@@ gen@@ ase , possibly to inter@@ actions .
patients should therefore be connected to toxic reactions that are associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with A@@ gen@@ ase .
based on the data of other Prot@@ ocols , it is advis@@ able that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as A@@ gen@@ ase , since it can come to res@@ or@@ ption problems .
the simultaneous application of anti @-@ vul@@ vul@@ va , known as enz@@ ym@@ s are known ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with am@@ t@@ avi@@ r can lead to a decrease of the plasma tiles of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r .

the con@@ current consumption of A@@ gen@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentration and ampli@@ fication with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection side effects including Hyp@@ o Village , vision@@ aries and Pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in the R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µg of fluores@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) decreased significantly more than 7 days , while endo@@ genous K@@ ort@@ is@@ ol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % discount interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous gift of gen@@ ase with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with these glucose or@@ tik@@ it is not recommended unless the potential use of treatment of the risk of system@@ ic corne@@ al ero@@ i@@ der effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
with H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ a @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose comp@@ iling changes strongly of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 are pronounced increases the plasma level in the simultaneous administration of A@@ gen@@ ase .
since plasma level increases of these H@@ MG Co@@ a @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors to my@@ opath@@ y including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ ys@@ is , the combined use of this product is not recommended .
a common monitoring of therapeutic concentrations as well as stabil@@ ization of the mirror is recommended since the plasma concentration of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ yc@@ in and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us may be increased by Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase should not be applied together with oral native Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while at the same application of A@@ gen@@ ase with par@@ ental Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am may be careful .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ cal Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ eas@@ ing inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in plasma concentration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 to 4 times .
when meth@@ ad@@ on is administered together with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ om@@ pt@@ ome , especially if there are also low doses given by R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ ability , no recommendation can currently be given as Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ on at the same time .
with the same gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral antibodies together with A@@ gen@@ ase , a reinforced control of the IN@@ R ( International standardis@@ ation ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or ampli@@ fication of the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hor@@ m@@ onal contra@@ sts is not predic@@ table , therefore also alternative methods to conception .
a careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ til@@ in ) is recommended for the same gift of as@@ gen@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
this drug may only be applied only after pregnancy using the possible extent of utilization for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fet@@ us .

the further development of offspring including fertil@@ ity and re@@ productive capacity was not imp@@ aired by the administration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r to the parent .
the in@@ justice of A@@ gen@@ ase was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
most related side effects associated with the A@@ gen@@ ase treatment were slightly up to moderate , came early on and carried away rarely to treatment .
with many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied if they are in connection with A@@ gen@@ ase or any other at the same time to HIV treatment or whether they are a consequence of the disease .
most of the side @-@ side effects were taken out of two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with a prot@@ ector did not treated 1200 mg of gen@@ ase twice daily .

in HIV @-@ infected patients with serious immune defect , the time of an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) can develop a infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory reaction to the c@@ pt@@ om@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ ous opportun@@ ist infections ( see section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre @-@ treated patients , the 600 mg of A@@ gen@@ ase were observed twice daily with low @-@ dose R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( degrees 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degrees 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) , which were observed in patients who received A@@ gen@@ ase together with low @-@ dos@@ si@@ onal R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .

conclusions for the relev@@ ance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation@@ sm@@ uster can be subject to an additional data , and it is recommended to attract well the current interpretation systems for analysis of the results of resistance tests .
clinical @-@ based resistance tests based clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phenom@@ ena systems can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ical data for estim@@ ation of the activity of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with Prot@@ ective @-@ resistant insulation .
companies included diagnostic resistance tests have been developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ical cut @-@ offs ( separ@@ ations ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be applied to interpretation of a resistance tests .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity against Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r associated genetic pattern creates a certain cross @-@ resistant against R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity against In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data available to cross @-@ resistant between Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and other Prot@@ ocols for all 4 F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al not treated patients with which a resistance against L@@ op@@ in@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 insul@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , l@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 ins@@ ulated ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 insul@@ ates ) .
revers@@ al , Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r reserves the activity against some other Prot@@ eas@@ ing inhibit@@ or isol@@ ate isol@@ ate ; receiving this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in isolation .
early departure of a scor@@ ching therapy is recommended to keep the accum@@ ulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in borders which can affect the subsequent treatment of the treatment .
the cover of the effectiveness of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized adult dose ( 600 mg twice daily ) and nu@@ cle@@ us analog ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , mainly with lowest R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; geb@@ oo@@ st@@ ert . &quot;
one hundred thre@@ es@@ core ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity against A@@ gen@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I have been included in the sub@@ study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis provided the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group regarding the time adjusted average change of the initial value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ corrosive threshold of 0,4 @-@ 10 copies / ml .
the cover of the effectiveness of un@@ ro@@ asted A@@ gen@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gen@@ ase solution used to intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low do@@ si@@ onal R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; majority of patients treated with PI previously had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients included in the study included a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in an median increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) .
19 bases on this data should be considered to be considered for the treatment with PI treated children who are expected to be considered unexpected &apos; A@@ gen@@ ase in amounts .
after oral administration the mean duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r approx . 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % is increased by 30 % if R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r 12 hours of dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore the minimum concentration in the ste@@ ady state ( C@@ min , s@@ s ) was un@@ affected by the dietary absorption , although the con@@ current dietary absorption influences the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent tool volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg ) and can be close to a large distribution volume as well as a balanced penetration of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r from blood circulation into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease of the total concentration of active ingredients in plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound am@@ per@@ ca@@ vi@@ r , which represents the active share , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of non @-@ ble@@ ached Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r remained constant , the percentage of free active ingredients during the dosing scale in the ste@@ ady state concentration on the area of C@@ max , s@@ s up to C@@ min , s@@ s .
therefore , medicines that indicate CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ duce or in@@ hib@@ itions or a substr@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 which are given to be used simultaneously with A@@ gen@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of a@@ eg@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice daily or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .

the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis on low @-@ arms and hands support the effectiveness in this application , therefore a such application is not recommended .
local skin reaction often occur , but these reactions usually take part in the course of the therapy at the intensity or after the treatment of therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if the local skin reaction may cause great dis@@ comfort or very strong , the treatment can be suspended for a few days .
out of the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 acts have been reduced in less than 8 les@@ ions in patients with fewer than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immune stimul@@ ating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ ens@@ itive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .

according to the investig@@ ational assessment of the clinical signs , it shows that in these studies with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream much often with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream very often with severe Er@@ y@@ issues ( 31 % ) , heavy sk@@ ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and too heavy worse formation ( 19 % ) .
in clinical studies to investigate the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ osis Alo@@ pe@@ zie was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment site or in the ambient area .
the acci@@ dental off @-@ off intake of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , head@@ aches , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side effects that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , was norm@@ alized in h@@ yp@@ ot@@ ony , norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous liquid .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ical investigation , according to the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , system@@ ic concentrations of the Alp@@ ha@@ je@@ al@@ od and other cy@@ to@@ k@@ ine were detected .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the effectiveness in relation to a full healing of the treatment in an i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment is significantly superior for 16 weeks of a placebo treatment .
in 60 % of all 119 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated F@@ eig@@ ni@@ as , this was 20 % of the 105 patients with placebo @-@ treated patients ( 95 % CI ) :

the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies where doses are not shown ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or more .
a minimal system@@ ic recording of the 5 % i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis was observed in the three weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest pharmaceutical concentrations observed in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours , and tot@@ als 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the application ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and in the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated half @-@ life time was approximately 10@@ times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ time after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study ; it shows an extended re@@ tention of medication by using the skin .
data on system@@ ic exposure showed that the Res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low after top@@ ical application on MC @-@ disease skin of patients aged 6 - 12 years and comparable to healthy adults and adults with acute ker@@ at@@ osis or super@@ fi@@ zi@@ um bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on the corne@@ al tox@@ icity at the rat carried out doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg , kg was significantly reduced to the body weight and elevated mil@@ z weight ; one also showed a similar effect for four months in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice during the administration of three days a week induced no tum@@ ors at the place of application .
the corresponding mechanism is not known but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a small system@@ ic absorption from human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic , is a risk of human exposure to view as very low .
the tum@@ ors were treated in the group of mice , which was treated with real @-@ proof cream , formerly and in larger number than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place by a doctor , experience in the treatment of patients with MP@@ S I or other inher@@ ited met@@ abolic diseases .
the initial inf@@ usi@@ ons rate of 2 E / kg / h can be achieved if the patient can be increased every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years was not determined , and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended .
safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended .
patients with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients can develop inf@@ usi@@ ble reactions , which are defined as each in connection , which occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion @-@ box ( see section 4.8 ) .
due to this reason , these patients should continue to be monitored , and the infusion of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in a reasonable clinical environment in which res@@ ili@@ ent facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
due to the clinical Phase 3 study , almost all patients had Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , generally within 3 months of treatment of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of inf@@ usi@@ ons , must be treated with care of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .

animal experimental studies can not be found on direct or indirect effects of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since no data of new@@ born that were exposed to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase above the mother &apos;s milk , it is recommended to do not silent during the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
adverse events in clinical trials were classified as inf@@ usi@@ ble reactions , accounting for 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration of up to 1 year ) were observed .
un@@ wanted drug inter@@ actions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , who were observed during the Phase 3 study and older at a total treatment duration of up to 4 years , are frequently performed in the following table following the following skins : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe MP@@ S @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper respiratory trac@@ ts and lungs in the pre@@ history , heavy reactions came up , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asmus , breathing , and fac@@ ial levels ( see Section 4.4 ) .
children un@@ wanted phar@@ maceuticals related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with predominantly serious evap@@ oration form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are reported in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients it was within 3 months after the treatment of a ser@@ ene version , with the patients at the age of 5 with a heavy failure rate ( average daily after 26 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older ) .
by the end of the Phase 3 study ( or until one of the early departure from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients were det@@ ectable antibodies ( R@@ IP ) ass@@ ay det@@ ectable antibodies , including 3 patients who never had come to Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version .
patients with missing up to a low antibody level , a robust reduction in G@@ AG spi@@ ke in Har@@ n , while patients with high antibody tit@@ res was to determine a variable reduction in G@@ AG in Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in the phase 3 study and one in the Phase 2 study ) showed an mar@@ g@@ inal effect on the enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ine activity in vitro , which seemed to affect the clinical efficacy and / or the reduction of G@@ AG in Har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies does not seem to stand in connection with the incidence of adverse drugs , even if the occurr@@ ence of un@@ wanted drug inter@@ actions are typically taken together with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the basis for the enz@@ ym@@ us@@ ation Therap@@ y is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ se of ac@@ cum@@ ulated sub@@ sid@@ y and preventing a further accum@@ ulation of sufficient recovery of the enc@@ ir@@ ation .
after intraven@@ ous infusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly taken out of the circulation and cells in the Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely above Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ at@@ as recept@@ ors .
safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a randomised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 .
although patients were recruited for the study demonstrated the entire disease spectrum was the majority of the patients of the mean phen@@ otype and only a patient pointed the heavy phen@@ otype .
patients were recruited when they had a for@@ ged exp@@ ir@@ ational volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand for 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute sal@@ ads in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were recruited for an open label extension study where they received another 3,5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated with the placebo group an improvement of lung function and the path@@ o@@ gens that is represented in the following table .
in the open extension study , an improvement and / or exc@@ itement of this effects showed up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as shown in the following table .
the decrease of the expected @-@ cont@@ ingent FE@@ V is not significantly higher and the total pul@@ mon@@ ohydr@@ ate increased further propor@@ tionally to the height of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a h@@ ep@@ ic anom@@ aly of treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks a clear tr@@ ash of the G@@ AG mirror in Har@@ n ( µg / mg Kre@@ at@@ inin ) was established , which remained constant at the end of the study .
regarding the h@@ etero@@ gen@@ eous hum@@ ility between the patients , which was taken into account by using a combined final point , clin@@ ically significant changes in the 6 @-@ minute walking test , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
it was conducted an open phase 2 study , mainly the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in 20 patients were examined at the time of their recording in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with the heavy failure form and 4 with the medium @-@ run form ) .
in four patients the dosing was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased GA@@ G@@ - mirror in Har@@ n in week 22 .
in several patients a size increase ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined after the Z @-@ Score for this age group The younger patients with the intermediate form form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the medium @-@ run form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with severe evap@@ oration form only limited or even no progress in Cogn@@ itive development .
in a Phase 4 study , investigations into pharmac@@ ological effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me met@@ ering schem@@ es were carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute test test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the met@@ ering scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks may have difficulties with weekly inf@@ usi@@ ons , a representative alternative ; however it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schem@@ es is equivalent .

A@@ lim@@ ta is being applied together with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ( another drug against cancer ) if the cancer is not re@@ se@@ z@@ able . &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant ) , the cancer has already spread to other parts of the body or spreads very easily to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic , non @-@ small cell lung cancer , which is not affected by the epi@@ thel@@ ial cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have previously not been treated in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in and in patients who previously used other chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , used as any therapy .
to reduce side effects , patients should be taken during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as foli@@ c acid ( a vitamin ) and inj@@ ections of vitamin B12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , should be given in addition to a &quot; anti@@ emet@@ ry &quot; ( medicine against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a fluid deficiency ) .
in patients whose bleeding occur or with certain other side effects , the treatment should be reduced , or reduced the dose .
the active form of P@@ emet@@ ry slow@@ s down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells .
the conversion of P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed in its active form goes even in cancer cells lighter than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations in the active form of medication and a longer time period of cancer cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta was investigated for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ ft in a main study of 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy with their disease .
treatment of non @-@ cell lung cancer were compared to the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease which were previously treated with chemotherapy with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( a further drug against cancer ) and both in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously won no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ plat@@ in were treated at an average of 12.@@ 1 month compared with 9.3 months at the sole administration of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
patients who had previously received a chemotherapy was compared with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months compared with 7,9 months at Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
however , in both studies , patients during which the cancer cells were unable to attack the cell epi@@ thel@@ ial cells during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer than with a comparative medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.V. a approval for the transit of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
every flow bottle must be dissolved at 4.2 ml 0.9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary Do@@ or is taken in the water bottle and diluted with 0.9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is shown in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in for the first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic @-@ small @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al@@ car@@ cin@@ oma ( see Section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is shown for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic colo@@ rect@@ al bron@@ chi@@ al@@ car@@ cin@@ oma ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( CO@@ F ) is administered as an intraven@@ ous infusion about a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment course .
the recommended dose of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as infusion about a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completing the P@@ emet@@ ry - infusion on the first day of each 21 day treatment course .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered in patients with non @-@ small cell car@@ cin@@ oma following a period of 10 minutes on the first day every 21 day treatment course .
the reduction of frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reaction must be given the day before and on the day of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed gift as well as per day after the treatment .
during the seven days prior to the first dose , P@@ emet@@ ry must be taken at least 5 doses of foli@@ c acid , and intake must be continued during the entire therapy period and for another 21 days after the last P@@ emet@@ ry .
patients also need to receive a in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 mcg ) in the week prior to the first P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed dose as well as after every third processing cycle .
in patients who receive P@@ emet@@ ry , each gift should be created , including a differentiation of leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and a t@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ te .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Al@@ anin @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment course , a dose of dose must be held using the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood of blood or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the forec@@ asted therapy cycles .
after recovery the patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA than Mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
these criteria comply with the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 blood pressure .
patients non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ degree 3 ( excluding neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA , until the patient must follow the value before the treatment .
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be canc@@ eled when patients after 2 dose reductions or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - continued at the age of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies have no indication that in patients at the age of 65 years or higher compared to patients at the age of 65 , an increased secondary ris@@ i@@ - ko is composed .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to sufficient data for in@@ justice and effectiveness .
in clinical studies in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min , no dose adjustments required to go out over the recommended dose adjustments .
the data base in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction from &gt; to the upper picture value and / or trans@@ amin@@ as@@ en@@ values of &gt; to 3.0 times the upper limit value ( near liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 times the upper limit value ( in presence of liver metast@@ ases ) was not tested specifically in studies .
patients must be monitored with regard to the bone market , and P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed should not be administered to patients before its absolute neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ en@@ count again resulted in a value of ≥ 1,500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ tes has a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose of dose for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of absolute neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ en@@ count , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ ten@@ se and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles - ( see Section 4.2 ) .

as a result , all patients have to be treated with P@@ emet@@ ry , foli@@ c acid and vitamin B12 as proph@@ y@@ - l@@ act@@ tic measure for reduction treated tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) , the con@@ current non @-@ mort@@ al anti@@ ph@@ ic acid ( &gt; 1,3 g per day ) must be avoided for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ des@@ erve 2 days after therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ es ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients required for therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , the intake of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with a long half @-@ time period must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients , during which these events occurred , had corresponding risk factors for the occurr@@ ence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid collection in trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the ergonom@@ ically re@@ xed treatment will be repeated in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid .
5 severe cardiovascular events , including my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events were reported in clinical trials with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed occasionally , if this drug was usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of existing life di@@ min@@ ates ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .

it is applied for overweight adults with a body size index ( BMI ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low cal@@ orie low @-@ cal@@ orie intake .
patients who use all@@ i should take no weight loss after 12 weeks , should be addressed to their doctor or pharmac@@ ists .
these enz@@ ym@@ es are mut@@ ed , they can not build some fats in food , making it a quarter of the food @-@ guided fats that occurs in the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , all@@ i was compared with 391 overweight patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
in both studies on patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who had all@@ i 60 mg of income , after a year , aver@@ aging an average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg at the intake of placebo .
patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , could not be observed for patients of relevant weight loss .

it may also not be applied in patients who suffer from long @-@ term col@@ oring syndrome ( with which not enough nutrients are taken out of the digest@@ ive tract ) or to cholesterol ( a liver disease ) , and in pregnant or l@@ act@@ ating mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited for the registration of Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union .
all@@ i is inde@@ xed to weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in combination with a slightly hypo@@ cris@@ es , fat @-@ induced diet .
all@@ i may not be applied by children and adolescents under 18 , because there are not enough data on efficacy and safety .
since Or@@ list@@ at is only minimal , is necessary for elderly and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function , no adjustment of the dosage necessary .

the probability of adv@@ ent gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a low @-@ fat single meal or low @-@ fat food .
since the weight reduction in diabetes , with an improved met@@ abolic control , patients should consult a drug or pharmac@@ ist before beginning a therapy with all@@ i to treat a doctor or pharmac@@ ist because the dose of anti@@ diabet@@ ic may be adapted .
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for hyper@@ tension or increased blood cholesterol , should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ists if the dosage of this medication must be adapted .
it is recommended to meet additional fluctu@@ ation measures to prevent the possible contra@@ di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea in the event of severe di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
both in a study to inter@@ actions of medicines as well as in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in was observed a decrease of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma tor@@ ch .
when applying war@@ far@@ in or other oral antibodies in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values could be influenced ( internationally standardis@@ ed ratio , IN@@ R ) ( see section 4.8 ) .
in most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K , as well as the beta carot@@ ene in the norm .
however , patients should be recommended to take a supplem@@ entary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement to ensure a sufficient vit@@ amine absorption ( see Section 4.4 ) .
after the gift of a single dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on was observed with a limited number of volunteers working at the same time Or@@ list@@ at , a minor decrease of the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on plasma concentration .
animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effects of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal nature and depend on the pharmac@@ ological effects of the medication , since the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented .
gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporarily .
the Frequ@@ encies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data ) .
the prevalence of known adverse events , which were determined after the launch of Or@@ list@@ at , is not known as these events were voluntarily reported of a population of un@@ certain size .
2 . it is pl@@ au@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i to convert defects in terms of possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal side effects can lead .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple outlets from up to 400 mg three times daily have been administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight subjects , without any significant clinical findings .
in the majority of the reported cases of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosage , there were either no side effects or similar side effects as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on examinations on humans and animal , from a fast re@@ formation , system@@ ic effects that can be attributed to the li@@ pas@@ ar characteristics of or@@ list@@ at .

from clinical studies , 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at was taken three times daily , the absorption of about 25 % of the food fet@@ ime is blocked .
two double @-@ blind , randomised , placebo @-@ controlled trials with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60 mg Or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ cris@@ es , fet@@ ime induced nutrition .
the primary parameter , the change of body weight compared to the output value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ ization ) , has been evaluated as follows : as a change of the body weight in the course ( Table 1 ) and as part of the study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of its output weight ( Table 2 ) .
although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average changes in total cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( output value 5,@@ 20 m@@ mol / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mol / l ) .

Alo@@ xi is used for chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ) , as well as chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , which are working for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( like Cy@@ clo@@ phosphate , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or Car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in ) .
Alo@@ xi &apos;s effectiveness can be increased by the additional gift of a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug which can be used as anti @-@ emet@@ ry ) .
the application in patients under 18 years is not recommended because the effects in this age group is not enough for information .
this means that the active ingredient prevents chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was examined in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , which are strong or moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting .
in chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , which are strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of those treated with Alo@@ xi were treated in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 223 ) , opposite 57 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron patients ( 126 from 221 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , who were treated for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of those treated with Alo@@ xi were treated in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron patients ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values stood at 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted the company of Helsinki &apos;s Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a approval for the transit of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : to prevention of acute nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting with strongly em@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chemotherapy due to severe cancer disease and prevention of mal@@ ign@@ ant chemotherapy due to cancer disease .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi to prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chemotherapy , can be strengthened by adding one before the Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids .
because Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can leng@@ then the colo@@ rect@@ al passage should be monitored with an@@ am@@ nesty Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection nar@@ rower .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , caution has been careful when using Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron using medicines that extends the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ T@@ - interval extends or extending to such an extension .
except in connection with a further chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics administration , Alo@@ xi is to be used in the days after chemotherapy , nor for the treatment of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting .
in pre@@ clinical studies in@@ hib@@ ited Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron applied against tum@@ ours ( C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , Cy@@ clo@@ phosphate , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ ine , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ yc@@ in C ) .
in a clinical study , no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic interaction between one single @-@ up intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady concentration met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ one , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in a population @-@ based pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic analysis it was shown that the simultaneous gift of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hibit@@ ors ( D@@ mi@@ o@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , do@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Par@@ tr@@ al@@ in , R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ al@@ in and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) has no significant impact on the cle@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences for the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies are not available , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron must not be applied for pregnant women unless it is necessary to treat the doctor &apos;s treated doctor .
in clinical studies , the most common at a dose of 250 micro@@ grams were observed ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , at least possibly with Alo@@ xi in connection , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of over@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the administration location ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing expertise .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar passages of un@@ wanted events were observed in the other dosing groups ; there were no dose of active relationships .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out due to the great distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis probably is probably not effective therapy at a Alo@@ xi@@ - Over@@ do@@ l .
in two randomised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moderate em@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of Cy@@ clo@@ phosphate ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.3 hours ) received equivalent to day 1 without D@@ am@@ eth@@ ason intraven@@ ously .
a randomised double @-@ blind study included 667 patients with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ c@@ is@@ plat@@ in , as well as 250 mg / m2 cy@@ cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ az@@ ine and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , which were compared to day 1 intraven@@ ously by day .
results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with strong em@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables .
in clinical studies for the indication @-@ induced nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters were comparable with the corresponding effects of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
according to the findings of clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron owns the ability to block the i@@ on@@ ary and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation involved and extend the duration of the shareholder .
the objective of the study conducted at 221 healthy volunteers were the evaluation of the EK@@ G effects of i.@@ V. administered in single doses of 0.25 , 0.75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
Res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous gift follows an initial decrease in the plasma concentration of a slow elim@@ ination from the body with an average terminal time of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration time @-@ time @-@ curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally proportional in general in the entire dose range of 0,@@ 3- 90 μ / kg .
following intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg each second day for a total of 3 doses of 11 Ho@@ den@@ car@@ cin@@ oma patient between day 1 and day 5 measured medium ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration in 42 ± 34 % .
from pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ical simul@@ ations , that , at once daily intraven@@ ous gift of 0.25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in 3 consecutive days reached total exposure ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with the equivalent value of 0.75 mg . however , the C@@ max was equivalent to 0.75 mg .
about 40 % will be eliminated about the kidneys , and approximately another 50 % will be converted into two primary met@@ abolic ites , which have less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in vitro studies on Met@@ abol@@ isation , CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 have been involved in the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in a lower dimensions .
elim@@ ination After a intraven@@ ous dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours of ur@@ ine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an un@@ altered drug made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a single @-@ time intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ in@@ jek@@ tion , the total body weight amounted to 173 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al cle@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although patients with severe liver function , the terminal eli@@ fted elim@@ ination and the average system@@ ic exposure of pall@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , a reduction of the dose is therefore not justified .
in previous trials , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions that are considered adequate across the maximum human exposure to clinical use .
10 Out of pre@@ clinical studies revealed that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concentrations of I@@ on@@ ary channels , which are involved in the vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ generation and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose dischar@@ ged in about 30 times of therapeutic exposure to humans ) that were given daily for two years , led to a greater frequency of liver tumor , en@@ doc@@ rine Ne@@ op@@ las@@ men ( thy@@ ro@@ id , p@@ ine@@ es@@ en@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ors with rats , but not with mice .
the under@@ lying mechanisms are not completely known , but due to the used dosing and Alo@@ xi used for one @-@ time application , the relev@@ ance of this results will be low as for human beings .
the holder of this approval for the market policy must notify the European Commission on plans for the market transport of the regulatory authorities in the framework of this decision .

in June 2006 , the Committee on Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative expert report in which the provision of approval for the treatment of hepatitis C intended for the treatment of hepatitis C had been suggested by Alph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
this means Alph@@ on@@ eon a biological medicine called Ro@@ feron @-@ A with the same practice as well as it should be approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference practice &quot; ) .
Alph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long lasting ) hepatitis C ( one by virus inf@@ ant liver disease ) .
in a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic investigation , the liver tissue injury is further increased , and the values of the liver enz@@ ym@@ s Al@@ an@@ in@@ - amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) has increased in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) was applied to the formation of the active ingredients .
the manufacturer of Alph@@ eon presented data to the comparison of Alph@@ eon with Ro@@ feron @-@ A ( active structure , composition and purity of the pharmaceutical , effectiveness , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of Alph@@ eon was compared with the effectiveness of the reference to 455 patients .
the study was measured as many patients after 12 out of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment of the treatment ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .

furthermore , concerns are in@@ eff@@ ected that the data on the stability of the active ingredients and the product are not sufficient .
the number of patients with hepatitis C that talked to the treatment with Alph@@ eon and Ro@@ feron @-@ A was similar in clinical study .
after adjusting the treatment with Alph@@ eon the disease was inflamm@@ able with more patients than in reference to reference . in addition , Alph@@ eon had also increased any side effects .
in addition , the test was included in the study to test the question , to what extent the medication forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , not suff@@ ici@@ ently vali@@ dated .
it can be used for the treatment of Im@@ pet@@ igo ( one with cr@@ ust formation ) and small in@@ treated la@@ in@@ ations ( R@@ iss@@ or or slic@@ ing ) , de@@ di@@ ced and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go is not to be used to treat infections , det@@ ectable or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) , because Alar@@ con does not work against this type of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients with the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age , the treatment area should not exceed 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment in two to three days , the doctor should re@@ examine the patient and consider alternative treatments into consideration .
it works by block of bacterial reefs ( the parts of bacter@@ i@@ enz@@ elle where proteins are produced ) and in@@ hib@@ its the growth of bacteria .
main indicators of efficacy was in all five studies in the proportion of patients whose infection was sealed after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients with placebo said to placebo .
in the treatment of infected skin wounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar response : when the results were taken together with skin wounds , about 90 % of both groups were enrolled on the treatment .
however , in these two studies it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go in the treatment of wast@@ ew@@ ard@@ y suffer@@ ings in the body fabric ) or of infections which were det@@ ectable or probably caused by M@@ RSA , is not effective enough .
the most common adverse impact with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation of the contrac@@ tor .
the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go on the short @-@ time treatment of the following surface treatment : • Im@@ pet@@ igo , • infected small in@@ fir@@ ations , de@@ ar@@ ising or se@@ wn wounds .
May 2007 the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . a approval for the transit of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union .
patients who show no improvements within two to three days are expected to be considered once and an alternative therapy are considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the case of a sen@@ si@@ zing or heavy local Ir@@ rit@@ ation by applying Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ ts the treatment is canc@@ eled , the oint@@ ment is carefully shut down and an adequate alternative to the infection .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be applied for the treatment of infections where M@@ RSA is known or suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies in secondary wounds the efficacy of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was caused by infections which caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) .
an alternative therapy should be considered to be considered for 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected place .
the impact of simultaneous application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical funds on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical medicine is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentration , which have been reached when people in top@@ ical skin or infected wounds have been reached , a clin@@ ically relevant shirts in vivo is not expected ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 According to the same gift of 2 times daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol increased the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ ts on a di@@ ced skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the small system@@ ic exposure after top@@ ical use in patients , dose adjustments are not required , when top@@ ical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during a system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a Re@@ productive @-@ sto@@ icity according to or@@ aler and are in@@ adequate in terms of consequences for the birth and f@@ öt@@ al / post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy when a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clear and the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is the gift of a system@@ ic anti@@ bi@@ osis .
if the decision continued or termin@@ ate the breast@@ feeding or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go / terminated , it is weak@@ ened between the benefit of the nurs@@ ing and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with su@@ perf@@ icial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was applied , the most frequently reported side effects of Ir@@ rit@@ ation on the administration site which was about 1 % of patients .
effici@@ encies ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of p@@ leu@@ rom@@ util@@ in , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ ilus pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mechanism of action of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein syn@@ thes@@ es by interaction in a specific binding office of the bacterial giant of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ omes which diff@@ ers from the inter@@ ventions of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ ag@@ ul@@ ating anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the ri@@ bos@@ om ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L3 is involved and in the region of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding and the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ring centre .
by connec@@ tive to this binding site hem@@ or@@ r@@ util@@ ine block the pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer , block part P @-@ binding inter@@ actions and prevent normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ aler subjects .
in the reason of the local prevalence of resistance , the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some inf@@ ectious diseases should be aimed at least by experts .
there were no differences in in @-@ vitro activity of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether ins@@ ulated isol@@ ates or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in the case of non @-@ appe@@ aling to the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us the presence of tribes with additional vir@@ ul@@ tural factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption in a study with healthy adults was raised 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ ts daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on in@@ tak@@ ingly and on sh@@ aking skin for up to 7 days .
out of 516 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % of ap@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ ts twice daily for 5 days to the top@@ ical treatment of secondary wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
sample intake took place 3 or 4 in adult patients each prior to Medi@@ ation and during the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual system@@ ic recording in humans according to top@@ ical use of 1 % Sal@@ be on 200 cm2 ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng / h ( h / ml ) 660 times lower than the P@@ GP inhibit@@ ing .
Met@@ abol@@ ism in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver mic@@ ros@@ omes was designed primarily by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , under low participation of CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies for oral tox@@ icity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ ro@@ id changes .
in @-@ vitro examination on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test or in human peripheral blood l@@ ympho@@ cy@@ tes as well as in rats @-@ micro@@ controller to in @-@ vivo study chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there were neither in male nor female nu@@ cle@@ ation of limited fertil@@ ity at oral doses of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which means that up to 5 times higher exposure was achieved as the highest estimated exposure to humans ( top@@ ical application on 200 cm2
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity study on rats were ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to the ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) , development aid x@@ icity ( reduced body weight ) and matern@@ al tox@@ icity .
the owner of approval for the registration process must make sure that the Pharmac@@ ov@@ ig@@ il@@ anz@@ system is present , as in the 1.@@ 8.1 module of the authorisation application ( version 6.2 ) , where the product is mark@@ eted and the product is used as long as the product &apos;s market is used .
the holder of approval for the in@@ war@@ fare is obliged to perform detailed studies and additional pharmac@@ ov@@ ig@@ il@@ anz@@ as , as described in version 1 of Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) , as well as all additional updates of R@@ MP , which will be agreed with the CH@@ MP .
as described in CH@@ MP &quot; Guidel@@ ine on Risk Management Systems for the inal products for human use , &quot; the updated R@@ MP should be submitted simultaneously with the next peri@@ odic Safety Update Report .
irrit@@ ation or other signs and symptoms at the treated point , you should finish the application of Al@@ tar@@ go and speak with your doctor .
do not apply any other sal@@ ts , cre@@ ams or les@@ ions on the area that is treated with Al@@ tar@@ go if it has not expressly accepted by your doctor .
it cannot be used in eyes , mouth or lips , in the nose or in the female genital area .
when the oint@@ ment comes out on one of these faces , wash the place with water and ask your doctor about advice , if complaints occur .
after the removal of the oint@@ ment you can cover the affected area with a ster@@ ile association or a Gaz@@ e@@ association , unless your doctor have not to cover the area .
it is offered in an aluminium tube with a plastic bag which contains 5 , 10 or 15 grams of sal@@ ts , or in an aluminium bag which contains 0,5 g of sal@@ ts .
Ambi@@ rix is used for protection against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) with children aged between one and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used in the context of two doses existing vaccine , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used when immun@@ isation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection , and ensured that it can be run from two doses existing vacc@@ ines .
if a cancellation dose against hepatitis A or B may be given , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given .
vacc@@ ines may occur by combining the immune system ( the natural sh@@ ot@@ gun of the body ) , &quot; as it can we@@ ave against a sick@@ ness .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recogni@@ zes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; strange &quot; and produces antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components such as the vacc@@ ination Twin@@ rix adults and the Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered in the context of three existing vacc@@ inations .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as a letter for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicators for the efficacy was the proportion of overweight children who had developed a month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 208 children , the vaccine is compared with six months and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix led a month after the last injection on hepatitis A and B between 98 and 100 % of the im@@ min@@ ated children after the last injection .
the additional study showed that the degree of the Ambi@@ ence of Ambi@@ rix was a six @-@ month gap between the inj@@ ections .
the most common adverse events of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ines ) are head@@ ache , appet@@ ite , pain on injection , tube , matter ( fatigue ) and irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not react to patients who may possibly react to the active substances , one of the other components or Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an anti@@ bi@@ otic ) must not be applied .
August 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ etic s.@@ a. a permit for the In@@ per@@ ation of Ambi@@ rix in the entire
the di@@ mm@@ et plan for the Grun@@ dim@@ mer with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is given to the vote and the second dose ranges between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a review is required for hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ ent vacc@@ ines or combined with a combination .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B virus ( anti @-@ H@@ bs@@ A@@ g ) anti @-@ hepatitis B virus ( anti @-@ H@@ bs@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis B virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti @-@ hepatitis C virus are observed in the same size rules as after vacc@@ ination vacc@@ ination .
it is not yet secured whether immun@@ ity individuals who have been addressed to an Hepatitis A vaccine , because they may also need more det@@ ectable antibodies since they are also protected by immune memory .
3 As for all injection levels , an an@@ aph@@ yl@@ actic reaction should be immediately available for the rare case of an@@ aph@@ yl@@ actic reaction after the gift of the vacc@@ ination corresponding possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring .
if a faster protection against hepatitis B is required , it is recommended that it contains 360 ELISA units formal@@ in in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface .
in hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies is achieved so that in these cases , further vacc@@ ines may be required .
because a intra@@ ocular injection or in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular administration could lead to a sub@@ sid@@ y suffer@@ ers , these inj@@ ectors should be avoided .
in these cases , the ro@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ t@@ open@@ ia or blood circulation disorders may be inj@@ ected , as it can be inj@@ ected in these cases after in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular administration .
if Ambi@@ rix was given in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined Di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ o , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ oph@@ ilus influenza type b vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined mas@@ ern@@ - m@@ um@@ ps vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients suffering from immun@@ oph@@ onic therapy or in patients with immun@@ om@@ ial defects , no adequate immune response is achieved .
in a clinical study , associated with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults was the frequency of pain , ro@@ cking , sw@@ elling , Matcha , head@@ ache and fever , comparable with the frequency that was observed at previous Thi@@ omer@@ ang and preserv@@ ative vaccine formulation .
in clinical studies , 20@@ 29 vaccine doses have been administered at a total of 10@@ 27 Imp@@ air@@ ings at the age of 1 to and including 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 up to and including 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared to the 3 @-@ cans combination .
only exceptions were the higher Frequ@@ encies of pain and Mat@@ s at a calculation base per vacc@@ ination : Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.7 % of the subjects , compared to 3@@ 9.1 % of the subjects after receiving a dose of 3 @-@ cans .
according to the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6,4 % of the subjects had given the Ambi@@ rix , over pain , opposite 6@@ 3.8 % in the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination .
however , the frequency of Mat@@ s was comparable to each test ( i.e. , over the whole vaccine cycle at 3@@ 9.6 % of the subjects , the Ambi@@ rix was compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects who received the 3 @-@ cans combination .
the frequency of im@@ pregn@@ ated pain and pain was low and comparable to the combination of the combination @-@ layer with the 3 @-@ cans oc@@ in@@ ema .
in a comparative study of 1- and 11 @-@ year @-@ old Imp@@ air@@ y , the occurr@@ ence of local actions and general actions in the Ambi@@ ence group comparable with the 3 @-@ doses combined with 360 ELISA units formal@@ ise in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface .
in the 6- to 11@@ - year @-@ old , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a frequency of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , was not reported per pro@@ d@@ band .
the share of Imp@@ air@@ ingen , who reported above heavy side effects during the 2 @-@ cans vacc@@ ination schem@@ as with a 360 EL@@ ISA@@ - units formal@@ in in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface treatment , was statistically not different .
in clinical studies that were conducted at Imp@@ fl@@ ingen , aged 1 to and including 15 years , the serum rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , for month 6 ab@@ brevi@@ ated dose ( d. h. in month 7 ) .
the rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , for month 6 ab@@ brevi@@ ated dose ( d. h. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparable study that was carried out in 12- to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were given the standard combin@@ ants with three cans .
in the 289 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ icity was imp@@ aired , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ates rates ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 were significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immun@@ ity , which were achieved in a clinical study period of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after the completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. , in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the Imp@@ air@@ inge were either a 2 @-@ cans vacc@@ ines with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ cans vacc@@ ination with a combination of 360 ELISA units formal@@ in activated hepatitis B virus and 10@@ µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface .
for individuals who were aged between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination .
the immun@@ ity reaction observed in this study was comparable to vacc@@ ination of 3 cans using a combination @-@ based h@@ epat@@ it@@ is@@ - A @-@ virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose of 0,5 ml .
in a clinical study of 12- to including 15 @-@ year olds could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies are comparable to immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccine scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life with the collection of a combined Di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ o , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ul@@ o@@ rem , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ ia ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or was administered with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les @-@ m@@ um@@ ps vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study involving 3 doses of this present formulation was performed in adults , showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ations and ser@@ o@@ con@@ ical rates such as for earlier versions .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transferred via vir@@ al cont@@ amin@@ ants and drinks , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as by bathing in water @-@ water pollution .
you can feel very tired , have a dark ur@@ ine , a red face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yel@@ lowing ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment .
like all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix cannot protect it completely in front of an infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the full vacc@@ ination series was completed with 2 doses .
if you are infected / your child before the administration of both vacc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix is already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus ( though you / your child does not feel un@@ likely or sick ) may not prevent a disease .
a protection against other infections which cause the liver ab@@ uses or symptoms that are similar to those according to an hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection , can not be convey@@ ed .
• If you have an allergic reaction to the Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an anti@@ bi@@ otic ) .
an allergic reaction can differ through ju@@ ck@@ eting skin envelop@@ es , breathing not or sw@@ elling of face or tongue . • if you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you have / your child a severe infection with fever left / her child .
• If you want to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. , within 6 months and prior to the administration of the second vacc@@ ination ) .
with a potential risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the physician is given to you / your child from a vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , it will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective components per vacc@@ ination ( 360 ELISA units of a formal@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vacc@@ ination of this vaccine with reduced content of effective components is usually administered a month after the first dose and should give you a vaccine protection before termination of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes , Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected with people suffering from severe blood circulation , under the skin and not in the muscle , if you are weak@@ ened / her child under a disease or treatment in your / her body &apos;s body or if you / her child is under@@ going a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these persons on the vaccine can not be sufficient , so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the response to vacc@@ ination is necessary .
21 Do you receive your doctor if you lose / your child ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated with or if you have been vacc@@ inated or if you have been vacc@@ inated or associated with Immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine ( antibodies ) or that in the near future is planned .
but it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate areas and as possible different lim@@ bs .
if Ambi@@ rix is given to the same time or shortly before or after a injection of Imm@@ un@@ lob@@ bies , it is likely that the response to the vaccine is still sufficient .
normally , Ambi@@ rix pregnant or l@@ act@@ ating women is not administered , except it is ur@@ gently needed that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B .
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has already showed an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( anti@@ bi@@ otic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , please talk to your doctor and make a new date as soon as possible .

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and packs available in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data , which have been known since the issu@@ ance of the first authorization for the market conditions , the CH@@ MP grants the view that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for the Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
since Ambi@@ rix was only limited in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this product is limited due to low patient exposition .
Ammon@@ ites can also be used in patients aged over a month with in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ def@@ ective or with hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic En@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y ( brain damage ) in the pre@@ history .
am@@ mon@@ ohydr@@ ate is divided into several single doses of meals , including food mixed or via a Gast@@ rost@@ om@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ also ( through the abdom@@ inal cloth in the stomach &apos;s leading hose ) or a no@@ bl@@ onde ( by the nose to the stomach @-@ leading hose ) .
it was no comparative study , because am@@ ids are not compared with a different treatment or placebo ( a head@@ line medicine that could be compared with active ingredient ) .
am@@ mon@@ ey@@ es@@ eed , it can also return to appet@@ ite , ri@@ pen@@ sions , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , nau@@ sea , li@@ fe@@ asi@@ bility , flav@@ our@@ ing , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin r@@ ash , un@@ riv@@ alled body od@@ or , or weight gain .
the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the end that am@@ ids in patients with dis@@ rup@@ ting the ur@@ inary cycle has been effective for high am@@ mon@@ ium values .
Ammon@@ ites was approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , since due to the rarity of the disease on the time of approval only limited information to this medication .
the use is inde@@ xed in all patients where a complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ man@@ gel has been manifested in new@@ born ( within the first 28 living days ) .
in patients with a late @-@ delay form ( complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ def@@ ective , which manifested itself after the first life of life ) , then an indication for use when in the An@@ am@@ ese of a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic En@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y .
for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets , or for patients with swal@@ lowing . AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form .
the daily dose is individually calculated using the protein toler@@ ant and for the growth and development of the daily protein intake of the patients .
according to previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg and with adult growing and adults .
in patients who suffer from an early @-@ manipul@@ ated deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosphate or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ qui@@ ase , is the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ y@@ lin or arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an Arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ uc@@ ats@@ yn@@ thetic deficiency need arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8,8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS pills may not be given to patients with sl@@ u@@ ck@@ eting dysfunction , as a risk for the origin@@ ation of ec@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets will not reach immediately in the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mol ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
therefore , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS therefore should be used with cont@@ am@@ ous heart failure or severe kidney failure , as well as with So@@ dium re@@ arm and eyel@@ id formation , only be applied with caution .
since met@@ abolic and de@@ position of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat across the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS will only be applied to patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore con@@ ferred ( see 4.3 ) .
the sub@@ cut@@ aneous util@@ isation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate to young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ down of neur@@ ons and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
it also found a delayed matur@@ ation of cr@@ eb@@ r@@ als syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functional nerv@@ es in the brain and thereby a disability of the brain growth .
it could not be noted whether the phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ acet@@ ate is left in breast milk , and this reason is the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during the breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , at least 56 % of patients showed an un@@ wanted event ( AE ) and at 78 % of these un@@ wanted events that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS in connection .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 @-@ year @-@ old ano@@ vic patient in conjunction with Lak@@ eh@@ azi@@ de , severe mort@@ gage , tanks , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ at@@ itis .
a case of over@@ dosage occurred in a 5 month old small child with a se@@ eable single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accum@@ ulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ acet@@ ate that showed an intraven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ is@@ lim@@ iting Ne@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abolic active connection caused by acet@@ ylene with glut@@ amine for phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is left over the kidneys .
sten@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally saw phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both coupl@@ ings contain 2 nitrogen oxide ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for identification of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with dis@@ rup@@ ting the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that for each gram , sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat may be produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gluten @-@ nitrogen .
it is of meaning that the diagnosis is early , and the treatment started immediately to improve survival opportunities and improve the clinical outcome .
the progn@@ osis of the early symptoms of the disease with the occurr@@ ence of the first symptoms in new@@ born was previously almost always inf@@ ist , and the disease carried out in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with its st@@ ick@@ ness free analog within the first year of life for death .
due to hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis , the exploitation of alternative ways of nitrogen oxide ( So@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate ) , protein reduced K@@ ost and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids was possible to increase survival rate in post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first life month ) diagnosed diseases to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients the survival rate was treated with many people with intellectual disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late @-@ delay form of the disease ( including female patients with h@@ etero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ che bam@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic En@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y and a protein reduced diet amounted to 98 % .
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly noticeable in treatment and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition may occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phenol , which is con@@ vol@@ ved in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ ically with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its met@@ abolic processes in plasma and ur@@ ine were obtained after the gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat for so@@ ber healthy adults and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabolism was also investigated in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous gift of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate .
after a oral single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tray form were determined 15 minutes after intake plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cycles or hem@@ oph@@ bin@@ e@@ opath@@ y , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was det@@ ectable in plasma .
three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were treated with sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in plasma concentration were higher than after the first gifts .
differentiation of the medicine is left within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product glut@@ amine of the kidneys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us testing , sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat was treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is given either oral ( infants and children who can &apos;t swal@@ low any tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowed disorders ) or via a gast@@ ro@@ om@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ also or a no@@ bl@@ onde .
according to previous clinical experience the normal daily dose of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ born babies , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with a body weight over 20 kg and with adult growing and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins should be kept within the normal area .
in patients who suffer from an early @-@ manipul@@ ated deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosphate or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ qui@@ ase , is the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ y@@ lin or arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mol ) sodium per gram of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl car@@ nit@@ rate , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rat which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rats were suspended from the birth of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ acet@@ ate ( active met@@ alli@@ zation of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , it came to L@@ ä@@ s in the pyr@@ am@@ mal cells of the brain cell .
a likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 @-@ year @-@ old ano@@ vic patient in conjunction with Lak@@ eh@@ azi@@ de , severe mort@@ gage , tanks , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ at@@ itis .
sten@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally saw phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both coupl@@ ings contain 2 nitrogen oxide ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the identification of excess
on the basis of investigations about the differentiation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with dis@@ rup@@ ting the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that for each gram , sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat may be produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gluten @-@ nitrogen .
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly noticeable in treatment , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition may occur .
after a oral single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in Gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form were determined 15 minutes after intake plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
during the duration of the durability , the patient can retain the ready product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
for this approach , the small measuring spoon contains 0.@@ 95 g , the mean measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rat .
if a patient must receive the medication about a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ u@@ bility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare cases , certain liver enz@@ ym@@ es are missing , so that they can end@@ ure the st@@ ick@@ ness of waste products , which are not exp@@ elled after consumption of proteins in the body .
if you have conducted laboratory studies , you must inform the doctor that you have to use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat may affect the results of certain laboratory studies .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other drugs , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if you have taken any other drugs or recently taken , even if it is not subject to pres@@ cription drug .
while nurs@@ ing time , you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as the drug may go over and harm your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , head@@ ache , flav@@ ours , flav@@ our@@ ing problems , im@@ pet@@ us , memory disorders and a deteri@@ oration of existing neurolog@@ ical states were observed .
if you find one of these symptoms you will immediately contact with your doctor or with the Not@@ ice of your hospital for the introduction of an appropriate treatment .
if you forgot the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS take the corresponding dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood sugar to the heart ) , for example when un@@ stable Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in breast corne@@ al with different thickness ) or my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart failure ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( a abnormal measuring value of the electro@@ cardi@@ ac or EC@@ G ) .
is angi@@ ox to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients applied to one PCI , a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart failure to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of one PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study about the treatment of ACS with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another drug to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) with conventional combination treatment with H@@ ep@@ arin ( another antibody ) and a G@@ PI .
while the PCI was frequently used a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the Ar@@ ter@@ ie to prevent a closure ) , and they received additional drug to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and A@@ spir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without gift of G@@ PI - at preventing a new events ( deaths , cardi@@ ac disease or revol@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year , as well as the conventional treatment .
in patients who were subjected to a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was as effective as H@@ ep@@ arin , except for severe bleeding , with which it was much more effective than H@@ ep@@ arin .
an@@ gi@@ ox may not be applied in patients who may be ins@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , other mil@@ ud@@ ine or one of the other components .
it cannot be applied in patients who had a blood of blood , as well as people with strong hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or a heart attack .
the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox in the treatment of ACS and a PCI is an acceptable replacement for h@@ ep@@ arin .
September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd a approval for the marketing of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / Non@@ - ST @-@ Heb@@ lich ) ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) in case of emergency aid or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initial initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous displacement of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
if the patient is executed one PCI , an additional Bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to clinical requirements , the reduced inf@@ usi@@ ons@@ dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately before the procedure , a net of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered , followed by an infusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a resolution of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an intraven@@ ously subsequent intraven@@ ous infusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h must be at least for the duration of the intervention .
the safety and efficacy of a all@@ po@@ us @-@ gift from An@@ gi@@ ox is not examined and is not recommended , even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
if this value ( ACT is shortened after 5 minutes ) at less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be made .
in order to reduce the occurr@@ ence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and diluted medicines should be carefully shu@@ ff@@ ly administered by the use and the Bol@@ us@@ dose rapidly administered intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg infusion dose is given correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney limitations ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which is treated with one PCI ( whether with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS is treated or not ) , a lower inf@@ usi@@ ble rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is less than 225 seconds , a second Bol@@ us@@ dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ dose once again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage caused by the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) that were included in the approval , the ACT amounted to 5 minutes after the gift of the bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us at average 366 ± 89 seconds .

patients are treated carefully with regard to symptoms and signs of blood pressure , especially when Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is administered in combination with another anti @-@ anti co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even if using existing PCI patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , most bleeding occur in the arter@@ ial points , patients who occur in a per@@ tin@@ ent cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , during the treatment of principle everywhere bleeding .
in patients who are treated with War@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International norm@@ alised ratio ) should be achieved in order to ensure that the value after treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in again achieved this level prior to treatment .
based on the knowledge about the action mechanism of anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ sions ( h@@ ep@@ arin , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ol@@ y@@ tics or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tic aggreg@@ ates ) , these active substances increase the blood of blood .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for treating adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes , which require a treatment with ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) in the abdom@@ inal wall or the upper arm or the upper arm with an ins@@ ulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough ins@@ ulin to control the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or ins@@ ulin .
ins@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in diff@@ ers very slightly from human@@ ins@@ ulin , and the change means that it works faster and more shorter than a short inter@@ mitt@@ ent human ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a slow ins@@ ulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , where the body can &apos;t produce ins@@ ulin , in two trials with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , when the body ins@@ ulin had not been effective , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicators for the efficacy was the modification of the substance gly@@ cer@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how good the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study with type 1 diabetes after six months a reduction of 0.14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a decrease of 0.14 % in ins@@ ulin per capita .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % compared to human@@ em Reg@@ ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be applied in patients who are potentially ins@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against ins@@ ulin or one of the other components , or in patients who suffer from h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia .
the cans of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adapted when it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can work on blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ ent@@ is Deutschland GmbH appro@@ ving a approval of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the field of abdom@@ inal ceiling , or to apply sub@@ cut@@ aneous using continuous infusion in the area of abdom@@ inal cav@@ ity .
due to the reduced glucose levels capacity and the lower ins@@ ulin supply , the ins@@ ulin need to be reduced in patients with a restriction of the liver function .
any change of the active effect , the brand ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the ins@@ ulin ( normal , N@@ PH , pre @-@ delayed , etc . ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or production method can draw a change in the ins@@ ulin requirement .
3 An in@@ sufficient dosage or demol@@ ition of treatment , especially in patients with a ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes , can lead to a hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabet@@ ic ket@@ ac@@ ia ; these states are potentially life @-@ threat@@ ening .
the change@@ over of a patient to another ins@@ ulin @-@ type or a ins@@ ulin of another manufacturer should be carried out under str@@ ingent medical supervision and can make a change of dosage .
the effect of a h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia depends on the active profile of the ins@@ ulin and can therefore change at the conversion of treatment schem@@ as .
to increase the substances that increase the blood sugar be@@ ating activity and the inclination to h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ ph@@ ic DNA ( ACE ) inhibit@@ or , disper@@ sion , di@@ op@@ ric oxi@@ di@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ yl@@ line , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ z , sal@@ icy@@ lic and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , under the effect of Sym@@ path@@ ol@@ y@@ tics , such as in@@ lock@@ ers , Cl@@ on@@ id@@ ine , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ ine and reserve the symptoms of ad@@ mir@@ ro@@ id , or missing or missing .
animal experimental studies for re@@ productive @-@ sto@@ icity showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human@@ ins@@ ulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether ins@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in into human breast milk occurs but in general , ins@@ ulin must not be addressed in breast milk , nor is absorbed by oral application .

heavy h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ Cheese with consciousness can be given by using a in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Gl@@ uk@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by a doctor accordingly by an intraven@@ ous gift of glucose .
after a glucose projection , the patient should monitor the patient in a hospital to determine the ur@@ - cause for the heavy h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia and avoid similar episodes .
ins@@ ulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimul@@ ating peripheral glucose intake ( especially through sk@@ el@@ eton mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that sub@@ cut@@ aneous fermentation process occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than at hu@@ - man@@ em normal normal .
in a study with 18 male persons aged between 21 and 50 years with type 1 diabetes , ins@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ in showed a proportional increase in a therapeutic reduction factor of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.15 E / kg , and a proportional increase in a high @-@ proportional increase in the low cost reduction effect , exactly like human@@ ins@@ ulin .
ins@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as fast activity occurs such as a normal human ins@@ ulin and achieved a complete glu@@ ing effect about 2 hours earlier than human@@ ins@@ ulin .
from the data it was evident that when an application of ins@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ins in 2 minutes before meal a similar post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ally glyc@@ em@@ ic control is achieved as with human@@ em Reg@@ in@@ ulin which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if ins@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ins were ge@@ ared in 2 minutes before meal , a better post @-@ postoperative control was given as with human@@ em Reg@@ ins@@ ulin which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if ins@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal is turned , a comparable glyc@@ em@@ ic control is given as for human Reg@@ ins@@ ulin , which is given 2 ten@@ ds before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
ins@@ ulin delivery in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - previously ) before the beginning of the meal was given ( Figure 1A ) as well as compared to human@@ em Reg@@ in@@ ulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal was given ( Figure 1B ) .
