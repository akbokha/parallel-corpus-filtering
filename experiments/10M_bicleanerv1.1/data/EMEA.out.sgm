<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Opportunities report (EPAR) in which explains how the Committee for Humanities (CHMP) has been evaluated in order to obtain recommendations concerning the application of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you require further information on your disease or treatment, please read the packagile age (also part of the EPAR) or consult your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you wish for more information regarding the recommendations of the CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of melting trays (tablets that dissolve in the mouth) as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and as injected solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. acting thinking and speaking, hallucinations (listening or vision of things which are not available), mistrust and madness; • bipolar-I disorder, a mental condition where the patients lack of patients (periods are abnormal) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used for the treatment of moderate-severe episodes and preventative episodes in patients who have addressed in the past to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is applied for rapid control of disturbance or behavioural dysfunction when the oral intake of medication is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both diseases can take the solution to insert or used melting trays in patients where the swallowing of tablets are prepared.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients receiving other medicines at the same time, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impaired the signal transmission between brain cells by "Neurotransmitter," i.e. chemical substances which enable communication of nerve cells.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol works especially as "partial agonist" for the receptors for the receptors for the neurotransmitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called Serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole looks like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in lower dimensions as the neurotransmitter acts to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Da Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin is a role in schizophrenia and bipolar immunity to normalize the activity of the brain, causing the brain or lack of brain, causing psychological or lack of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify, repeating the symptoms of symptoms, was examined in three trials over one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">Injection of injection solution was compared to placebo in two trials in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar illnesses that were compared to a placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was observed about twelve weeks in 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo which were stabilized in 160 patients, in which the manian symptoms were already stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was suffered in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disturbance, which were compared with Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change of symptoms of patients based on a standard scale for bipolar immunity or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also led studies in order to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tray and the solution to be resorating (absorbs).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution, the Abilify showed in doses of 5,25 mg, 9,75 mg, or 15 mg, a significantly higher reduction in symptoms than the patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In use for the treatment of bipolar immunity, Abilify decreased in four of the five short-time studies of manic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify prevented for up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo during previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10 - or 15-mg-cans were also more effective than placebo the symptoms of disturbance and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common adverse events of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients), acathering (constant movement), reversal, nausea (distiffness), creamy, nausea (advanced storage production), salial, nausea (elevated memory production), tiredness and exhaustion, oinability, insomnie (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Humanities (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and of medium-heavy episodes in patients who had mostly manic episodes and during which the lack of episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the Committee came to the result that the advantages of injection solution in the fast control of increased disturbance and behavioural disorders in patients with manicophrenia or in patients with manic episodes with bipolar-I disorder when an oral therapy is not suitable, opposite the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a approval for the investment of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate episodes of bipolar-I- disorder and prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mostly manic episodes and their manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased efficacy in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected, although single patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar-I- disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not detected.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the larger sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered as clinical factors (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 induction is removed from combination therapy, the Aripivotal dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicides are one of mental illness and affecologically disturbances and was reported in some cases after onset of antipsychotic therapy, even in treatment with Aripivotzole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar immunity, no increased suicides are caused by Aripivotzole compared to other antipsychotica.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazol should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, infectious disease), cerebrovascular disease, conditions that applied for hypotony (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure sensitive drugs) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spicdyskinesia: in clinical trials which one year or less continued, there were occasional reports about during the treatment with Aripivotzole Dyskinesis.</seg>
<seg id="39">If patients treated with ABILIFY treated patients and symptoms of a spicdyskinesis, the dose should be reduced to reduce the dose or to break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient developed signs and symptoms developed on a mns, or unclear a fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotica must be removed, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="41">In case, Aripiprazole should be applied to patients with crampires in the Anamnese or in condition that are used with clampires in connection with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years old with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole, an increased risk of death in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">There was however in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to unwanted quebrovascular events at Aripivotal's patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with keto socket or hyperosmolarem Koma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic agents including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There is no precise risk assessment for hyperglycemia-related events at ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic agents treated with direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored in terms of deterioration of glucose levels regularly.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally observed in schizophrens patients and in patients with bipolar manie, the application of antipsychotica, with which weight gain is known as tribution, and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Because of the primary effects of Aripiprazole, the central nervous system has been careful if Aripiprazole is used in combination with alcohol or other centralized medication such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a magic acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study of healthy subjects, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazole by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected to expect that other high-effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects have and therefore similar doses should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">In the CYP2D6 'bad' (= "Poor") Metabolizing, the joint application can result in higher plasma concentration of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentration in comparison to CYP2D6 highly-intensive Metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common gift of Ketoconazol or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefits should have the potential risks for the patients.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV proteasors, which have similar effects, and therefore similar doses should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After setting the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the Dosishheight before the beginning of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 can be administered together with ABILIFY, can be calculated with a direct increase in the Aripivotzol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">Clinical studies show doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazole per day no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3 Methodixymorphan ratio), 2C19 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Wareprazol) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">The patients should come to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnant during treatment with Aripivotzol.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data base to security during human being and due to the reproductive studies in pregnancy, this medication must not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefits are clear, the potential risk for the fötus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, in other antipsychotica, patients should have warned, dangerous machines, including power vehicles, including power vehicles, until they are sure that Aripiprazole has no negative influence.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medical-related adverse events (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency below the side effects listed below is defined in the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study about 52 weeks occurred in patients who were treated with Aripiprazole (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinson's, Dystonie and Dyskinesis, compared to patients who were treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% was diagnosed under Aripivotzole treatment and 13.1% in patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.8% was treated with Aripiprazole, and 15.1% in patients under Olano therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes with bipolar-I disturbance - In a controlled study about 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23,5% was under Aripivotzol- Treatment and 53,3% in patients with infameridol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study, over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% was under Aripivotal treatment and 17,6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-time period, over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% was observed in the treatment of Aripivotzol- treatment and 15.7% for placebo patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripivotzole and placebo where potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters found no medically meaningful differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Enhancements of CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporary and broptomatic were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripivotal patients, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Regarding the side-side effects, which may occur in connection with anti-psychological therapy, the malignant neuroleptosis syndrome, splicdyskinesis and varicfanfalls, unwanted quebrovascular events and increased mortality with older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">Clinical studies and since the market launch were unintentional or deliberate overdose of Aripivotzol in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death sequence.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there are no information on the effectiveness of a Hemodialysis treatment with Aripivotzole. however, it is probably unlikely that Hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdosage of value is because Aripiprazole has a high plasma connection.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the effectiveness of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder on the combination of a partial agonist effect on Dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and a antagonist effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazol showed a high affinity to the Dopamine D2- and D3-receptor as well as a moderate affinity to Dopamine D4-, for serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7, to alpha-1-adrenergen and to the Histamin-H1receptors.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the gift of Aripivotzol in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks to healthy volunteers showed a dosisdependent reduction in the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3-receptor-ligently, on Nucleus caudatus and the turkey.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) at 1.228 schizophrens patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Aripivotzole compared to placebo a statistically significant improvement of psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a Haloperidol-controlled study, 52% of the proportion of response patients who were involved in the study drug was similar to both groups (Aripivotzole 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values of measuring scals which were defined as secondary studies, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- depression scale, showed significantly stronger improvement than for Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study, over 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia showed a significantly higher reduction in the decline rate which was 34% in the Aripivotzole group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olano-controlled study, multinational double-blind study at schizophrenia, which included 314 patients (N = 18 or 13% of the percentage points) in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) at an average weight of about 5.6 kg.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with a flexible or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder showed Aripiprazole to placebo over placebo over 3 weeks compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disturbance showed no overlegenic effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo- and active monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed recognition, Aripiprazole showed an increase effect compared to placebo which was comparable with lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, Aripiprazol also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of manie like lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study over 6 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of an bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic pressurised, the escort therapy with Aripiprazol found an overlegenic effectiveness in reducing its symptoms compared to monotherapies with lithium or Valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study, over 26 weeks, followed by a long-time enlargement phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had reached Aripiprazole during a stabiliser in front of Randomtiol, to placebo superior to placebo in terms of prevention of a bipolar backplane, mainly in the prevention of a relase in the manie.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 is responsible for the elongation and hydroxycyclist, the N-Dealkylation is addressed by CYP3A4 Catalysis.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean eliminationshallow time is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole, with extensive metabolic processes using CYP2D6 and for nearly 146 hours at 'bad' (= "Poor") Metabolizing.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripivotzole, there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as well as demonstrated in a pharmacokinic investigation, patients no gender-dependent effect.</seg>
<seg id="91">A population-specific analysis of pharmacokinetics revealed no indication to clinically significant differences regarding ethnicity or the impact of the noise on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="92">Pharmacokinic features of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripivotzol was similar to patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study of subjects with different grave liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect regarding the impairment of the liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazol and Dehloro-Aripizole, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw rooting to their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on security spicology, toxicity at repeated treatment, reproductive-elasticity, genotoxicity and for the canogens potential the preclinical data may recognize any special hazards for people.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only for dosing or expositions, which exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so that they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects generated a dosiscence-dependent epidemics (AUC) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to 3 to 10mg / kg / day) in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (the 10fold of the middle steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose when people).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a Cholelithiasis was determined as a result of the expulsion of sulphate conjugate from Aripivotzol to the Gall of Monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1 to 3fold the recommended dose dose when humans is based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, in human genes were found at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of sulfate-conjugate of hydroxy- Aripivotzole no more than 6% of concentrations that were detected in the study over 39 weeks in the gall of monkeys, and lie far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosing, which led to expositions of 3- and 11x of medium sized Steady-State AUC in the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is a anti-microtubuli active ingredient that foster the interlocking of the microtubuli and stabilizes the microtubuli by inhibiting their Depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to a Hemp of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vitale interphase and the erotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that Albumina conveys the Transcytosis of plasma components in the endothelial cells and in the context of in-vitro studies proved that the presence of Albumin the transport of Paclitaxel through endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is believed that this improved transendothelial transport through the gp-60-albuminati is conveyed and due to the albuminous protein SPARC (reted protein acidic rich in cysteine) a Paclitaxel accumulation in the area of the tumour occurs.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two-part-blind studies and of 454 patients who were treated in a randomized Phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study, 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>

<seg id="363">Injection can also be carried out by the patient or his supervisor supervisor, provided that they have adequate guide.</seg>
<seg id="364">Patients with chronic renal failure or patients who received a chemotherapy should always be given in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per Deciliter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients are to control in front of the treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency should be administered during the whole treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients who receive any chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anemia may be caused by a erythropoietinmangel, or that the body is not sufficient to the body's own Erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also applied to operations in order to increase the number of red blood cells, thus reducing the consequences of a blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell which has been introduced into a gene (DNA) which is capable of converting the epoch of Epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared with administration in a vein in the context of a main study with 479 patients, which suffered from kidney problems with reference to reference problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">At least eight weeks, Eprex / Erypo was injected at least eight weeks before it had been injected either at intervals or even Eprex / Erypo.</seg>

<seg id="386">Anamiesymptome and follications can be different depending on age, gender and total disease load vary, hence, the assessment of individual clinical trials and health insurance is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in hemophbins by more than 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability of patients can occasionally be observed in patients with individual hemophbinbins over or below the hemophbinbin- target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of these hemophbinaries, the hemoglobin target concentration should reach 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>

<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as response during the end of the six months study (based on the therapy) were included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 patients with Aclasta and 107 patients treated with risk-up study, the therapeutic concerns at 141 of the patients treated with Aclasta compared to 71 patients with risk-treated patients are treated with an average duration of the follow-up period of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-off and multiples 5 and 15 minutes of infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of Zoledronic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data which proved to be a dosisan independent.</seg>

<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the acceptance of Zoledronic concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface below the curve (plasma concentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A dimined Clearance by Cytochrome P450-Enzymic systems is unlikely to metabolizes because Zoledronic acid is not metabolized, because they are a weak or no direct and / or irreversible inhibitor inhibitor of P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal Clearance of Zoledronic acid correlated with Kreatinin-Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the Kreatinin-Clearance, and in the 64 investigated patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in fact that a light (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate renal impact absorption up to 35 ml / min requires no dose adjustment of the zoledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">Due to severe kidney function (creatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min), only restricted data are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-letal intravenous intravenous dose amounted to 10 mg / kg of body weight and with rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In studies of dogs, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on AUC the 6fold of the recommended human therapeutic exposure) is administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without a renal influencing.</seg>
<seg id="658">Subchronic and chronic toxicity in studies with intravenous application was administered by doses of 0.6 mg / kg as a 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, administered in intervals of 2-3 weeks (a cumulative dosage which corresponds to the 7fold of human therapeutic exposure to the AUC, corresponds to the AUC, corresponds to the AUC.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public. this document is a summary of the European Opportunities report (EPAR), in which the Committee of Humanities (CHMP) has been evaluated in order to obtain recommendations concerning the application of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used for treatment of type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes) in patients (particularly overweight patients), where Metformin (a diabetic medicine) is not shown. • It can be applied together with another diabetic medicine (Dualtherapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients), the metformin alone can not be adjusted alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfondue material or insulin, the previous dose of sulphylharnates or insulin can be retained in combination with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar level); this should be reduced to the dose of sulphylhardening or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be utilized even better and the blood sugar level is reduced, which can be adjusted to type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of acettos was investigated in tripletherapy; the patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphylating material, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In studies the concentration of a substance was measured in the blood (glycerated hemoglobin, HbA1c), which indicates how good the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a decrease in the HbA1c value, which allows the blood sugar values to be reduced by 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional gift of acetate for existing treatment with Metformin and a sulphylharlot in a decrease of HbA1c values by 0.94%, while the additional gift of placebo resulted in a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin was examined in 289 patients, patients receiving acetone in addition to insulin, a reduction in HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared with 0.14% in the patients who had to placebo in addition.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events in connection with Actos were visionaries, infections of the upper respiratory system (cold), weight gain and hypoesthesia (reduced sensitivity to maturity).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may neither be applied in patients either to Pioglitazone or one of the other ingredients react, even in patients with liver problems, cardiac insufficiency or diabetic cookies (high tilt levels - acidity - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Accounts should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with Metformin in patients where Metformin is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="762">October 2000 the European Commission granted the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited for placing an account in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to white, round, curved and wear on one side the marking "15" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS".</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate, and in which Metformin is not suitable for contraindications or incompatibility (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For application of Pioglitazon in patients under 18 years of age are not available, therefore the application is not recommended in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients suffering from the presence at least one risk factor (e.g. previous heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), a decompressful heart failure should begin to increase the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose continuously.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a cardiac insufficiency, weight gain, or edeme, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should follow signs and symptoms of a cardiac insufficiency, weight gain and eyelids are observed when Pioglitazon is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcomes study with Pioglitazone in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes mellitus and advanced advanced macular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study showed an increase in reports about heart failure, which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver values (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard range) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard area, the liver enzymes are as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient is developed that point to a hepatic dysfunction, such as non-explanatory nausea, vomiting, thinnitlessness, fatigue, appetite and / or darker Harn, are the liver enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of patients with Pioglitazone should be continued until the occurrence of the laboratory parameters will be derived from clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with Pioglitazone, a dosisdependent weight gain has been demonstrated, which can stir by fat deposits and is connected in some cases with a fluid resistance.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hemostlation in the therapy with Pioglitazone, a reduced reduction in the mean hemophilia (relative reduction of 4%) and hematokrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative studies with Pioglitazone in patients with metformin (relative reduction in hemoglobbins by 3-4%) and the hematokrits by 3-4% and insulin (relative reduction in hemoglobbins by 1-2% and hematokrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of the increased insulin-sensitivity, the Pioglitacon as a oral two or triple combination therapy with insulin-combination therapy with insulin, the risk of a dossidependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the introduction of Thiazolidindian treatment, Pioglitacon, including Pioglitacon, was reported on a decline or deterioration of a diabetic macular unit with a reduction of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the taking of Pioglitazone and the occurrence of Makulaödemen, but patient should be aware of the possibility of a macular edema; an appropriate ophthalmological purpose should be considered in consideration.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of messages unwanted events as a randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="782">The standardized fracture-incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years treated with Pioglitazone treated women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years with women who were treated with a comparative medical medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the proactive study, a study about 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures in 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years), compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) were treated with patients who were treated with a comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="784">The patients should be aware of a pregnancy, and if a patient wishes to take a pregnancy or the treatment (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the investigation of the interactions have shown that Pioglitazone has no relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Digoxin, Warfarin, phenol procoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that metabolizes of these enzymes are metabolized, Cyclosporin, Calciumkanalblocker and HMGCoCoA-reducer are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with the fibrosis (a cytochrome P450 2C8- Inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 induction door) resulted in a reduction of the AUC of Pioglitazone by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due primarily due to treatment with Pioglitazon which reduces hyperinsulin and increased insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance and thus reducing the availability of metabolic substrate growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (from this data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change of the tower and the refractive index of lens, as they are observed in other hypoglycemia substances.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with Pioglitazone, ALT-Anstiege appeared over the three times the upper limit of the standardisation area as often as placebo, but more rarely than in comparison groups under metformin or sulphylharness.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with advanced advanced macrovascular disease the frequency of a severe cardiac insufficiency was 1.6% higher than under placebo if Pioglitazone bzw.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch, rarely over heart failure in Pioglitazon has been reported, however, when Pioglitazone reported in combination with insulin or patients with cardiac insufficiency in the Anamese.</seg>
<seg id="795">It was a summary analysis of messages unwanted events as a randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazone treated groups and over 7,400 patients treated with a comparative study group.</seg>
<seg id="796">Over a period of 3.5 years of current proactive study, fractures in 44 / 870 (5.1%) were treated with Pioglitazone patients, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days had no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to work with activation specific kernel receptor (Peroxisome Proliferation of the Receptor-γ (PPAR-γ)), which leads to an increased insulin-sensitivity of liver, grease and skeletal muscular cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazone reduces glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose use in case of insulin resistant.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazone versus Gliclazid as monotherapy was carried out more than two years to investigate the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">After two years after the onset of therapy a blood glucose control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) was maintained by Pioglitazone at 69% of the patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study about 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was discontinued in spite of three impregnation phase with insulin, to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared to the patients who continue to use insulin; a reduction of insulin-dosage in the group treated with Pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">Clinical trials over one year showed a statistically significant decline in the Albumin / Kreatinin-Quotient in comparison to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazone (monotherapies with 45 mg versus Plazebo) was tested in a small, 18-week analysis of type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical studies, compared to placebo a reduction of the total plasma triglycerides and the free fatty acids and a rise of HDL- Cholesterinspiegel and marginally, however, clinically increased LDL- Cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical studies over a period of up to two years, Pioglitacon compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclazid the total plasmatriglycades and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was detected, while under metformin and Gliclazid reduced values.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study over 20 weeks, Pioglitazone does not only reduced the triglyceride level, but also improved triglyceride level, this is both a effect on the triglycerid absorption as well as to the hepatic triglycerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the proactive study, a cardiovascular disease study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and existing advanced macular macular disease were randomized in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy either with Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">After orally application, Pioglitacazon is resorated quickly, whereby the peak concentrations in plasma has been achieved in plasma for 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">Based on this basis, the contribution of M-IV corresponds to efficacy in about three times the efficacy of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, Pioglitazone has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamic of Digoxin, Warfarin, phenol procoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with the fibrosis (a cytochrome P450 2C8 Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 Inhibitors) increases the plasma concentration of Pioglitazone (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">According to the orderly use of radioactive ingredient Pioglitazon, the marker was found mainly in the case (55%) and to a lower extent in Harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The medium plasma-elimination period of unchangeable Pioglitazon amounts to 5-6 hours while the entire active metabolic ites is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentration of Pioglitazone and its metabolic diseases are lower than in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers. however, the rates of the oral cleance of the womb are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies occurred in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys, after repeated the plasma volume magnification with hemostlution, anemia and reversibly eccentric cardiac trophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due primarily due to treatment with Pioglitazon which reduces hyperinsulin and increased insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance and thus reducing the availability of metabolic substrate growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) were induced by hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (with male rats) of the ureblazan epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="821">In a animal-model of family omatous polyposis (FAP), treatment with two other thiazolidindian resulted in an elevated frequency of colonies.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and wear on one side the marking "30" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS".</seg>
<seg id="823">The standardized fracture-incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years treated with Pioglitazone treated women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years with women who were treated with a comparative medical medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the proactive study, a study about 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures in 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years), compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) were treated with patients who were treated with a comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study about two years the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with Pioglitazone or Gliclazid were examined.</seg>
<seg id="826">Clinical trials over 1 year showed a statistically significant decline in the Albumin / Kreatinin-Quotient in comparison to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study over 20 weeks, Pioglitazone does not only reduced the sober triglyceride level, but improved the postpranath increased triglyceride level, this is both a effect on the Tryglycererid absorption as well as to the hepatic Tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was missing the goal of their primary endometrically, non-deadly myocardiarction, stroke, acute coronarisation and Revascularisation of the leg arteries, the results suggest that with the intake of Pioglitazone does not include cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and wear on one side the marking "45" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS".</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summary analysis of messages unwanted events with randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazone and more than 7,400 patients treated with a comparative medication, showed increased incidence of bones in women.</seg>
<seg id="831">In the proactive study, a study about 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures in 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years), compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) were treated with patients who were treated with a comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="832">In a study over 20 weeks, Pioglitazone does not only reduced the sober triglyceride level, but improved the postpranath increased triglyceride level, this is both an effect on the triglycerid absorption and also to the hepatic triglycerid synthesis.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actraphane was able to produce a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancreas can not produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes in which the body is not able to use the insulin.</seg>
<seg id="865">After 12 weeks the concentration of a substance (glycerated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured that shows how good the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane led to a decrease in the HbA1c mirrels that it noted that blood sugar levels were similar to the other humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be applied in patients who do possibly react sensitively (allergic) to human insulin (rDNA) or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">In addition, the cans of Actraphane may also be adapted when combined with a number of other medicines (the full list is to be found on blood sugar).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee for Humanities (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Actraphane affects the risks of diabetes in the treatment of diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="870">October 2002, the European Commission granted the company Novo Nordisk A / S approval for the approval of Actraphane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pre-mixed ulin products usually used once or twice a day if a fast initial effect is wished with a longer lasting effects.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection needle must be loaded at least 6 seconds under the skin to ensure that the entire dose has injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood sugar is significantly improved by an intensive insulin therapy, the Hypoglycemia-warning symptoms can perceive and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change regarding strength, brand (manufacturer), insulin-type (rapidly effective, biphase), type of insulin (animal insulin, humaninsulin or insulin) and / or production method (by recombinant DNA compared to insulin of animal origin) can result that a change of dosage is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="875">In case of changing to Actraphane, a dose adjustment is necessary, it may be necessary during the first dose or during the first weeks or months after the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients, with which hypoglykic reactions came after a change of animal insulin on human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypoglycemia were less pronounced or otherwise than with their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Prior to travel, which should go over several time zones, the patient should bring to the advice of his physician, because such journeys can lead to other times, insulin and meals must be taken or taken to other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor must therefore take account for possible interactions in therapy and their patients to inquire after other of them.</seg>
<seg id="879">4. both hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycemia which can occur in a non-controlled diabetic therapy, increase the risk of abnormalities and fruit emergencies in utero.</seg>
<seg id="880">Heavy hypoglykaemia can lead to consciousness and / or crampoules, and with temporary or lasting disturbances of brain function and even death.</seg>
<seg id="881">Disorders of the nervous system casuously - peripheral Neuropathy A rapid improvement of blood glucose control can be associated with complaints, which are known as acute painful neuropathy and normally reversibly.</seg>
<seg id="882">5 A intensification of insulin therapy with an abrupt improvement of blood sugar adjustment could be associated with a temporary deterioration of diabetic retinopathy.</seg>
<seg id="883">Disorders of the skin and the underlying casks - Lipodystrophy In the injection station can be a lipodystrophy, when it was missed to change the infirmity within the injection area.</seg>
<seg id="884">General conditions and complaints at the administration site. during insulin therapy local supersensitivity may occur (Romans, swelling, itching, itching, pain and hematoma at the injection station).</seg>
<seg id="885">Disorders of the immune system Occasia - Urtikaria, Exanthem Very rarely - anaphylactic reactions, generic, sweating, gastrointestinal disturbances, angipururism, breathing difficulties, cardiac abnormalities, low blood pressure and powerlessness.</seg>
<seg id="886">However, a hypoglycemia can be gradually developing: • Easy Hypoglykaemia can be treated through the orale supply of glucose or sugar food.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should therefore always be treated for trauma, sweets, biscuits or sugar fruit juice. • Heavy hypoglykaemia with consciousness are treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) through a sealed aid or by glucose, the intravenously by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect begins within half an hour, the active maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration is up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The Resorption profile lies in it that there is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed Resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A range of diaphragm (hydrolyse-) places in the human insulin molecule were drawn into consideration; none of the metabolic syndrome is active.</seg>
<seg id="891">Based on conventional studies to security spicology, toxicity at repeated gift, genotoxicity, to carcinogens potential and for reproduction, the preclinical data can recognize any special hazards for people.</seg>
<seg id="892">It is recommended - after the Actraphane water bottle was taken from the refrigerator - the temperature of the insulin at room temperature (not above 25 ° C), before the operating instructions for the first use is applied.</seg>
<seg id="893">Some patients, with which hypoglykic reactions came after a change of animal insulin on human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypoglycemia were less pronounced or otherwise than with their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="894">The doctor must therefore take account for possible interactions in therapy and their patients to inquire after other of them.</seg>
<seg id="895">12 Soviets of hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycemia which can occur in a non-controlled diabetic therapy, increase the risk of abnormalities and fruit emergencies in utero.</seg>

<seg id="1411">Due to clinical-relevant differences of systemic exposure of Tacrolimus, this can lead to graft imperation or an increased incidence of adverse events, including lower or overimmune diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always keep the same tackling climate formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; orders of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under the engage control of one in transplantation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">In a consequence of a switch to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and corresponding dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus remains.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should be based on clinical assessment of waste pouring and tolerance in detail and on blood levels (see below "Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After migration from Prograf to Advagraf the tactile valley should be controlled in front of the conversion and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>

<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls of tackling climate change levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Adagraf in order to ensure reasonable substance exposure in the immediate postgraduate phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since Tacrolimus is a substance with low Clearance, an adjustment of the Advagraf-Dosisplatas can take several days until the steady state is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1422">Further dose adjustments can be later necessary, as pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus can change in the course of stabilization of patients after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dose recommendations - liver transplantation prophylaxis of the graft surgery should begin with 0,10 - 0,20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift on the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage - conversion from Prograf to Advagraf must be converted twice daily dosage of Prograf capsules on a once daily dose of unagraf, thus has to take place at a daily dose of 1: 1 (mg: mg), to the entire daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplantation After switching from other immune soup to Adagraf once daily must begin the treatment with the recommended initial initiation recommended for the prophylaxis of the graft.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplant In adult patients who are converted to the agraf is a oral initial dosage of 0.15 mg / kg / day once daily in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant receivers have no clinical experience with unagraf at lung cancer, pancreas and dared patients, in an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day, performed in a oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and in a oral initial initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>

<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function There is no influence on the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potentials of Tacrolimus, however, a careful monitoring of kidney function (including a regular determination of the serum concentration, a calculation of the creatinium and a monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Conversion of Ciclosporin on Advagraf At the conversion of a Cicloss- based on a Tacrolimus-based therapy is caution (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations on the mirror mirror in the whole blood The dosage should be based on clinical evaluation of waste pouring and compatibility in detail under the incidence of whole blood-tacrolimus-Talrolimus controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent checks of tackling climate change levels during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-Talking of Tacrolimus should also change after conversion from Prograf to Adagraf, Dosisadjustments, changes to immunosensity therapy or with simultaneous application of substances that could change the tackling climate concentrations (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Adagraf is a drug with a low amount of Clearance, adjustments of the dose may need several days until the steady state came into force.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies conclude that a successful treatment is possible in most cases if the valley level do not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice the valley mirror of Tacrolimus lie in full blood in the first time after liver transplantations usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">Usually blood concentrations in the range from 5 - 15 ng / ml were used during the subsequent retention of liver, kidney and cardiac transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including graft imperation or other side effects, which can occur in a consequence of Tacrolimus Under- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always keep the same tackling climate formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; orders of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the engage control of one in transplantation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="1442">For the prophylaxis of the graft cancelling of adult heart transplant and graft receiving cancers there are no clinical data for the retardized formulation of the Advantaneous formulation.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Because of possible interactions which can lead to a downgrading of tackling levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal medicine (hypericum perforation) is contained, or other plant protection during a treatment with unagraf (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of tackling climate concentrations in the blood has been offered since the tackling climate of blood can be subjected to such circumstances.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal medications known as Hemmer or inductors of CYP3A4 may affect the metabolism of Tacrolimus and therefore reduce the blood values of Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the tackling climate mirror with the same gift of substances that can change the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the Tacrolimus dose to maintain excessive concentrations (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="1455">Effects of Tacrolimus on metabolism of other drugs tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore the simultaneous application of Tacrolimus is metabolized with the CYP3A4 metabolic metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since Tacrolimus reset the clearing of steroid contrasts and thus increasing the hormones, can be careful with decisions related to health precaution.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that Tacrolimus potentially decrease the Clearance of Pentobarbital and phenazone and their half-time lengthen.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advance is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with hemophilia A (one by the lack of factor VIII, congenital blood clots).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application is based on whether the treatment for the treatment of bleeding or prevention of bleeding in surgical procedure is used.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, causing bleeding problems such as bleeding in the joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but is produced according to a method that is called "recombinant DNA technology."</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell which has been introduced into a gene (DNA) that it is capable of the formation of the human tinnacle VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">It is similar to another in the European Union named Recombinate, however, is similar differently, so that the medicine does not contain proteins or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe up to moderate hemophilia A, including a study with 53 children under six years, the application of the medication was investigated for prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study the efficacy of Advance was honoured with the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood cells with "excellent" or "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common adverse events of Advance (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are Schwinn, headaches, pyrexy (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advance may not be applied in patients who may be insensitive (allergic) against the human tinnacle factor VIII, Maus- or Hamsterprotein or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted the company Baxter AG a approval for the regulatory filing of Advance in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy is based on the severity of factor VIII mangels, according to the place and the extent of blood and the clinical state of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1542">By the following hämoral rhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the specified plasma level (in% of the norm or in i.e. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer repeat until the pain and the acute impairment are removed.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) to repeat until the risk of the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During treatment of treatment, the amount of injections and frequency of injections administered a reasonable determination of factor VIII plasma torates.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can distinguish themselves in their reaction to factor VIII, different in vivo recovery and have different semesters.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 by factor VIII per kg body weight in a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activities are not achieved or when bleeding is not ruled by a reasonable dose, a test must be carried out if necessary for an inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective that other therapeutic measures must be executed.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The administration speed should be set up after the patient, with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">Education of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII oriented IgG Immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma by modified Bethesda assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors, correlated with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days are on the largest and of genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exchanging days and anamiar-known inhibitor development, after migration from a recombinant factor VIII product, a different recombinant factor VIII product was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare rejection of haemophilia A in women, there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and nursing time.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs's largest number of patients showed an inhibitors against factor VIII (5 patients) which have all previously untreated patients who have a higher risk to education for inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000), very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data).</seg>

<seg id="1559">Blood clots was calculated during the whole time and the factor VIII- mirror in plasma and the cleance rate showed sufficient values on 15 postoperatively day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical studies with ADVATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnostic severe hemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and prior exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 150 days) showed only a patient after 26 exposure times with ADVATE (2.4 B.E. in modified Bethesda approach).</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, none of the 53 pediatric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe hemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) was determined by prior exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days) a FVIII inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1562">In previously untreated patients treated with an existing clinical study, 5 of 25 (20%) patients treated with ADVATE treated patients inhibitors against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The immune response of patients on traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by the investigation of antibodies against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">A patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend and an continued peak of anti-Cho cell disease, otherwise no signs or symptoms occur in an allergic reaction or a sensitivity.</seg>

<seg id="1643">In the virus in Advexin, it is a "Adenovirus," which was so modified that there was no copies of himself and therefore cannot trigger the infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Unexin could be injected directly into the tumors and allow the cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein made out of the non-defective in the human body when using existing p53 gene, usually contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When Li-Fraumeni cancer, the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells grow up further and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company put data from a study with a patient in front of the Li-Fraumeni Cancer in the area of subtle, in the bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP answers to the Company's answers, there were still some issues unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the test of initially submitted documents the CHMP on Day 120 generated a list of questions that will be sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">In view of the CHMP, the injection of Advexin Li-Fraumeni-Tumours was not sufficiently proved to take advantage of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee also had concerns concerns relating to the processing of medicines using the body, the type of administration as well as the safety of medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that it can be made in reliable way, and that there is neither the environment nor for people who come in contact with the patient is damaging.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company was not aware of the CHMP, whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who currently participate in clinical trials or "Compassionate Use" programs with Adexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"changed efficiencies" means that the tablets are so composed that one of the most effective components are immediately released and the other is released slowly over a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerobaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic Rhinitis (locusts) using a allergy against pollen inflammation of the nostrils) in patients with nasal mucuous membranes (mutiny nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and teenagers over 12 years the recommended dose of aerobaze twice daily is to be taken every day with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The treatment duration should be as short as possible, as soon as the symptoms, above all the swelling of the nose mucosa (mutoped nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medication can be found on the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The most effective measures were the changes in the severity of the loco, which were reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study the patients carried out their symptoms last 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scala, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all the localization of the nose, patients, the Aerintra's income reported, over a decrease of symptoms by 46,0% compared with 35.9% in the patients, the Pseudoephedrin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa were seen, patients under aerobatics showed a reduction of symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients receiving desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common adverse events of Aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachyric acid, divortex, psychological, headache, headache, fatigue, insomnia (insomnia), Somnolenz (drowsiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerintra can not be applied to patients who may possibly insensitive (allergic) against Desloratadin, Pseudoephedrin, or one of the other parts, against admissible active ingredients or Loratadin (another medicine for the treatment of allergies) are not applied.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerintra can also not be applied in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma (hypertension), cardiac or vasculmination (hypertension), cardiac or vasculum (overfunction of thyroid) or already have an inflamorrhagic stroke (caused by a brain bleeding) or have a risk for an inflamorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted SP Europe to approval an approval of aerobatics in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but it is whole to swallow (i.e., without crushing, break or cut off).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerintra should not be applied using the lack of data to injustice and effectiveness (see Section 5.1) of children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after taking the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time on 10 days, since the long-term application the activity of Pseudoephedrin can take this time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After decline of swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper breathing because the treatment is continuing with desloratadin as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Because Aerintra Pseudoephedrin contains, the drug is also contracted in patients who are treated with a monoaminoxidase (MAO) inhibitor and within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphamimetical activity in combination with other vasoconstrives, pergolid, Cabergolin, ergonomically or nasal, phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrin, Oxymetazolin, Napocolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">Safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient evaluation and the data is not sufficient to submit relevant recommendations to the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Safety and efficacy of aerobatics were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function. not enough to submit relevant recommendations to the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed about that treatment in the occurrence of hypertension or speedometer, heart rhythms, nausea or etaive other neurological symptoms (such as headache or gain of the headache) must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">In the treatment of following patient groups, patients suffering from DIGITALIS • patients with hypertension (patients with hypertension) patients with a myocardial infarction in the Anamese, Diabetes Mellitus, bladder, bladder and Bronchospasmus in Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze takes at least 48 hours before carrying out dermatological tests, since Antihistamine is otherwise reduced positive reactions to indicators for skin reaction or in their dimension.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical trials with Desloratadin, where erythromycin or Ketoconazol were administered in addition, there were no clinically relevant interactions or changes of plasma concentration by Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychological tests, no significant differences were detected between the desloratadin and the placebo-treated patients, regardless of whether Desloratadin alone or with alcohol is taken.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the Metabolism of Desloratadin responsible was not identified, so that interactions can not be excluded completely with other drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin inhibits in-vivo CYP3A4, and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The injustice of the use of Aerintra during pregnancy is not secured, but experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, does not increase the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since the reduction studies of animals not always transferred to humans and due to vasostriving characteristics of Pseudoephedrin, Aerintra should not be applied in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should however be clarified in fact that in very rare cases, it can lead to a impairment of traffic or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a cNS depression (sedation, apnee, dimined mental attention, cyanosis, Koma, cardiovascular collision) and a ZNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible lettuals.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, anxiety, muscle insufficiency, heart failure, nausea, nausea, nausea, vomiting, precordials, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxy, vision disorders and hypertension or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A cNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as Atropin typical symptoms (mouth dryer, turacillary arre and diliatation, skin cancer, hyperthermia, and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include the inhibiting of proinflammatory cytokinen as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-8 and IL-13 from human Mastcells / Basophiles as well as the expression of expression of expression of addressing the P selection of endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measuring sizes, including the amplification subjective slaughter or tasks that are connected to the flies.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical studies at the recommended dosage of 5 mg. daily no increased frequency of slitting times compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of Pseudoephedrin in the recommended dosage can cause additional symomimetic effects, such as an increase of blood pressure, a tachyarm or manifestations of a ZNS-pathogen.</seg>
<seg id="1693">There were 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic Rhinitis, 414 patients received aerobaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamantagonist efficacy of Aerinaze tablets, determined using the overall score for symptom (except Nasenmugerm swelling), significantly higher than under a monotherapy using Pseudoephedrin about the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of aerodynamic tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nose-mugermination, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy using desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of aerodynamic tablets showed no significant differences in terms of sex, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">In the context of a single dose study to pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, Desloratadin is detectable in plasma in 30 minutes after administration.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerobaze with healthy volunteers over 14 days, the flow weight of Desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and Pseudoephedrin was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the context of a pharmacokinetical multipurpose study, which was carried out with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult subjects, it was noted that four subjects Desloratadin bad missilly.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that exposure (Cmax and AUC) of Pseudoephedrin is equivalent to the exposure to a aerodynamic tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies to security spicology, toxicity at repeated treatment, to genotoxicity and for reproduction, the preclinical data with Desloratadin does not recognize any special hazards for mankind.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than their individual components, and the observed effects were generally consistent with the ingredients Pseudoephedrin.</seg>

<seg id="1722">Aerius was studied in eight studies involving about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic Rhinitis (including four studies in seasonal Rhinitis and two studies in patients who had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The efficacy was measured by using the change of symptoms (itchy, number and size of taddling, impairment of sleep and performance on the day) and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies were submitted to prove that the body uses the syrup, the solution to insert and use the melting tablet in the same way as the tablets and application for children harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">For allergic rhinitis, when the results of all trials took place, the two weeks of symptoms were taken together with 5 mg Aerius to an average decrease of symptom score (symptom points) by 25 to 32%, compared to the acceptance of 12 to 26% in patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In both studies in urticaria the decline of symptoms after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67% compared with placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be applied in patients who may be insensitive (allergic) against Desloratadin, Loratadin or one of the other components.</seg>

<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with Desloratadin tablets, where erythromycin or Ketoconazol were administered in addition (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical-pharmacological study NSC 631570 was not strengthened with alcohol and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">Patients should however be clarified in fact that it can be found in very rare cases that can lead to a impairment of traffic or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">Clinical studies in various indications, including allergic rystitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius, than in patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events, more frequently reported than placebo were tiredness (1,2%), mouth dryer (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study with 578 young people from 12 to 17 years, the most common adverse impact of headaches was treated with 5.9% of patients who were treated with Desloratadin and with 6.9% of patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multifacebook study, where up to 45 mg Desloratadin (ninety clinical dose) were administered, no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibiting of proinflammatory cytokinen, such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human Mastcells / Basophiles as well as the expression of expression of the expression of nohemorolis P selection in endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">In the context of a clinical study with multi-expertise, in the Desloratadin in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>

<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic Rhinitis can also be divided into intermittent allergic Rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As a result of the overall score on the quality of life at Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the stress due to seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronic idiopathic urticaria was evaluated as a representative for other forms of urticaria, since the underlying pathophysiology remains similar to the equology of different forms and chronic patient can be recalled.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the histamine impairs a causal factor in all urticular diseases, Desloratadin is also expected to improve the symptoms of chronic idiopathic urticaria, which is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in the improvement of Pruritus and the percentage of Quaddling at the end of the first dose intervals.</seg>
<seg id="1752">Like in other studies with antihistamperika in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who did not respond to antihistamine, from the study.</seg>

<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius reduced the disorder of sleep and wax, as measured by a 4-point scale for assessment of these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetics study, in which the patient data were comparable with the general seasonal Rhinitis population, 4% of patients showed a higher concentration of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no risk points for clinically-relevant cumulation after once daily application of Desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the Metabolism of Desloratadin responsible was not identified, so that interactions with other drugs will not be excluded</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin inhibits in vivo not CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single term study with Desloratadin in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (low-fat, calorie rich breakfast) is not limited to the availability of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The clinical trials conducted by Desloratadin and Loratadin carried out in a comparable degree in the exposition of Desloratadin, no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the toxicity of Desloratadin and of Loratadin.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of meals to reduce symptoms of allergic Rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribed doctor should be aware that most cases of Rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection (see below section 4.4) and that no data are prescribed for treatment of infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory symptoms or anatomical anomalies, the diagnosis should play anamnese, physical investigations and corresponding laboratory and skin studies.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabolic desloratadata is restricted and experienced a higher substrate load (see below section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children between 2 and 11 years, fully metabolized, is identical to the children who metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medication contains Saccharose and sorbitol; therefore patients with inherited problems of a fructose-intolerance, glucose-Galactose-absorbing or succulase inhibitor insufficiency should not take this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with Aerius tablets, where erythromycin or Ketoconazol were administered in addition (see section 5.1).</seg>

<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic Rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of Desloratadin in adults and children are similar, the efficacy data of Desloratadin in adults can be extrapolated to children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">In the context of a clinical study with multi-expertise in adults and adolescents, in the Desloratadin in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical-pharmacological study of adults and adolescents, in the Desloratadin in a dose of 45 mg daily (the Neunfold of clinical dose) was applied for over ten days in adults, there was no extension of the QTc intervals.</seg>

<seg id="1780">In clinical-pharmacological studies in adults, it came to an increase of alcohol not to gain the alcohol-induced power loss even to an increase of slender.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis Aerius tablets have been effective in the linting of symptoms such as Niesen, Nasensecretion and Juckreiz's nose, Juckreiz, Tränenary and Röcking of eyes as well as Juckreiz on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As a result of the overall score on the quality of life at Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius tablets have developed effectively the reronal allergic rhinitis caused by seasonal allergic</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in the improvement of Pruritus and the percentage of Quaddling at the end of the first dose intervals.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The spread of this limited phenotyps was comparable with adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6%) and in both populations larger at Black (18% adults, 16% children) than with Caucasian (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetical parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multifacial study with syrup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis observed.</seg>
<seg id="1786">The load (AUC) through Desloratadin was approx. 3 to 6 hours higher and the Cmax. 3 to 4times higher with an terminal time of about 120 hours.</seg>

<seg id="1893">In June 2008, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. officially declared the Committee on Humanities for Humanities (CHMP), that the company adopts its application for approval of Aflunov for prevention of avior H5N1 flu in adults and older people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be applied to protect against flu, which is caused by the strain of flu (type) H5N1 of influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine that could cause a strain of influenza, which could cause future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">An influenza pandemic breaks out if a new tribe of Grippevirus occurs slightly from man to humans, because people still have no immunity (not protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">Following the administration of the vaccine it recognizes the immune system contained in the vaccine production parts of Grippevirus as "physical foreign" and produces antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">This makes the immune system later in a contact with a Grippevirus of this Stamms quicker antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the virus mshell of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, detects the human body as body-strange), purified and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">A inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the scope of clinical data base was not sufficient for assessment of safety of vaccines, to meet the requirements of the EMEA for prepanic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Should you take part in a clinical study and need more information regarding your treatment, please contact your doctor's doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you wish for more information regarding the recommendations of the CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years applied to the human immunodeficiency virus of type 1 (HIV-1) which caused the purchased immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who can't swallow the capsules, the genase can not be used as a solution, but this can't be taken together with Ritonavir because the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenase should only be classified if the physician has examined the antiviral medicine of the patient previously made, and the likelihood has made that the virus may respond to the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, taken together with twice daily 100 mg Ritonavir and other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of generic according to body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Choroid was reduced in combination with other antiviral medicines the HIV-amount in the blood and keeps them at low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS does not need to cure AIDS, however, cannot delay the damage of the immune system and thus ensures the development of HIV infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Choroid was studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults, previously not been treated with Protocols.</seg>
<seg id="1912">This was compared with low-dosed ritonavir reinforced medicine Agenase was compared with 206 adults, which had previously been compared with other Protocols.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicators for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (Viral load) or the change of viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In studies with patients who had previously had no protector had been taken after 48 weeks under Agenase more patients had a viral load below 400 copies / ml, but Agenase was less effective than Indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenase also reduced the viral load, but was treated with the children who were previously treated with Protocols, only very few to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had been treated earlier with Protocols which had been treated with Ritonavir reinforced medicine Agenase the viruslast after 16 weeks of treatment as well as other Protocols:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV that was resistant against four other protector, it came under Agenase together with Ritonavir to a stronger apostasy of the viruslast after four weeks than in the patient who continued its previous protector:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common adverse events of Agenase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhea), nausea (nausea), nausea (nausea), vomiting, rash and Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenase should not be applied in patients who may be insensitive (allergic) against Ambavir or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenase can also not be applied in patients, the Johanniskraut (a plant preparation for treating depression) or medicines that are just like asgenase and are taken in high concentrations in the blood of health.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other drugs against HIV, Agenase take the risk of a lipodystrophy (alterations in the distribution of body fat), an osteonecrose (die from bone tissue) or an immunreactivation of syndroms (symptoms of an infection that are caused by the recovery of the immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Humanities (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Agenase in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1 intreated adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetist Amitonavir, but the Committee presented that the value of Agenase in combination with Ritonavir in combination with Ritonavir in patients who have previously not been detected.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Agenase was originally approved under "extraordinary circumstances" because of approval from scientific reasons only limited information.</seg>
<seg id="1925">October 2000 the European Commission granted the company Glaxo Group Limited for approval of the production of Agenase in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Generase is shown in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1- infected, protocolehemmer (PI) -treated adults and children from 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1927">For usual, Agenase capsules are to be given to pharmacokinetical booster of Ambavir together with low doses of Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Ambavir should be used in consideration of the individual viral resistance and the treatment of patients (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bio availability of Ambavir as a solution to intake is 14% lower than one capsule, hence Agenase capsules and solution are not interchangeable on a milligram per milligram basis (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenase capsules is 600 mg Ambavir twice daily along with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenase capsules are applied without the supplementary supplement of Ritonavir (booster), greater doses must be applied to Agenase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenase capsules is 20 mg Ambavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily highest dose of 2400 mg Ambavir, which should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, effectiveness and safety of genase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other proteasants were not examined with children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to the absence of data to inevality and effectiveness (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetical data, the dose of Agenase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders reduced to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The concurrent application should be done in patients with mild or moderate liver function, patient with severe liver function (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenase can not be used simultaneously with medicines that have a small therapeutic width and also display substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzyms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations that contain Johanniskraut (hypericum perforation) may not be applied due to the risk reductions and a reduced therapeutic effect of Ambavir during the intake of Ambavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be noted that Agenase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a healing of HIV infection, and that they may continue to develop opportunist infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The present antiretroviral therapy including treatment with Agenase does not prevents the risk of transfer from HIV to other by sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually Agenase capsules should be used together with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients who are treated in chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy, an increased risk of severe liver-effects with potentially fatal course.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant technical information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with preexisting reduced liver function, including a chronic hepatitis C, increased frequency of liver function under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous application of Agenase and Ritonavir with Fluticason or other Gluocortikoids, which will be changed over CYP3A4, is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment of systemic corneal eroider effects including Morbus Cushing and Suppression of the anniotic function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">As the digestion of the HMG-Coa Reducase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly recommended by CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of Agenase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin due to the increased risk of myopies including Rhabdomyolysen is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that may cause severe or life-threatening effects, such as Carbamazepine, phenylarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under the supervision of the International standard), methods are available to determine the active concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2035">The cover of the effectiveness of Agenase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized adult dose (600 mg twice daily) and nucleus analog (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, mainly with lowest Ritonavir "geboostert."</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred threescore (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity against Agenase, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI have been included in the substudy A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis provided the non-superiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group regarding the time adjusted average change of the initial value (AAUCMB) in plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-corrosive threshold of 0,4-10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The cover of the effectiveness of unroasted Agenase is based on two uncontrolled trials with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenase solution used to intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dosional Ritonavir at the same time; majority of patients treated with PI previously had at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs.</seg>

<seg id="2045">The administration of Ambavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Ambavir 12 hours of dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore the minimum concentration in the steady state (Cmin, ss) was unaffected by the dietary absorption, although the concurrent dietary absorption influences the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent tool volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg) and can be close to a large distribution volume as well as a balanced penetration of ambavir from blood circulation into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease of the total concentration of active ingredients in plasma, whereby the amount of unbound ampercavir, which represents the active share, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of non-bleached Ambavir remained constant, the percentage of free active ingredients during the dosing scale in the steady state concentration on the area of Cmax, ss up to Cmin, ss.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, mainly the safety of medication was investigated, however, it was measured as its effectiveness (by increasing its effectiveness in relation to the reduction of GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years, Aldurazyme increased its concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of them were treated at the end of the study a normal great liver.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common adverse events of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, nausea, abdominal pain, pain pain, pain in limbs (in hands and feet), heat feeling, fever and reactions to the infusion point.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very frequent side effects in patients under five years of increased blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurement size of lung function), speedometer (accelerated heart rate), fever and air-frost.</seg>

<seg id="2283">The manufacturers of Aldurazyme will receive patients who observe Aldurazyme as regards the reactions to infusion and development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">June 2003, the European Commission granted to Genzyme Europe B.V. a approval for the transit of Aldurazyme in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a combinant form of human α-L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using Cho-mammier cell cultures (Chinese Hamster Ose, Eighteenth of the Chinese Hamsters).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indexed in patients with secure diagnosis of a Muyysaccharides I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to handle the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should take place by a doctor, experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusions rate of 2 E / kg / h can be achieved if the patient can be increased every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">Safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years was not determined, and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined, and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients with Aldurazyme treated patients can develop infusible reactions, which are defined as each in connection, which occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion-box (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">Due to this reason, these patients should continue to be monitored, and the infusion of aldurazyme should only be carried out in a reasonable clinical environment in which resilient facilities for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical Phase 3 study, almost all patients had IgG antibodies against Laronidase, generally within 3 months of treatment of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusions, must be treated with care of Aldurazyme (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since a little experience in respect of treatment after a longer interruption, due to the theoretical increased risk provisioning must be careful after a interruption of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the start of infusion with medications (antihistamine and / or anti-python change) to minimize the potential of infusible reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of slight or medium-severe infusions, the treatment with anti-histaminated and paracetamol / Ibuprofen should be charged and / or a reduction of the infusion rate on half of the infusion rate, in which the reaction is.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, heavy infusions, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms have been brought to decline, treatment with anti-histamine and paracetamol / Ibuprofen is weakened.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction of infusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate.</seg>

<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be applied simultaneously with chloroquin or Procain, because a potential risk of an interaction with intracellular intake of Laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies can not be found on direct or indirect effects of pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data of newborn that were exposed to Laronidase above the mother's milk, it is recommended to do not silent during the treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were classified as infusible reactions, accounting for 53% of patients in phase 3 study (treatment duration of up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment duration of up to 1 year) were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Unwanted drug interactions in connection with Aldurazyme, who were observed during the Phase 3 study and older at a total treatment duration of up to 4 years, are frequently performed in the following table following the following skins: very common (≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related participation of the upper respiratory tracts and lungs in the prehistory, heavy reactions came up, including bronchospasmus, breathing, and facial levels (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children unwanted pharmaceuticals related to Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5, with predominantly serious evaporation form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months, are reported in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients it was within 3 months after the treatment of a serene version, with the patients at the age of 5 with a heavy failure rate (average daily after 26 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">By the end of the Phase 3 study (or until one of the early departure from the study), 13 / 45 patients were detectable antibodies (RIP) assay detectable antibodies, including 3 patients who never had come to Seroconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with missing up to a low antibody level, a robust reduction in GAG spike in Harn, while patients with high antibody titres was to determine a variable reduction in GAG in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the phase 3 study and one in the Phase 2 study) showed an marginal effect on the enzymatic laronidine activity in vitro, which seemed to affect the clinical efficacy and / or the reduction of GAG in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies does not seem to stand in connection with the incidence of adverse drugs, even if the occurrence of unwanted drug interactions are typically taken together with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The basis for the enzymusation Therapy is in one for the hydrolyse of accumulated subsidy and preventing a further accumulation of sufficient recovery of the enciration.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is rapidly taken out of the circulation and cells in the Lysosomes, most likely above Mannose-6-phosphatas receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study demonstrated the entire disease spectrum was the majority of the patients of the mean phenotype and only a patient pointed the heavy phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited when they had a forged expirational volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand for 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the efficacy were the percentage of the expected FEV and the absolute salads in the 6-minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were recruited for an open label extension study where they received another 3,5 years (182 weeks) every week 100 E / kg Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with Aldurazyme treated with the placebo group an improvement of lung function and the pathogens that is represented in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">In the open extension study, an improvement and / or excitement of this effects showed up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease of the expected-contingent FEV is not significantly higher and the total pulmonohydrate increased further proportionally to the height of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a hepic anomaly of treatment reached 22 (85%) until the end of the study a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a clear trash of the GAG mirror in Harn (µg / mg Kreatinin) was established, which remained constant at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogeneous humility between the patients, which was taken into account by using a combined final point, clinically significant changes in the 6-minute walking test, was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">It was conducted an open phase 2 study, mainly the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme in 20 patients were examined at the time of their recording in the study under 5 years of age (16 patients with the heavy failure form and 4 with the medium-run form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosing was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased GAG- mirror in Harn in week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size increase (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) was determined after the Z-Score for this age group The younger patients with the intermediate form form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the medium-run form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with severe evaporation form only limited or even no progress in Cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a Phase 4 study, investigations into pharmacological effects of various Aldurazyme metering schemes were carried out on the GAG mirror in Harn, the liver volume and the 6-minute test test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The metering scheme with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks may have difficulties with weekly infusions, a representative alternative; however it is not proven that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schemes is equivalent.</seg>

<seg id="2359">The active form of Pemetry slows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The conversion of Pemetrexed in its active form goes even in cancer cells lighter than in healthy cells, which leads to higher concentrations in the active form of medication and a longer time period of cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Alimta was investigated for the treatment of malignant Pleuramesothelift in a main study of 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy with their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">Treatment of non-cell lung cancer were compared to the effects of Alimta in a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease which were previously treated with chemotherapy with the effects of docetaxel (another drug against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was compared to gemcitabine (a further drug against cancer) and both in combination with Cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously won no chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>

<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to sufficient data for injustice and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical studies in patients with a Kreatinin-Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min, no dose adjustments required to go out over the recommended dose adjustments.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data base in patients with a Kreatinin-Clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction from &gt; to the upper picture value and / or transaminasenvalues of &gt; to 3.0 times the upper limit value (near liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0 times the upper limit value (in presence of liver metastases) was not tested specifically in studies.</seg>

<seg id="2526">Animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effects of pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or post-natal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and depend on the pharmacological effects of the medication, since the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Gastrointestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporarily.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The Frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on the available data).</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used for chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as Cisplatin), as well as chemotherapies, which are working for nausea and vomiting (like Cyclophosphate, doxorubicin or Carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">Aloxi's effectiveness can be increased by the additional gift of a Corticosteroids (a drug which can be used as anti-emetry).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application in patients under 18 years is not recommended because the effects in this age group is not enough for information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient prevents chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin) to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was examined in three main studies at 1 842 adults who received chemotherapies, which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, which are strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of those treated with Aloxi were treated in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 of 223), opposite 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron patients (126 from 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, who were treated for nausea and vomiting, 81% of those treated with Aloxi were treated in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron patients (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolasetron, these values stood at 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted the company of Helsinki's Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. a approval for the transit of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexed: to prevention of acute nausea and vomiting with strongly emetogenic chemotherapy due to severe cancer disease and prevention of malignant chemotherapy due to cancer disease.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi to prevention of nausea and vomiting, which is induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy, can be strengthened by adding one before the Corticosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Because Palonosetron can lengthen the colorectal passage should be monitored with anamnesty Obstipation or signs of a subacute Ileus after injection narrower.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution has been careful when using Palonosetron using medicines that extends the QT interval or in patients where the QT- interval extends or extending to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Except in connection with a further chemotherapeutics administration, Aloxi is to be used in the days after chemotherapy, nor for the treatment of nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies inhibited Palonosetron applied against tumours (Cisplatin, Cyclophosphate, Cycloabine, Doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study, no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between one single-up intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a steady concentration metocloprone, a CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a population-based pharmacokinetic analysis it was shown that the simultaneous gift of CYP2D6 Inhibitors (Dmioubicin, dooxetine, Paroxetine, Partralin, Ritonavir, Sertralin and Terbinafin) has no significant impact on the cleance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences for the application of Palonosetron in human pregnancies are not available, so Palonosetron must not be applied for pregnant women unless it is necessary to treat the doctor's treated doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical studies, the most common at a dose of 250 micrograms were observed (a total of 633 patients), at least possibly with Aloxi in connection, headaches (9%) and Obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of oversensitivity reactions and reactions to the administration location (burning, hardening, complaints and pain) were reported in post-marketing expertise.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar passages of unwanted events were observed in the other dosing groups; there were no dose of active relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies have been carried out due to the great distribution volume, a dialysis probably is probably not effective therapy at a Aloxi- Overdol.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients who received a moderate emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of Cyclophosphate (half-time 4 hours) or 100 mg Dolasetron (half-time 7.3 hours) received equivalent to day 1 without Damethason intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">A randomised double-blind study included 667 patients with ≥ 60 mg / m2cisplatin, as well as 250 mg / m2 cycyclophosphamide and Dacarbazine and 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron, which were compared to day 1 intravenously by day.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with strong emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical studies for the indication-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters were comparable with the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to the findings of clinical studies, Palonosetron owns the ability to block the ionary and Repolarisation involved and extend the duration of the shareholder.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The objective of the study conducted at 221 healthy volunteers were the evaluation of the EKG effects of i.V. administered in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous gift follows an initial decrease in the plasma concentration of a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal time of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentration time-time-curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally proportional in general in the entire dose range of 0,3- 90 μ / kg.</seg>
<seg id="2638">Following intravenous gift of Palonosetron 0.25 mg each second day for a total of 3 doses of 11 Hodencarcinoma patient between day 1 and day 5 measured medium (± SD) increase in the Palonosetron plasma concentration in 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacokinetical simulations, that, at once daily intravenous gift of 0.25 mg Palonosetron in 3 consecutive days reached total exposure (AUC0- ∞) with the equivalent value of 0.75 mg. however, the Cmax was equivalent to 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% will be eliminated about the kidneys, and approximately another 50% will be converted into two primary metabolic ites, which have less than 1% of the antagonist effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro studies on Metabolisation, CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 have been involved in the Metabolism of Palonosetron in a lower dimensions.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After a intravenous dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found approximately 80% of the dose within 144 hours of urine, Palonosetron as an unaltered drug made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a single-time intravenous Bolusinjektion, the total body weight amounted to 173 ± 73 ml / min and renal cleance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although patients with severe liver function, the terminal elifted elimination and the average systemic exposure of pallonosetron increases, a reduction of the dose is therefore not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In previous trials, effects were observed only after expositions that are considered adequate across the maximum human exposure to clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 Out of preclinical studies revealed that Palonosetron can block only in very high concentrations of Ionary channels, which are involved in the ventricular degeneration and Repolarisation.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose discharged in about 30 times of therapeutic exposure to humans) that were given daily for two years, led to a greater frequency of liver tumor, endocrine Neoplasmen (thyroid, pineesenmark) and skin tumors with rats, but not with mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not completely known, but due to the used dosing and Aloxi used for one-time application, the relevance of this results will be low as for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="2649">The holder of this approval for the market policy must notify the European Commission on plans for the market transport of the regulatory authorities in the framework of this decision.</seg>

<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns are ineffected that the data on the stability of the active ingredients and the product are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C that talked to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After adjusting the treatment with Alpheon the disease was inflammable with more patients than in reference to reference. in addition, Alpheon had also increased any side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">In addition, the test was included in the study to test the question, to what extent the medication forms an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug), not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used for the treatment of Impetigo (one with crust formation) and small intreated lainations (Rissor or slicing), dediced and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo is not to be used to treat infections, detectable or probably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), because Alarcon does not work against this type of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied in patients with the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years of age, the treatment area should not exceed 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to treatment in two to three days, the doctor should reexamine the patient and consider alternative treatments into consideration.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by block of bacterial reefs (the parts of bacterienzelle where proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">Main indicators of efficacy was in all five studies in the proportion of patients whose infection was sealed after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients with placebo said to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin wounds, Altargo and Cefalexin similar response: when the results were taken together with skin wounds, about 90% of both groups were enrolled on the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">However, in these two studies it was found that Altargo in the treatment of wastewardy sufferings in the body fabric) or of infections which were detectable or probably caused by MRSA, is not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common adverse impact with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation of the contractor.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Humanities (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Altargo on the short-time treatment of the following surface treatment: • Impetigo, • infected small infirations, dearising or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">May 2007 the European Commission granted the company Glaxo Group Ltd. a approval for the transit of Altargo throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients who show no improvements within two to three days are expected to be considered once and an alternative therapy are considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of a sensizing or heavy local Irritation by applying Retapamulin salts the treatment is canceled, the ointment is carefully shut down and an adequate alternative to the infection.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be applied for the treatment of infections where MRSA is known or suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical studies in secondary wounds the efficacy of retinapamulin was caused by infections which caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered to be considered for 2- or 3-day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected place.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The impact of simultaneous application of Retapamulin and other topical funds on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other topical medicine is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentration, which have been reached when people in topical skin or infected wounds have been reached, a clinically relevant shirts in vivo is not expected (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 According to the same gift of 2 times daily 200 mg Ketoconazol increased the mean Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax after topical application of 1% Retapamulin salts on a diced skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the small systemic exposure after topical use in patients, dose adjustments are not required, when topical Retapamulin is used during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a Reproductive-stoicity according to oraler and are inadequate in terms of consequences for the birth and fötal / post-natal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin salbe should only be applied during pregnancy when a topical antibacterial therapy is clear and the application of Retapamulin is the gift of a systemic antibiosis.</seg>
<seg id="2696">If the decision continued or terminate the breastfeeding or the therapy with Altargo / terminated, it is weakened between the benefit of the nursing and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, the Altargo was applied, the most frequently reported side effects of Irritation on the administration site which was about 1% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Efficiencies retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mechanism of action of retinapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein syntheses by interaction in a specific binding office of the bacterial giant of the bacterial Ribosomes which differs from the interventions of other ribosomal interagulating antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the ribosom ribosomales protein L3 is involved and in the region of ribosomal P-binding and the Peptidyltransferring centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By connective to this binding site hemorrutiline block the peptidyltransfer, block part P-binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50s ribosomaler subjects.</seg>
<seg id="2702">In the reason of the local prevalence of resistance, the use of Retapamulin at least some infectious diseases should be aimed at least by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in in-vitro activity of retinapamulin compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether insulated isolates or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the case of non-appealing to the treatment at S.aureus the presence of tribes with additional virultural factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption in a study with healthy adults was raised 1% Retapamulin salts daily under occlusion on intakingly and on shaking skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Out of 516 patients (adults and children), who received 1% of apapamulin salts twice daily for 5 days to the topical treatment of secondary wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Sample intake took place 3 or 4 in adult patients each prior to Mediation and during the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic recording in humans according to topical use of 1% Salbe on 200 cm2 (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng / h (h / ml) 660 times lower than the PGP inhibiting.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism in vitro oxidative metabolism of retinapamulin in human liver microsomes was designed primarily by CYP3A4, under low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies for oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg) carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro examination on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma test or in human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in rats-microcontroller to in-vivo study chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There were neither in male nor female nucleation of limited fertility at oral doses of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, which means that up to 5 times higher exposure was achieved as the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study on rats were ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (corresponding to the ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure (see above), development aid xicity (reduced body weight) and maternal toxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The owner of approval for the registration process must make sure that the Pharmacovigilanzsystem is present, as in the 1.8.1 module of the authorisation application (version 6.2), where the product is marketed and the product is used as long as the product's market is used.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The holder of approval for the inwarfare is obliged to perform detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilanzas, as described in version 1 of Risk Management Plan (RMP), as well as all additional updates of RMP, which will be agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for the inal products for human use," the updated RMP should be submitted simultaneously with the next periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms at the treated point, you should finish the application of Altargo and speak with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply any other salts, creams or lesions on the area that is treated with Altargo if it has not expressly accepted by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It cannot be used in eyes, mouth or lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">When the ointment comes out on one of these faces, wash the place with water and ask your doctor about advice, if complaints occur.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After the removal of the ointment you can cover the affected area with a sterile association or a Gazeassociation, unless your doctor have not to cover the area.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used for protection against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B (diseases that affect the liver) with children aged between one and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used in the context of two doses existing vaccine, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used when immunisation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection, and ensured that it can be run from two doses existing vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a cancellation dose against hepatitis A or B may be given, Ambirix or another hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines may occur by combining the immune system (the natural shotgun of the body), "as it can weave against a sickness.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface antigens as "strange" and produces antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components such as the vaccination Twinrix adults and the Twinrix children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect the same diseases, however, Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered in the context of three existing vaccinations.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix Adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults, also used as a letter for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicators for the efficacy was the proportion of overweight children who had developed a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the vaccine is compared with six months and a 12-month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix led a month after the last injection on hepatitis A and B between 98 and 100% of the imminated children after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of the Ambience of Ambirix was a six-month gap between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common adverse events of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccines) are headache, appetite, pain on injection, tube, matter (fatigue) and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not react to patients who may possibly react to the active substances, one of the other components or Neomycin (an antibiotic) must not be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2738">August 2002, the European Commission granted the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologetic s.a. a permit for the Inperation of Ambirix in the entire</seg>
<seg id="2739">The dimmet plan for the Grundimmer with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is given to the vote and the second dose ranges between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a review is required for hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B, it can be vaccinated with the corresponding monovent vaccines or combined with a combination.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B virus (anti-HbsAg) anti-hepatitis B virus (anti-HbsAg) and anti-hepatitis B virus (anti-HAV) anti-hepatitis C virus are observed in the same size rules as after vaccination vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet secured whether immunity individuals who have been addressed to an Hepatitis A vaccine, because they may also need more detectable antibodies since they are also protected by immune memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As for all injection levels, an anaphylactic reaction should be immediately available for the rare case of anaphylactic reaction after the gift of the vaccination corresponding possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a faster protection against hepatitis B is required, it is recommended that it contains 360 ELISA units formalin inactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In hematalysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies is achieved so that in these cases, further vaccines may be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Because a intraocular injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a subsidy sufferers, these injectors should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In these cases, the rorombocytopenia or blood circulation disorders may be injected, as it can be injected in these cases after intramuscular administration.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was given in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined Diphtherio, Tetanus- and Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or with a combined masern- mumps vaccine, the immune response was sufficient to all antigens (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients suffering from immunophonic therapy or in patients with immunomial defects, no adequate immune response is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study, associated with 3 vaccines of this formulation in adults was the frequency of pain, rocking, swelling, Matcha, headache and fever, comparable with the frequency that was observed at previous Thiomerang and preservative vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical studies, 2029 vaccine doses have been administered at a total of 1027 Impairings at the age of 1 to and including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 up to and including 15 years, the compatibility of Ambirix was compared to the 3-cans combination.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher Frequencies of pain and Mats at a calculation base per vaccination: Ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix at 50.7% of the subjects, compared to 39.1% of the subjects after receiving a dose of 3-cans.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the complete vaccination cycle, 66,4% of the subjects had given the Ambirix, over pain, opposite 63.8% in the subjects who had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of Mats was comparable to each test (i.e., over the whole vaccine cycle at 39.6% of the subjects, the Ambirix was compared to 36.2% in the subjects who received the 3-cans combination.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of impregnated pain and pain was low and comparable to the combination of the combination-layer with the 3-cans ocinema.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1- and 11-year-old Impairy, the occurrence of local actions and general actions in the Ambience group comparable with the 3-doses combined with 360 ELISA units formalise inactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11- year-old, however, after vaccination with Ambirix a frequency of pain (at the injection point) per dose, was not reported per prodband.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of Impairingen, who reported above heavy side effects during the 2-cans vaccination schemas with a 360 ELISA- units formalin inactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface treatment, was statistically not different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical studies that were conducted at Impflingen, aged 1 to and including 15 years, the serum rates for anti-HAV 99.1% were one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second, for month 6 abbreviated dose (d. h. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The rates for anti-HBS were 74.2% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second, for month 6 abbreviated dose (d. h. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparable study that was carried out in 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 were given the standard combinants with three cans.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 people whose immunogenicity was impaired, the seroprotates rates (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 were significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immunity, which were achieved in a clinical study period of 1 to 11-year-olds one month after the completion of the full vaccination series (i.e., in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the Impairinge were either a 2-cans vaccines with Ambirix or a 3-cans vaccination with a combination of 360 ELISA units formalin activated hepatitis B virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2767">For individuals who were aged between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after immunisation with Ambirix in the 0-6 months vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunity reaction observed in this study was comparable to vaccination of 3 cans using a combination-based hepatitis- A-virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose of 0,5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study of 12- to including 15-year olds could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies are comparable to immunisation in the 0-6 months vaccine scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix in the second year of life with the collection of a combined Diphtherio, tetanus-, azellulorem, inactivated poliomyelia (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or was administered with the first dose of a combined measles-mumps vaccine, the immune response was sufficient to all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study involving 3 doses of this present formulation was performed in adults, showed similar seroprotations and seroconical rates such as for earlier versions.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is available both before and after resusation by eye level on any foreign particles and / or physicalically visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2778">You can feel very tired, have a dark urine, a red face, yellow skin and / or eyes (yellowing) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2779">Like all vaccines, Ambirix cannot protect it completely in front of an infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus, even if the full vaccination series was completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you are infected / your child before the administration of both vaccines Ambirix is already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus (though you / your child does not feel unlikely or sick) may not prevent a disease.</seg>

<seg id="2785">With a potential risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the physician is given to you / your child from a vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, it will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective components per vaccination (360 ELISA units of a formalinactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface antigens).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination of this vaccine with reduced content of effective components is usually administered a month after the first dose and should give you a vaccine protection before termination of the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes, Ambirix is injected with people suffering from severe blood circulation, under the skin and not in the muscle, if you are weakened / her child under a disease or treatment in your / her body's body or if you / her child is undergoing a hematalysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these persons on the vaccine can not be sufficient, so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the response to vaccination is necessary.</seg>

<seg id="2792">If another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambirix, it should be vaccinated in separate areas and as possible different limbs.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is given to the same time or shortly before or after a injection of Immunlobbies, it is likely that the response to the vaccine is still sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Normally, Ambirix pregnant or lactating women is not administered, except it is urgently needed that they are vaccinated against hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B.</seg>

<seg id="2881">This can help patients with angina or heart failure to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of one PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study about the treatment of ACS with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug to prevent blood clots) with conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another antibody) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">While the PCI was frequently used a stent (a short tube that remains in the Arterie to prevent a closure), and they received additional drug to prevent blood clots, such as Abciximab and Aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS was Angiox - with or without gift of GPI - at preventing a new events (deaths, cardiac disease or revolascularisation) after 30 days or a year, as well as the conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who were subjected to a PCI, Angiox was as effective as Heparin, except for severe bleeding, with which it was much more effective than Heparin.</seg>

<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in combination with a slow insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, where the body can't produce insulin, in two trials with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, when the body insulin had not been effective, Apidra was examined in a study with 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicators for the efficacy was the modification of the substance glycerated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how good the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with type 1 diabetes after six months a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a decrease of 0.14% in insulin per capita.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction of the HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% compared to humanem Reginsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be applied in patients who are potentially insensitive (allergic) against insulin or one of the other components, or in patients who suffer from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The cans of Apidra may need to be adapted when it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can work on blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH approving a approval of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as a subcutaneous injection either in the field of abdominal ceiling, or to apply subcutaneous using continuous infusion in the area of abdominal cavity.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced glucose levels capacity and the lower insulin supply, the insulin need to be reduced in patients with a restriction of the liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the active effect, the brand (Her- Steller), the insulin (normal, NPH, pre-delayed, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or production method can draw a change in the insulin requirement.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An insufficient dosage or demolition of treatment, especially in patients with a insulin-dependent diabetes, can lead to a hyperglycemia and diabetic ketacia; these states are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The changeover of a patient to another insulin-type or a insulin of another manufacturer should be carried out under stringent medical supervision and can make a change of dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The effect of a hypoglycemia depends on the active profile of the insulin and can therefore change at the conversion of treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">To increase the substances that increase the blood sugar beating activity and the inclination to hypoglyphic DNA (ACE) inhibitor, dispersion, diopric oxidiase (MAO) inhibitor, pentoxifylline, propoxyz, salicylic and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of Sympatholytics, such as inlockers, Clonidine, Guanethidine and reserve the symptoms of admirroid, or missing or missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies for reproductive-stoicity showed no differences between Insu- linglulisin and humaninsulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, the birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insinglulisin into human breast milk occurs but in general, insulin must not be addressed in breast milk, nor is absorbed by oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are those of clinical trials known to which adverse drugs are listed, grouped according to system organs and arranged according to declining frequency of their efforts (very often: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 100; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000;</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold welding, cool and flashing skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, nervousness or weakness, confusion, concentrations of visual acuity, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Will be missed to change the injection station within the injection area, may occur a lipodystrophy on the injection station.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Heavy hypoglyCheese with consciousness can be given by using a intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glukagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by a doctor accordingly by an intravenous gift of glucose.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucose projection, the patient should monitor the patient in a hospital to determine the ur- cause for the heavy hypoglycemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose intake (especially through skeleton musculature and fat) as well as by inhibiting of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that subcutaneous fermentation process occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than at hu- manem normal normal.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male persons aged between 21 and 50 years with type 1 diabetes, insinglulin showed a proportional increase in a therapeutic reduction factor of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg, and a proportional increase in a high-proportional increase in the low cost reduction effect, exactly like humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insinglulisin has twice as fast activity occurs such as a normal human insulin and achieved a complete gluing effect about 2 hours earlier than humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was evident that when an application of insinglulisins in 2 minutes before meal a similar postprandially glycemic control is achieved as with humanem Reginulin which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insinglulisins were geared in 2 minutes before meal, a better post-postoperative control was given as with humanem Reginsulin which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insinglulisin 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal is turned, a comparable glycemic control is given as for human Reginsulin, which is given 2 tends before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin delivery in gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - previously) before the beginning of the meal was given (Figure 1A) as well as compared to humanem Reginulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal was given (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin at gift 15 minutes (GLULISIN - after the beginning of the meal compared to human Nor- malinsulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
