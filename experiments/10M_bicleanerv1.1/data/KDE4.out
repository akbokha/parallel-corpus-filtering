&amp; digi@@ plug ; contains a fast image processing with basic machine processing tools . you can use these to evaluate your photos , comment and correct . the processing capacities can be easily extended with K@@ DE image plug@@ ins ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ plug is ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support raw conversion by means of li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC @-@ color workflow .
improved database with much more met@@ ad@@ ata , such as &amp; eg ; on the camera or lens , can be sought .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ plug ; an open source project . that means , it is based on the support of the En@@ dan@@ ces . you should therefore report problems and improvement .
&amp; digi@@ plug , the mel@@ ody is trying to do so as possible for them . where , if you are using this link menu , your web browser does not open a page in error correction system . all required information are listed here . follow only the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; is a project that is supported by a community . if you have a regular user from &amp; digi@@ plug ; we would like to answer any questions on other users of &amp; digi@@ us ; however , we hope to answer any questions about other users . in this mail@@ ing@@ list is spoken in English , you should be in English .
you can also visit the digi@@ plug ; homepage to visit news about free @-@ given versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ plug ; to learn .
the best start to join &amp; digi@@ plug ; registration is in the developer &apos;s ma@@ iling list . guidance for registration in the developers ma@@ iling list of &amp; digi@@ plug came ; .
if you come &amp; digi@@ plug ; for the first time you will be asked where you want to specify your images and your database . you can simply specify a local , remote or remote folders . enter the folder icon to select a folder .
in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here you will find data ab@@ n@@ k . this path stays equal to all image folders .
later you can add so many folders as you want to add . &amp; digi@@ plug ; will you also use as Al@@ ben@@ library . Settings digi@@ K@@ am
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder where the images contains , as a base folder . no picture is changed . during the search of the folder you get a progress indicator to see them :
&amp; digi@@ plug ; dur@@ o recur@@ sive the library path in its entire depth . you can &apos;t miss any sub@@ folder , unless it is in hidden folders . this allows you to insert it up &amp; digi@@ plug ; do not get a point before the name of the Unter@@ ord@@ ner .
if you have a exist@@ ent file with photos as base folder , you will notice that the albums at My Al@@ ben@@ List have no photos than symbols . you can change it by using a popular photo from the album and then use this on the folder icon . more details are available in the section albums .
once you have configured the base folder you can set up in &amp; digi@@ plug ; you should learn your digital camera . after that you should learn how to use my albums and my sample box to manage your photos into the albums .
raw data support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , so it can handle &amp; digi@@ plug ; the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to figure out whether a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu Help Roh@@ kam@@ er@@ a@@ Support .
how to configure this and with raw files are described in paragra@@ phs Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h operations .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera station will provide you with your digital camera and you can download them directly in &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can download more than 1000 digital cameras . of course , each medium and each card reader is supported by your operating system , with &amp; digi@@ plug ; together with &amp; digi@@ plug .
modern digital cameras are characterised by using Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEEE @-@ 1394 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera will then be realised as a disk drive . the camera can also be realised as a disk drive . the camera can also be realised via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras are used to connect the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; used the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for communication with digital cameras , which has been developed continuously increasing numbers of over 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , which has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images of digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general files are ob@@ sol@@ ete and transfers via the serial port are slowly . &amp; digi@@ plug ; supports these cameras and leads the transmission of the images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ ale 2 needs to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support , the EX@@ IF support is required for some lib@@ g@@ ale 2 camera switches . if the EX@@ IF support is not available in lib@@ g@@ Flash 2 , you can &apos;t need any images or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things to &amp; digi@@ plug ; is how easy to extend its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE image plug@@ ins Project ( manual ) is a joint module structure for &amp; digi@@ plug ; , K@@ Photo@@ album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules of all graphical programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can be manipul@@ ating in almost any way , as it can also be a user . its advantage consists in that it is much easier , &amp; digi@@ plug ; by writing a small module to complement one function as the changes in &amp; digi@@ plug ; even perform themselves .
to simpli@@ fy the window , you can either remove the side bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change in full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
the drag and pull of pictures works everywhere : you can lay a picture in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ms , over the horizontal separ@@ ating line or in another application window . the only limitation is that a picture can not be found in keywords , data list or search .
- a file selection allows you to find out the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio
the text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . so the fil@@ tering on the fil@@ en@@ ame only if the ind is displayed , which can be displayed in the dialog of the settings .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ fe@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . these albums can be saved in a single album , after the name of its collection in the Al@@ ben@@ Properties or after the date which the album has been created first . the date can be changed in the properties of the album .
if you have a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select your album impor@@ ting pictures scan . you can also add a screen photo directly to an album . select Album impor@@ ting screen photo .
to copy or move a picture from one album to another or move the photo with the mouse to the target album and let it drop there . you can also move the picture via shi@@ fting or copy . you can simply copy all photos from and move it to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties , it allows you to enter information about this collection . to view the album properties , you need to select with the right mouse button on the album and edit in the context menu album Alb@@ um@@ properties .
Alb@@ um@@ - collections : are a method to select your albums , so you can select under a joint name . the collection will be used to sort your photos , if you want to add or delete albums from the collection . if you want to add new collections or want to delete this in the settings .
the Alb@@ um@@ - Date : is used when you albums your albums after date with view albums after date .
the buttons El@@ ders , average , latest : this setting the date on the oldest , the latest image or the average of the album . at first , it will be tempted to calculate the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this is missing , the last change of each file is used in this folder .
if you first opened an album in &amp; digi@@ plug ; the first picture in the album as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ can quot ; selected . this is why the first picture in the album is not representative and you want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as a album icon , you must select the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu &amp; quot ; when Alb@@ um@@ bran@@ t quot ; select . in addition , you can put the picture on the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be hired .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; supports the input of key@@ word for individual photos in the top window . album collections have a different effect . the collection includes always all photos of the album . you can naturally use both methods to organize your photos .
the picture window presents you the main view of your photos . if you can select an album , all pictures will be displayed in the picture window . each photo is displayed in a preview window , you can adjust the size of this presentation with the two l@@ up@@ ars in the tool@@ bar .
if you can open a record the first time , you must wait for short while waiting pictures . you can avoid that you can re@@ generate all the pictures in the menu .
information on each picture will be displayed below the corresponding preview . what information is possible , you can change via Settings digi@@ plug ; select here the albums side and custom@@ ize the area pre@@ ferences to your wishes .
the images feature Hil@@ s@@ window , the issue . if you let the mouse poin@@ ter a moment to rest on a picture . the help shows the main features including all tags of a photos . the screen photo above in the section introduction to the main window shows such a help window .
photos are all about how it comes with &amp; digi@@ plug . albums and tags allow you to organize your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to these . you can achieve all the functions that can be reached with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can choose from the context menu of the preview or menu picture in the menu bar . you have the choice between viewing the images , a slide or the processing of the pictures .
you can open the image processing with a photo by using either F4 image processing ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button . image processing will find a guide as you can edit your photos . using the image processing you can view your photos and change them .

you should note that after processing due to other image processing programs , the data can &apos;t store with the met@@ ad@@ ata . some programs do not store this data using the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , bl@@ ending etc .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; provides two possibilities available to the rotation . the easiest way is to select and choose the right mouse button on the preview and select a turning point . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photos , you can click with the right mouse button on the preview and F2 ren@@ aming from the context menu . note that you will keep the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ ti@@ f , &amp; etc . ) .

the view &amp; quot ; My data sli@@ der ; organizes your photos from the data . &amp; digi@@ plug ; used either the EX@@ IF date or if this is not available , the date of the last change of file .
if you select one month from the list , all photos of this month are shown in the image view . you can select days or weeks in the date panel below in the date view , so you can only show you the photos of the selected days .
photos with key@@ word provides a flexible and powerful possibility to organize and catalog@@ s . tags are st@@ ic@@ kers to be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . once a key@@ word has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this key@@ word or search again .
if a key@@ word is selected , all photos are marked with this key@@ word .
tags can be sorted in a hier@@ arch@@ ical tree . you can extract your keywords . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; my key@@ word &amp; quot ; together , so you can find the keywords that you are looking to find .
the keywords will be stored in a database for fast access and assigned key@@ word into the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your tags in other programs . furthermore , the tags will be imported into the loss of the database , once &amp; digi@@ plug ; the pictures are noted .
you can add new keywords by clicking with the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My sample password ; or if you have a new key@@ word , after you have a new key@@ word , after you have clicked on an existing key@@ word , this key@@ word will be key@@ word from this key@@ word .
you can delete a key@@ word by clicking on the key@@ word with the right mouse button and delete it . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo will not be deleted by this photo .
you can change the position of a sample by drag it to the desired position in the tree , and then a menu which gives you the possibility to move the key@@ word . a key@@ word can be only once a tree in a tree .
you can change the characteristics of a key@@ word by clicking it with the right mouse button and select the text of the key@@ word and the icon in tree &amp; quot ; change my key@@ word quot ; change .
to select another photo as a album icon , you need to select the picture with the right mouse button and click on the context menu . in addition , you can put the picture on the album in the list to set it as a symbol .

&amp; digi@@ plug ; character@@ izes each picture by a long number with special technology , the hair algorithm . these enables pictures to compare these signatures . depending on the difference between two images , each more are applied . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area in which you can fall every picture to find a similar picture . if you push a picture of somewhere on the symbol of un@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can fall there .
sketch : draw a fast sk@@ et@@ aker : draw a fast sk@@ et@@ rack and digi@@ plug ; finds the matching pictures . also here , a sw@@ elling value can be set .
this rider does an intuitive card search tool available on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can move it out with the mouse wheel . press C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker mouse button to pull out a square . all pictures within this coordinates will be filtered and displayed . this is what you need to include your pictures of G@@ eo data .
in the bottom , you can specify a name for your G@@ eo filter . this will then be added for a later use of the list below . it works like a Live Ge@@ o@@ folder .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; provides a light table in a separate window available with which you can compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , also raw files together .
select one or more pictures from any view in the main window , and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L To the fluorescent option . the selection will be added to the light table and opened its window . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ plug ; main window can be opened quickly with L Extras .
you can drag the pictures which you want to compare , in the left or right area of the window , where you can see a copy of the tool@@ bar and perform there . if you preview synchron@@ ize from the tool@@ bar , then you will perform this with the other image , then you can compare these images from the other image .
another mode is better suited to convert quickly from a picture series . if you want to navigate in pairs of tool@@ bar , the two first pictures are automatically loaded into the areas . if you use the left mouse button on any picture to view it on the left side . this could be shown in the right area . this simpli@@ fies it by a number of similar pictures .
of course , the normal soldering actions can also work directly from the lumin@@ ance as e.g. F4 file ...
all image information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both keys in the light table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ v@@ elling function , which you need to see the visible section of the image , you must click this click and see the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the mode preview , both pictures will show the same image .
the zo@@ oming works as in other views . simply use the zoom knob below the images or C@@ tr@@ l ; Maus@@ rad in the image in and beyond zo@@ oming . this happens in both pictures if you are in the mode preview .
what is a digital data management - after the conclusion of the process after the final issue and the permanent storage , each part of the picture has taken up to the final edition and the permanent storage . each of the photos will be sc@@ anned , sc@@ anned or digital photos , but most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , find a plan and practical tips as you can use your pictures , you can use and use photos again . we look at the process for digital photographs , remove , convert , group , to use , evaluate , ass@@ essing , optim@@ ism , wait , waiting and expor@@ ting image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital stock management particip@@ ates , indi@@ an , categorized , ensures , transformed , transformed , and exported content which is a mon@@ etic or cultural value . quot ;
met@@ ad@@ ata are defined as data about data . met@@ ad@@ ata are defined in accordance with your definition data , which will provide information about or managed by any application or environment .
I am able to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you will do not know how many photos you have , then do not use &amp; digi@@ plug ; if you don &apos;t want to store the met@@ ad@@ ata both in a database as well as in the image files , you can use very fast seeking and secure archi@@ ving to you with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you will do and know before you want to be organized into your system , the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . you must decide whether other access to your photos should be saved or on a network drive &amp; etc . make sure you need to move on a larger drive .
perhaps you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly about your location . if you have enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folder as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for images which print or publish on a website .
professional photograph@@ ers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing photos , archi@@ ving , work processes , constant supply of pictures to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % Archive and 5 % work files and you will not want to organize your structure for this content .
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the stack @-@ processing easier . do new from old files .
the separation of original and operating files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are searching for an original or a derived picture .
we also recommend to activate the met@@ ad@@ ata option in the installation page of the met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; digi@@ plug ; this ensures that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data will be written in the file . if you forget , you can then select the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database in the files by clicking the corresponding point in the menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change it ? with it &amp; digi@@ plug it is a met@@ ad@@ ata editor for a number of selected attri@@ bute . these are of course the most important .
now the real work , since you should select every photo key@@ word , and you should select all the images that will need the same attri@@ bute if you start with the same attri@@ bute . this makes sense when you can concentrate on top of the best photos .
let us now touch with key@@ word , keywords , such as you are often hot in other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ onym@@ s for the same thing .
if you import catalog@@ ed images from another source of embedded sample , then add &amp; digi@@ plug ; automatically add the tree to you and can be easily done by the drag of a sub @-@ tree to another . they will be updated by &amp; digi@@ plug ; updated while there are under@@ trees .
the graph shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata . this is a very rough representation , since each block of met@@ ad@@ ata in truth consist of many sections . data names and calendar data features all pictures .
enough of words - the next section refers to labelling or comments using the third important tool to kat@@ alog@@ ise your met@@ ad@@ ata .
you want to leave most ni@@ em@@ akers your photos just , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photograph@@ ers and agencies . they are certainly interested in how your photos arrive .
look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a nice beach panorama . if you are closer to view , then catch some details , people , the place .
and now I say that this is the landing area of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . Wow ! one begins to dream associations , memories , the historical period of time is again present , you may even hear the silence . so the labels has been changed completely .
for others who consider your photos can be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you are showing pictures you should tell a story . think the key is the meaning of the viewer to help Him . help you understand what you understand what you understand .
it is OK when an image is not perfect , if it has the strength only with a label for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can also use a much text in an inter@@ national@@ ised alp@@ habet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) , then you can export to your images in web galleries , then you will tell you a second time in web galleries . you need to tell the story so for the opening of the web site .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find in another city without navigation system ? was it not a bor@@ ing planet before Google Earth ? good , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now already with light speed .
the possibilities for ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alisation are already in@@ numer@@ able and will be able to open a deeper place in the future , and can also be able to open your journeys using Google Earth . you can also show the photos at reception location . you can also show the pictures at reception location . you can also export the pictures even to Gall@@ ery@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc . you can export to Google Earth viewer .

the following description says you what information is on the installation page of &amp; digi@@ plug ; as information should be deposited :
author ( syn@@ onym for Er@@ ition@@ er and Writ@@ er ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the photographer , for example , if it was not desired to be the name of the photographer , then it should not be changed . after this value , it should not be changed . this field does not support sem@@ mas nor Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ ons as a partition .
Aut@@ ort@@ itel ( syn@@ onym for author ) : linked to the author . this field contains the work name of the photographer . examples of this field can be title as : employee photographer , Free photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a mer@@ k to the car field , this also has to be filled out .
publisher ( Syn@@ onym for providers ) : do not use the memory card to identify the photo . if the photographer is responsible for a message such as Reuters or Associated Press , you can do this organizations here . if the picture is a storage photo , then the Group / Agency will offer this picture here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they have no more protection against mis@@ use . anyone who have a little more than basic know in work with calcul@@ ator , these are digital water@@ marks . for individuals , this is important for the majority of your photos only of low interest . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique . &amp; digi@@ plug is unique . &amp; digi@@ plug ; is available in the near future , such a module for st@@ acker processing .

of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the road or a fire . these kind of losses are the same which can happen to you with traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section there are problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics which has the reasons for data loss .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs they must be treated , and you may not have any longer than a few years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality . there are offers over gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 that have a lifetime of 100 years for yourself . whether you believe it is in your discre@@ et@@ rack .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you can use good dis@@ ks and good recording devices . the best DVD recording devices are not much more reliable than the cheapest way , but you are much reliable . it turns out to select the right .
CDs and DVDs are very vulner@@ able for mist@@ akes , even if you have just been written only . therefore , they use a control system to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for the form@@ att@@ ing and the control sum@@ s . despite these massive protection words they are required by chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc .
for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs there is a reasonable program called I@@ so@@ B@@ uster , which runs on Windows and &amp; Linux , but is not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications the damaged data of damaged disks , hard disks , Flash@@ media , USB drives etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to save the format of DVD to HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disk can store 50 GB and therefore almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . everything was said to CD and DVDs , of course also for the Blu @-@ ray disk .
burn slowly with a good capture device to high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ etary format . read the media with a description , date &amp; author label and then place on a clean , dark dry and locally protected site . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest hardware or software that this media can read .
flo@@ ppy disk provides your statistics for themselves . their manufacturers guarantee a new disk , but not the data . Google presents a large field study about the error mechanisms of hard drives available : dis@@ mis@@ si@@ can
in brief : dis@@ ks keep the trouble when you are operated in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . some of SM@@ ART could not notice the error . some of SM@@ ART could termin@@ ate the error . these are particularly reading and publishing signs . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is a complete loss due to over@@ voltage due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to a current account before you have secured the files , but this losses can normally be expanded without any major problems .
while most electric devices are not much account , these can take heavy damage . at your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause severe loss of data loss , complete data loss , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . protect themselves before the in@@ ev@@ itable that leads to a loss of time and money .
most popular protection against electricity peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that a part of the energy seats absor@@ bs and the rest . it is usually in the form of a plug @-@ in strip . remember that not each plug @-@ in strip contains a over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a specific minimum of protection . you should also make sure that it protects protection against flash and thus protects the properly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage can be connected to your computer , you should also make sure that all periph@@ er@@ als are connected to your system . some manufacturers can also include over@@ voltage socket which also include a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modems and the TV map .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specifically designed for not@@ eb@@ ooks and therefore also contain the protection for the modem . so you are ideal for travelling .
while a over@@ voltage protection of your system is used in the power lines , it will not really help you . even a few seconds can lead to the loss of adverse data . it can therefore be meaning@@ ful in an un@@ interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protection against over@@ ten@@ sions , these devices can automatically store your data . this gives you the possibility of converting your data . if you have a US@@ V , you should be sure that they are the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the enclosed software can be interesting .
consider the potential risk to avoid your computer system , and compare his safety for current dysfunction with the cost to avoid this . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is only a small price difference if you think , you should always remember all the cable before you go into the holiday .
the Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - easy storage service . with the right configuration , you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . Google Sh@@ ared Storage is another popular range with you to save any quantity of data .
they are very expensive compared to the hard drives , however very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollar , 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data about compar@@ atively slow Internet .
solutions are therefore suitable as a solution for a local data loss of the most important pictures . it is not a bad solution but it is not a general backup solution . it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com are available online . its professional variant is not available in full resolution online . the professional variant is more available to you in case of Fli@@ ck@@ r dramatically . for $ 25 per year you will receive unlimited memory , which should be reviewed in reality .
from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very safe . transfer errors will be automatically included , thanks to the TCP protocol , and with the big companies it is included in the offer a backup and a partial storage .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the calcul@@ ator . all trans@@ missions are due to transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem z@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs ensure the data integral between operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing is that nobody says when a transmission error occurred . all this distur@@ ban@@ ces remain un@@ spot@@ ted until you have destroyed during your surprise . nobody seems to have been thinking about it . nobody seems to have thought about it . nobody seems to have been thinking about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much more reliable data way than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are a further source of transmission losses , since they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently not affected by transfers problems you should see in the future . as early as 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS by Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems seems to be one of two candidates . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GPL license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is available soon for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched an own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs system . it is still in the Alpha status . it uses the same protective mechanisms that uses z@@ fs and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
under@@ estimate that these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in not@@ ebook and 46 % at the workplace systems . in case of not@@ eb@@ ooks , the proportion of theft is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less widespread than most . it leads to a lower damage , as such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; lin@@ ux ; no longer has been observed .
open source file systems are less vulner@@ able to data loss as propri@@ etary systems : wrong , N@@ TF@@ S is minimal than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the common file systems . you can find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during one operation is higher and a defin@@ ite status is avoided before the problem occurred , she is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings of fundamental physical limits . it is meant that the technology continues to develop a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and rough@@ ts characteristic for all types of light sensors are not far away from this border .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ apix@@ els sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the final result more deterior@@ ate . a sensor size of 6 Megapixel and a high @-@ quality optics are the optim@@ isation for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have a full format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ GB hard drive are available today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make any data loss for data loss . make your data often come after a plan and test this backup before using any risk as the new installation of your operating system , replacing records or the size of the hard drives .
suppose you make your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash , you are lucky if the drive was not connected to the moment .
a Des@@ aster proposes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . do not forget by plane , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house .
therefore , Des@@ crip@@ tions always means non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up to the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of the physical separation : as above already said is a common reason for data loss despite backup the pan@@ ic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all the files will be secured . it is a moment recording without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differentiation : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup has been changed . generates a complete torque at two time points : the complete insurance policy and the latest differential backup .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of files that have been changed since the last backup . you can restore the original status to any time again . this backup comes to a ver@@ sion@@ ing system at the next with the exception that it is only dis@@ get@@ ed and not continuing .
r@@ sync is a wonderful tool which can easily copy to your machines . unlike a script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file trans@@ missions . this happens only the difference of files that really changed . this happens when you want to increase safety over ss@@ h .
secure important pictures directly after you saved them on your computer on a DVD or another optical media .
this approach lets you need enough time to discover losses and restore . at the end , you will have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly moment of performance for at least one month and a moment intake for every month . each additional th@@ inner should be manually taken after which you have made a complete review .
topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , stored in image file , IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original store , storage , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ locate pictures and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy the images onto the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visual equipment , ... , using the Internet .
to survive valuable pictures the next 40 year , that is about the period in which you really interested in you because they should remember your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
since the future is un@@ fore@@ se@@ eable , you must look at all this day . unfortunately , there is no other way to manage . unfortunately , there is no other way to manage . all 5 @-@ 8 years should ask oneself like the current system back@@ ward . if less variants you have used in the past , it is easier to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtualization is now available for everyone . if you have an old system that is important for reading your images , then store it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and back@@ ing technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to a newer standard . continue with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist printing for the possibility to change a system in its size . it actually means to enlarge .
let &apos;s go out that you have the scal@@ ability with in@@ planning and the area you want to zoom on a dedicated table or partition . at * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this range and transfer to a new record :
check out with the command d@@ mes@@ g whether your new record was detected by the system , but do not depend on it .
&amp; / dev / SD@@ B / dev / SD@@ B , the new record is / dev / S@@ DC # Source : / dev / S@@ DC / S@@ DC # Source can be / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in MB@@ gt ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , FAT@@ 16 , 32 and Reis@@ er@@ FS &amp; dollar ; resi@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / fried c@@ 1 # change the size of Reis@@ er@@ FS if necessary
open Source Standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if a day no software can be read , then you can create this itself . this task is easier for year .
GIF is a propri@@ etary , patented format which dis@@ appears slowly from the market . so you should not use it anymore .
PNG has been developed as an open source standard , but it can be much more . it is loss freely , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ ad@@ ata , 16 @-@ bit pro color channel and full transparency . it is that there is relative many administration information , but not as many as TIFF and a slow compression . this format would like to save you to save your images .
TIFF was widespread as image format . TIFF can store images in high quality , but requires very large files . with some cameras , you can custom@@ ize your images in this format . a problem is however that this format has been adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital neg@@ atives file format is a licensed and open shell format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG is based on the TIFF / EP format and is required to use Met@@ ad@@ ata . a hand@@ ful camera manufacturer D@@ NG is now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon .
this is probably one of the reasons why to replace the X@@ MP technology for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ ad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is an important label technology that allows users to enter your data into a file itself . the file information are stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; saved the XML / R@@ DF file .
many photograph@@ ers draw it before an original size of your recording , mostly in the raw format , it can be archi@@ ved from the image file . however , however , it can be used separately from the link between the met@@ ad@@ at@@ end@@ at@@ ei and the image file and as above mentioned , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ ad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization that support itself for fully compatible online met@@ ad@@ at@@ boards , which support a wide range of application areas and modelling , discussions and collective work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and expl@@ aining efforts to achieve a widespread acceptance of met@@ ad@@ at@@ boards and practices .
import images of the camera , the card reader or scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera line , you can use it as temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your shell archive . this function is not implemented yet .
for a fine @-@ layer processing you can use external programs . if you have the pictures again with &amp; digi@@ plug ; edit , then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata again . these were cut under circumstances from other programs .
protect the processed images for the copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export you only in Web@@ gal@@ eries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc .
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos into &amp; digi@@ plug ; in the section of adding photos you can have already on your hard drive , but the camera interface will provide you many advanced settings for impor@@ ting images to your Alb@@ end@@ aten@@ bank .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; connect these to the computer to switch off the camera to the display mode and switch them . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , they try to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a pig@@ mented indicator will be displayed on the camera . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ame and a symbol for file mapping will be displayed on the camera , photos , movies , music , etc .
before you can download the photos on your computer , you may need to install the camera information on each entry . with the page aff@@ ord characteristics and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface , you can see the characteristics of an entry or his met@@ ad@@ ata .
this dialog shows file properties and the photo information that can be saved from the camera . a symbol indicates that the picture has not been downloaded from your computer . please note that some digital cameras do not have any information available .
the rider Met@@ ad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer remarks , GPS , etc . this information is the same as the met@@ ad@@ ata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ plug ; or the image processing . note that these met@@ ad@@ ata are not available at some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer , is the click on the button to download and then download the photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ plug ; if the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures have been downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the desired cards selected by &amp; k@@ de ; if you choose the photos selected , use the button to download and then selected selected . download the button as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option is available for download . these pictures have been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ plug ; download the new pictures featuring a star in advance window . if you choose this option , only the new pictures are downloaded .
if you are using the buttons all download or selected , a dialog appears where you can select the target album , displayed in which the photos are listed below . the list of existing albums can be shown in section my albums . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after you select the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ plug ; the photos of the camera invites you to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos you can delete this from the camera . you can delete all of them to delete all . if you want to delete all , you need to delete this first and delete it later .
please note that there are no possibility to recover from the camera . you should not check if the photos are successful in a &amp; digi@@ plug ; it should be carefully deleted if you want to er@@ ase them from the camera . if you want to delete it from the camera , you should make it much faster than the camera &apos;s camera .
cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ame for the photos often not particularly meaning@@ ful names . this can be automatically deleted after the photos from the camera . this can be meaning@@ ful , the date and the time that the image has been taken to integrate into the fil@@ en@@ ames .
in the next section you will find options for turning and mirrors of the image and for file @-@ based under@@ side . if you use this latter option , you will automatically create a folder per day .
the options during the transfer will open three more options before the photos are stored on the record . if you select this , the respective entries are copied from the EX@@ IF fields in the IP@@ TC fields . with the latest option you can correct the date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures .
if you wish to use another type format as the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % - % d % H : % M : % S . turn the option date &amp; time . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time .
if you use the camera fil@@ en@@ ame option , you have the option to change the file names in lower@@ case . or in case letters if you prefer .
the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ plug ; used for a photo , will be displayed below the name , which is displayed in preview . your settings are stored and automatically used if you can open the camera windows .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to be used to implement a automatic rotation during shut@@ down . not all cameras do this information . in the section side@@ bar met@@ ad@@ ata , you can also read more details about the information that your camera is embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is normally switched on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t deliver &amp; digi@@ plug ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to switch the automatic rotation , use the button Extended and select the automatic rotation within the lower range of the window .
if your camera has been made information about the date , at which the photo is made , can be used &amp; digi@@ plug . all images with the same date are based on the same sub@@ album . not all cameras are available in the same sub@@ album . not all cameras can be viewed in the same sub@@ album . in the section side@@ bar Meta Data you can read what informations could be embedded into the photos .
this option is normally switched off , and in this case stores &amp; digi@@ plug ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , use the button Extended and select the option @-@ based sub@@ al@@ ben at the bottom end of the window .
the easiest way to download photos from their computer to your camera is so download . select the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; in which you can select the files that should be up@@ loaded instantly . you can also choose more than a file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the picture selection is , asks &amp; digi@@ plug ; you , where the images will be high . select the desired folder for the camera . select here the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the images are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Positi@@ oning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this is a position which can be displayed in long@@ itude and lat@@ itude , which can be displayed on a map . the data can be performed from the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system .
not only for professional photograph@@ ers , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise ge@@ ographic place . not everyone uses a plane to create an area through automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plann@@ er , military , police , architecture office and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you forgot later , where exactly the photo was done you can open a browser that shows the area . if you want to locate a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ plug ; user would like to locate to loc@@ alize the place of photos , it is good to record the position data of a photos .
the question is how to get the GPS data in the picture ? first you should know that ex@@ i@@ v2 supports many GPS data areas , such as the data in these fields ? there are at least three ways to reach this . directly with the right hardware , via a re@@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module to the ge@@ ographic assignment ( manual ) and last about the manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has a GPS unit . but there is a few to work with GPS recipi@@ ents . either as a map module or via transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ p@@ sb@@ abel . you need to save these data in GP@@ X format , as this is the only format that is supported by the ge@@ ographic assignment .
there are various programmes for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ related data from images and from GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; lin@@ ux : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the length of length and lat@@ itude or other data , you can use this script using the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Harv@@ ey . it uses the sign@@ alling coordinates to be created e.g. by m@@ ap@@ s.@@ google .
m@@ ap@@ s.@@ google@@ .com shows no European road maps . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; tries to change over his work processes as possible . there are many settings to access the behaviour of &amp; digi@@ plug . in order to change this settings , you must select between these settings . you can change between these changes by clicking on the symbols of the left side .
please select this application can be displayed on embedded preview or picture processing . you need to set the standard behavior of &amp; digi@@ plug ; fixed , when you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the Stand@@ ar@@ did@@ acy and legal data . these data will automatically be selected automatically in the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields . this data is also written in the IP@@ TC fields .
Aut@@ ort@@ itel is a syn@@ onymous with authors : this field should contain the professional name of the photographer . these can be used as a photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer or independent , commercial photographer , must be filled with this also .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo . this must not be the author , if this is a photo agency , such as Reuters or Associated Press ; if the picture is a storage photo , then the group or agency the picture is available here .
the IP@@ TC actions save the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC rims . this means that the met@@ ad@@ ata is permanently contained in the picture and is not only available in the database of &amp; digi@@ plug ; these met@@ ad@@ ata are also available and can be imported in &amp; digi@@ plug ; imported without losing .
image descriptions in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments using your photos to add to your photos , which are contained in pictures of the pictures . attention : in pictures which are already written assign@@ ments , these are over@@ written by the pictures of &amp; digi@@ plug .
the page Settings contains all options for the information that appear when the mouse poin@@ ter in the main window over a file . according to the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ plug ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to determine which file types &amp; digi@@ plug was found ; lets you add the file extension of this list and remove any file in one &amp; digi@@ plug ; Alb@@ um@@ folder , which has not been igno@@ red by &amp; digi@@ plug ; igno@@ red .
the default settings can be reset back by pressing the button on the right from each category .
the settings of the lumin@@ ance of &amp; digi@@ plug ; can be set on this page on the default values . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the entire image size lad@@ en@@ quot ; if you have one , then you can obtain better visibility results .
by default , the image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can switch this here . you can switch the tool@@ bar if you use the image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ and exposed areas of a picture can be marked with dark or brigh@@ ter color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in the image processing this picture can be switched on with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 and switched off .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance as in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia on this explanation .
with setting PNG compression you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality , since PNG requires any loss algorithm . if you have a quick computer , you can set this value to high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression .
with the TIFF option , you can comp@@ ress the De@@ fl@@ ate compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it does not have any influence on the image quality as the De@@ fl@@ ate algorithm uses loss .
with the setting @-@ free JPEG 2000 files you can save your loss . even if you were able to save the loss setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than at normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , met@@ ad@@ ata was not yet supported , but was in planning .
in the earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ plug ; the image processing was just a picture viewer for photos . currently , it has been developed very quickly to man@@ ipulation of your photos . with this dialogue you can change the settings of image processing .
the default content is that all green pixels are equal to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels at od@@ d lines , this difference is a bit soft , elim@@ in@@ ates the picture with a minimum loss of details . this option shows the picture a bit soft , elim@@ in@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 G@@ itter@@ patterns with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
when this option is set , the white @-@ off of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white is not reset . default is it a fixed color balance which was photograph@@ ed on a white card which was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . the use of the second sensors has the effect that exposed to exposed images in four steps more details in the peak lights . for other cameras this option will be igno@@ red .
the standard is the top , so the parts of your images should be embedded in the settings , because of the in@@ ability of your camera . using some unusual results since it shows the peak beam in various ros@@ es . most recently , you can try some parts of the missing information from the top lights .
this is possible because blue pixels in general is not as fast as green and red . &amp; d@@ c@@ w are therefore trying to re@@ construct the missing green and red propor@@ tions from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question , how much color or white you want .
if you select the option , you will get the option to set a level . here &apos;s a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted individually for each image .
set the L@@ umin@@ ant value after your taste . you must probably set it somewhat higher than the standard 1 . this can also be done later in the image options of &amp; digi@@ plug ; -@@ image processing are made . in order to hold time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ eval small , you should be con@@ serv@@ atively .
a demo process is a digital image process to obtain a complete image from the particle measurement data , which provides many cameras and the matrix color pixels is available . this algorithm is also known as an CFA @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; and D@@ c@@ w provide you three alternatives to your disposal : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ e@@ ity ) . after some tests it was produced such as A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ esis ) . however , this creates color order to the edges . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with acceptable result .
if you know the color sof@@ tening of your lenses , you can place the rotor and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction , as you are carried out during the shell conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions like this again . there are also LC@@ MS and &amp; digi@@ plug ; information like the color information from a color space in the others are as accurate as possible .
behavior Ask if a painting is opened in image processing / colour management module with shell files .
for example , click here the file , such as / usr / share / Color / ICC or / home / Color / ICC , in which you store all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ plug ; this file exam@@ ines during the start .
settings of the ICC Profile you have the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be paid . everything can be changed when opening the shell file later .
the screen saver view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Arg@@ y@@ ll . here only your pictures are not managed on the entire screen .
the input profiles should be able to fit the camera manufacturer and model you can fit . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain d@@ ton@@ ers or gam@@ ma@@ correction . currently , d@@ c@@ w Gamma is not corrected for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to perform the color mapping itself .
there are other options such as the Soft Pro@@ of @-@ Profile , which you can em@@ ulate the picture from one device . this is very useful before you can print a smaller colour range than your camera and some colors are so very saturated . this could be manually correct , rather than to rely on the blind algorithm .
for most cameras , it is quite obviously what colour profile is planned for them . unfortunately , not in the models of Canon . unfortunately , here is a table of cameras and profiles together . this answer is naturally un@@ official :
the Canon profile expansion leaves the style for the destination : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for Por@@ tra@@ it@@ und S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plug@@ in interface . it is an interface that is supported by a series of &amp; k@@ de ; image capture and image processing ; many modules support which were written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . choose which you want to use and these are loaded by &amp; digi@@ plug ; these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main square and beyond that you can also find some examples in the context menu of the presentation .
short commands for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands .
more information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found via the K@@ IP@@ I project via ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ ip@@ i @-@ plug@@ g@@ .org or in the hand@@ books of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the Di@@ asch@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper knob is adjusted between the images , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other applications switches off the met@@ ad@@ ata or off which are embedded in the lower end of the pictures during the display .
the camera properties show on the left side a list of all supported cameras . on the right side there is a button Automatic detection , which is trying to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . below are the port settings . currently , serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage are supported .
at the bottom end , you can set the path for USB@@ - and Fire@@ wire ( IEEE @-@ 1394 or i @-@ Link ) . this field is only active if you have a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / Camera or / m@@ nt /
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you must connect the camera to your computer , and switch to the display mode and turn off .
try out if &amp; digi@@ plug ; the camera will automatically detect the camera . if not , you can set camera @-@ od@@ ell and port manually , after you set up your camera , your camera will appear in the menu camera .
you can select any description for your camera . it will be displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can view all here .
with the option notification dialog for the move of &gt; Pictures in the tr@@ ash@@ can , you can set the conversation of &amp; digi@@ plug ; for extin@@ ction of a photos in a album . in sections of a photos and del@@ eting a album you will find further details .
editorial changes due to the right side bar can be tac@@ itly regulated by &amp; digi@@ plug ; if you use the changes in the right side bar without feedback . otherwise , you must use the changes with the button changes .
you can also retri@@ eve the screen of the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ plug ; in order to start the starting point , this will accelerate the start process of &amp; digi@@ plug ; .
setting up the new photos seek after new photos seek &amp; digi@@ plug ; the base folder was deleted after new or deleted albums ; if something out of the base folder , asks &amp; digi@@ plug ; it is if it should be able to delete it from the database .
different color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; digi@@ plug ; used to adjust the main window to your taste . this settings can choose from the tool@@ bar . a preview of available designs will be listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in interested , you will find a new design for &amp; digi@@ plug ; find further information about this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use these to view your photos and to improve your photos and improve image processing through a click with the left mouse button to preview of a picture or through the context menu of preview and selection of the entry advertisement / editing .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of these are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ plug ; for example , you are not part of your distribution . more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules are available in the image processing .
a status parts at the bottom edge of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current data number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top edge and including the tool bar for fast access to the most common functions .
the processing functions of image processing cap@@ tures your photos . however , no of functions will change the original photo , before you can use Save or the button Save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo , as soon as you have stored the picture .
so you should add a copy of your image before you change it . you can Save the Save as a file .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can re@@ produce the original image by creating the image processing of the image processing in the tool@@ bar . you will then lose any change you have been carried out at the photo since the last saving .
almost any action of image processing can be back or re @-@ manufactured . the last action can make you back , by processing your work back or re @-@ produced by select Edit menu from the menu .
if you often use it , you should make the key short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z to re@@ boot and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift Z to restore .
if you choose the &amp; L@@ MB ; check back button in the tool@@ bar a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions are made between also back and re @-@ manufactured .
once you have started the image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , picture , or the entries in the menu file , you will be asked if you want to save these .
you can also get in the photo and zo@@ oming in which you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; Maus@@ rad , or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the insured menu .
to custom@@ ize a picture to the window size you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : choose the magni@@ fication factor
view Full Screen mode shows the picture in full screen mode . if you do not want to use the tool@@ bar . if you do not want to change this in the installation dialog of &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can also call this in the installation dialog of &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can see this from the &amp; digi@@ plug ; see the section to set the image processing .
if you want to print the current image , you can select a picture in the menu file and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual pictures or whole phr@@ ases . all of the images can choose from your selection . you only need to select the images with the default methods and select from the menu album expor@@ ting print assistant . if you follow the assistant , you only need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides important information and promotions for selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation components , even in image processing . it will be displayed if one of the five riders is clicked on :
multiple Click on the same tab , the side@@ bar will disappear or disappear in the edge .
in the labelling view , you can enter labels with unlimited size or add . note that the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed to be used in the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields that you can use other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are truncated to 2000 characters and special characters are changed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should notice that limitations .
after you commented on , you can either use the button and switch to the next image , the labelling are saved then .
in addition to the user button there is a button More . with this you can read more met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or database . however , you can also choose the met@@ ad@@ ata to the files . however , this will always be done if you have a met@@ ad@@ ata setting , which will always be written into the pictures .
the section assessment shows an evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sor@@ ting . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the scanning short@@ cut of C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . in order to evaluate multiple pictures simultaneously , select this from and use the context menu .
the rating is written into the IP@@ TC field . the coding follows the scheme in the following table :
the key@@ word view shows a search box for fil@@ tering the key@@ word , the key@@ word tree and a selection box with the previously mentioned in this &amp; digi@@ plug ; -@@ Session c@@ anned .
the key@@ word tree is dynam@@ ically adapted to the entered search word . you can quickly restri@@ ct the number of possibilities in search for a key@@ word . this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is a further relief on the input of sample files at a picture series . if you have entered different words , these are stored for fast access .
pass@@ words can also be set through check boxes in the tree . all tags of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
if several pictures are selected in the main view and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word tree , this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection , if you want a selection with a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word filter section .
the side bar key@@ word filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar will be used with their album , - data , key@@ word and view@@ points . if in addition , one or more key@@ word filter will be used from the right side , only the cut quantity of these two are displayed . all words created are available .
you can also drag tags and lay down . if the key@@ word exists , you can simply drag them from the right side bar and put it on the selection . then a dialog when you ask if you want to set up the key@@ word .
in the upper example , the main window displays the pictures on one calendar day . the key@@ word filter is found on no words which reduces the quantity to three images . they were drawn with C@@ tr@@ l + a , and then a key@@ word should be drawn from the right @-@ up tree to the selection and taken there . a dialog asks whether this key@@ word should be set .
this search for changes will be held at any start of the program . you can also be switched on different settings .
if you have a rule with and created and determine that it would have one or be , you can easily change this with a double @-@ click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry in which the database is sought . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , which is already in the database .
for example , you can define an Extended search for all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group@@ ing options , you only need the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button in the button . see the options as follows :

this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have mainly adapted to &amp; digi@@ plug ; s concrete was adapted .
the reason why you have a color @-@ administered workflow is that the colors come from your camera or scanner , you can achieve a predic@@ table deviation from your camera or scanner . with a colored workflow you can reach the colors on your monitor using your camera or scanner at the same and the colors they print or in the web , to which you can print out of your digital dark chamber .
if the topic is on color administration then you would like to press the buttons . unfortunately , color administration means that you inform you adequate information about color management at each point of image processing work@@ . in addition , links with deeper information allow you to make your own informative decisions to make you the desired result .
if your image work@@ ings meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t need to worry about color administration .
they are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the RGB colour space . ( see below )
your only other image expend@@ itures are by e @-@ mail or web , where s@@ RGB of the de @-@ fac@@ to standard is standard .
so if s@@ RGB does so good work and life for everyone so easy , why should I use another color space and make the thoughts about color spo@@ ilt ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colors which we really can see is shown below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors which we can see , the hu@@ fe@@ is@@ en@@ ular region , and the colours in the RGB color space , the tri@@ angular area .
if you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger farms , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms , and then click on info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to meet my monitor when I decided to work only in the RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you work in the RGB colour space or not , you need to keep your monitor k@@ alli@@ bri@@ mm@@ . so , if you are working as a color space of s@@ RGB , you need to use either your monitor on the RGB standard k@@ alli@@ bri@@ eren , a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions to improve one picture in most cases . use it before you try to pass a further manual processing .
the functions norm@@ alize , ab@@ stain@@ ed , Automatic and contrast expand from the menu . automatically correc@@ ting your colors the best . they will have to experiment with these effects , to see what works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled up the entire picture , so that the dar@@ k@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test point as bright as possible , without changing its colour cas@@ ings . this function is often a stomach correction for images that are dark or balanced .
equivalent : this method adjust@@ s the lumin@@ osity factor of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity is as flat as possible . sometimes , the same very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only gar@@ bage . it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracles by a picture or destroyed it .
automatic ab@@ normal@@ ities : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright border ones and adjusted the rotor , green and blue channels at the complete hist@@ o@@ gram@@ mar .
contrast extend : this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the RGB values of an image through the one of the lowest and highest values on the maximum possible range and a new ji@@ ust@@ ing of all values . this is only visible with balanced pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ plug is a semi @-@ automated tool to perform the white balance of a photos .
the white @-@ equal correction is slightly limited since a colour space is done with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you are able to perform the white compensation in the raw mode , which is working in 16 @-@ bit mode , so your possibilities for correction are better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm of protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . they start it with the menu entry colors white as the image processing .
the preview window can be adapted in size . on the left you can see both the original image as well as the preview of the target image . the preview will be dynam@@ ically adapted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original wh@@ it@@ ish , it is enough to view the window .
the preview photos shows a red mark@@ er . the L@@ umin@@ ance of the Pix@@ els under this mark@@ er is displayed as vertical line in hist@@ ogram .
on the right , a hist@@ ogram appears that dynam@@ ically changed , as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , most Pixel very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can choose whether one of the three colors or your sum will appear . the sum will be called l@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , saturation and Gamma . the sh@@ adows is adjustable you can improve the shadow details of your photos or also down .
an@@ stat with the above controls performed , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then use anywhere to use the color temperature for calcul@@ ating the colour temperature of white . on this type , the temperature and green values are automatically set .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of default settings . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposed level dict@@ ator increases the colors when more than a color channel of Pix@@ els are over@@ exposed . this is shown in preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons Save as and shop do exactly this . each setting of the white balance you have set you can store this in a text file and later re@@ load .
the button pre@@ ferences will return all filter values again on their standard values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that also neutral settings will result in another photo as your original . if you save that , your original image will be changed .
you can adjust the coefficients per color channel of the mach@@ ined image . 8 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high quality images . however , this coding needs even more disk space , calcul@@ ating time and is only available for the formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialogue as the processing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color pro@@ filed . color @-@ mapping can be performed through the sub@@ window for the usage of color pro@@ filing allows you to rate the chapter of color administration .
another important tool is available in the menu below colors . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust and allows you to use these for multiple photos . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner will always make the same errors and you always need the same correction . in the manual you will find further information .
a very powerful possibility of exposure problems to correct is the tool for gra@@ dation , that you can find under colors Gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tools Far@@ be@@ ff@@ ective sets you four farms , a solar effect effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and an edge filters .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , a effect that emerged when they were partially inver@@ ted with a short light . the result was a partial neg@@ atively of the image . the result was a partial neg@@ atively of the picture . this tool allows you to fine this interesting effect .
the intensity controls the solar panel . at approx . 50 % intensity the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase is finally a negative image that is not possible to generate photo paper .
this is an example of the solar effect . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it diff@@ ers from a saturation , that he makes a stronger contrast effect that makes the colours brilliant and brilliant . try it simply , it emb@@ ell@@ ished many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an optimized color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thereby a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ vet . Vel@@ vet . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated colors are also some phot@@ ograph@@ s , especially those who are hardly landscapes to do .
the Ne@@ on@@ filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on@@ light on the contra@@ sts . the parameter level controls the brightness of the results and the sli@@ der repet@@ itions the strength of the Ne@@ on@@ lich@@ ts . at large images the filter can be extended the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not un@@ usually that you want to change the color contrast of your photos with the tools in the menu below colors . once you are satisfied with the result . once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you make a photo of bad light conditions you can get the reverse problem . even in this case , the tool for brightness / saturation guarantee a good choice for brightness instead of increasing them . all changes you can see in preview . if the result you can do the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool Gra@@ dation and the simple Leu@@ ch@@ ase / contrast / Gamma is the tool sound correction to improve the exposure . even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated , you will need only the range of slides for this tool . specifically , the three sli@@ der below the hist@@ o@@ date .
the window contains an indication of the intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active can@@ als or the selected area . under the graph , three sli@@ der can be clicked on the picture to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn operation is to move the knob and move on it as the image changes .
on the right side , the original and preview of the picture can be viewed . the preview will be dynamic , based on the settings of the image , updated . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be set if the hist@@ ogram is dominated by a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic y axis . in pictures the large areas of a constant color is dominated by a single pillar . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic classification is useful .
three controllers : the top for dark tones , the middle for bright tones , and the bottom for the middle tones , often called Gam@@ ma@@ values .
the three color pin pet@@ tes can be used in preview of the original image to adjust the input values of the shade , medium and bright tones automatically . furthermore , there is a button for a fully automatic alignment .
output values : the output values allow the selection values for each area . there are also two regul@@ ators that can be used to change the output values e.g. in the input values . the compression of the output values can be used as a background , while something different in the fore@@ ground is to be used .
automatically : this knob will automatically set the images automatically depending on the image values of the image .
save and load : with these buttons , the set values can be saved in the file system and later re@@ charged . in addition , Gim@@ p levels format is used .
if you are using this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette , the input values will be automatically adjusted for all sh@@ adows , medium and solar sounds . activate the color p@@ ette to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
this option provides over@@ exposed pixels , to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect on the preview only and it &apos;s not a effect on the final result .
below is an example of the adjustment of input values to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture ( 2 ) .
on the left side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed dynamic , depending on your settings . on the right side the following options are available :
modification channel : this selection box allows the channel to be changed from the module :
in addition to this box , there are two symbols to change between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for images that were recorded with a digital camera , linear mode produces a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps .
for example , if you move a short valves to the right , for example , bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones are correspon@@ dent and the corresponding picture pixel are dar@@ ker .
on the preview of the original photos is a red mark . if you want to change this marking on the curve , the right curve is displayed on the curve , which is the original value . create a point on this line and move it on and off until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save and load : with these buttons , you can do exactly this . every curve you can create this file system and later re@@ loaded in the file system and later the file format is Gim@@ p cur@@ sor format .
if you are using this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the sh@@ atten@@ s , medium and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette which you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ esc@@ ence curve .
the option over@@ exposed over@@ exposed pixels will be found to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result . this is an indicator that is only shown in preview and it &apos;s not a effect on the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ white photo that was corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . sh@@ adows and sun sound was used with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing is a tool to improve the colour channels or change the shades of the photos .
the Channel Mixer is another highly developed tool to mix colour shades of pictures . you can edit it from the menu color mixer of the image processing .
with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first note how to correct the channels by taking the relative distribution and impact . the left area of the window shows you a preview of . the original can be viewed with the own riders .
the preview of the target image has a red markers . if you are positioned in picture below , a vertical line appears in hist@@ ogram to display the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are on the right below : knob for red , green and construction allow you to change these channels . if you want to activate the respective color component , this is especially convenient , when the Channel Mixer is using DAS tool for creating great black @-@ white conver@@ sions from your photos . try the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially if you can mix mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color comes to a visible noise that comes from colour@@ less . colour@@ less consists of small cra@@ y@@ ons to appear in each channel . if that is the case you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rome conversion in which you need to reduce the colour@@ less first .
the Save as and load buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any mixer setting can be saved for later and then load . that used file format is the Gim@@ p @-@ mixer format .
this option provides over@@ exposed pixels , to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect on the preview only and it &apos;s not a effect on the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was re @-@ adjusted . the original image is enabled ( 1 ) and the picture was shown below ( 2 ) .
black / White @-@ photography was always fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white a work step , as colour images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film roller profiles .

using &amp; digi@@ plug ; mould texture can apply decorative tex@@ tures on a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless whether it is a color image or not , you can look like an oil painting on a screen , the Sti@@ ch of an old master , a pop kind of portrait of enlarged points or like a wall picture on a wall . the menu entry of the image processing can be used for this .
relief : post@@ p@@ one this parameter increases to the right or three dimensional stability of the texture on the picture .
a paper text surface is applied on the photo below . the original photo is ( 1 ) and the modified ( 2 ) . the relief parameter was placed on 200 .
a decorative frame can be added with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool frame can be added to an image .
the eye of an observation to keep the limits of a photos is no easy task . a possibility to maintain a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to the scattered eye . under the frame the module can be started under image processing .
type : with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image . we move it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ white pictures ) , k@@ ant@@ et se@@ det it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame of the ideal solution for a button@@ hole and decor@@ atively adds a decorative frame with pattern .
width : the width of the frame is in percent . the range for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
this will be bigger than the original , but the original aspect ratio is greater than the original but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool After aspect ratio .
with this practical tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text in any picture at any spot . this also goes to several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply use the text and place it with the mouse . using the text , the larger must be the character set . at the end , simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . already the picture is finished .
each setting which you have chosen for your text can be changed until you want to push the button &quot; OK &quot; after the image has been saved once , the text is part of the picture . it can &apos;t be changed anymore .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool sten@@ cil apply to create a sten@@ cil on a picture .
the menu image template in image processing can be used to place templates over a picture .
for the sten@@ cil , there are no restrictions about the size and orientation . you need to add the PNG file size . if you want to add your sten@@ cil template . you simply send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ plug ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ plug @-@ Users @ k@@ de.@@ org ..
if you use this tool for first time , you have to put your sten@@ cil with the button Base folder in the dialog . select the folder where you have to copy the sten@@ cil files . these settings will be noticed for the next start .
after the root folder for templates , a building view appears , which reflects the file structure of the sten@@ cil template . the selection of a folder is updated automatically .
you can find three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
Enlarge : this knob increases the next image . it is cent@@ ered around the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shr@@ inking : this button resi@@ zed the picture below . it is cent@@ ered around the mouse . if you want to use the template on the entire image , you have to shr@@ ink the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
post@@ p@@ one : use this button to move the picture below the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK when you want to use the sten@@ cil on your image . the image will then be adapted to automatically .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; presents three different tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of you have advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but produces especially in dark areas , gra@@ ined pictures .
shar@@ p@@ ness mask works on the contrast of the edges to a picture shar@@ p@@ ate . actually , it doesn &apos;t work to remove atmospheric Dun@@ st and makes it a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by copyright protected by Win@@ ston Chang .
it is probably the best of the three because he really improved the shar@@ p@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its use and has different parameters to adapt .
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ alised images need a correction of shar@@ p@@ ness . this again leads to a common colour . this is that sharp edges are printed . the same phenomenon can usually be printed on paper . SLR cameras do usually need more subsequently shar@@ pen@@ ing than normal cameras for the private user .
at JPEG pictures , a camera is often applied to internal shar@@ pen@@ ing . images in the raw format is always necessary during processing .
some scanner apply a shar@@ pen@@ ing filter already during the reading of the image . when you dis@@ able this de@@ activate the control over your image .
in some situations you can obtain usable results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing device . you can correct shar@@ pen@@ ing the menu entry .
however , they should be careful if the results are not very naturally result : the shar@@ pen@@ ness increase the edge of the edges , but also ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , the usable technique is shar@@ ply to correct . in general , you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to correct but shar@@ pen it is much easier than it &apos;s shar@@ pen@@ ing . use the tool for sof@@ tening with the menu entry to the right side of the dialog box shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ sharp m@@ asked is a very good tool to remove the veil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original photo and preview can help edit the picture . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values do often generate good results and should try out first . an increase in the radius or amount ampli@@ fy the effect . if you make the shar@@ p@@ ness mask to strong , cra@@ yon and the impression of barbecue will produce near sharp edges .
the radius is how many pixels are affected on each side of an edge through the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . you should therefore shar@@ pen pictures at best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the ignor@@ ing picture one of the original is added . this makes the strength of the shar@@ p@@ ness .
the sw@@ elling value is a break from the maximum RGB value and the fixing difference . one can thus define a minimum difference to use the filter . this way , areas with a soft change between the pot@@ ters are exemp@@ t from shar@@ pen@@ ing from shar@@ pen@@ ing , and therefore beauti@@ fy errors in mind , heavens and water surface .
this is an example of un@@ coated filter . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the illustrated picture ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp m@@ asked was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a sw@@ elling value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool re@@ focus is focused on a picture due to improvement of the shar@@ p@@ ness . it used to be protected by the protected protected exhaust filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries an image to &amp; quot ; re@@ fo@@ res@@ sive quot ; in which it is using a technique called F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filtration . this is using a technique called F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese Fil@@ ing . it can usually reach better results as un@@ sharp . you can start from the menu by taking colors re@@ focal in the image processing .
in practice , the circular saw is much better than the G@@ auss &apos;s folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which is far away from the source pixel , which is far beyond the source pixel size . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese In@@ verse is affected by most cases even very strongly influenced by the remote pixels . that causes un@@ wanted results .
circular shar@@ p@@ ness : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for use of this module . for most images , the default value should be 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image should be very un@@ sharp , but then on can@@ y@@ ters .
correlation : a correlation of correlation can help reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation was reduced the shar@@ p@@ ness effect of the module .
cat@@ er@@ filter : an increase of the cat@@ er@@ ate filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values are higher than 0.1 only rarely helpful if the sound quality is too low , and eg ; 0 is the image quality very bad . a usable value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value will continue to prevent the image .
G@@ auss &apos;s shar@@ p@@ ness : this is the radius for the G@@ auss &apos;s shar@@ p@@ ness . do you use this parameter to avoid un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing filter . in most cases you should use this value to 0 to avoid anno@@ ying arti@@ facts . if you need a value equal to 0 , you may also increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
Mat@@ ri@@ zen@@ size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . however , an increase in the mat size can choose good results . however , note that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter . in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save as and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any re@@ focus parameter set you set for later and can be loaded afterwards .
try to perform any cutting , color and intensity fixes on the picture before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before changing the image elsewhere . the reason for this is that many sur@@ g@@ eries are not visible yet visible , but later left un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts .
if you want to read and comp@@ ress pictures , and eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp m@@ asked better results than shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could cause it to be bl@@ ur@@ red , use a larger neighborhood than shar@@ pen@@ ing .
theore@@ tically it must always be bl@@ ur@@ gently to produce arti@@ fact . even under optimal conditions it can never show the effect of un@@ shar@@ p@@ ic filters . practically , the result of the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese Fil@@ ters is always at least just as good as the infin@@ itely mask . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is often better than the machining of small details .
below you can see a comparison between different filters , on a small un@@ focused picture , see :
the original un@@ sharp color image has to be corrected . this image has been made with an analogue camera . the un@@ focused result is due to un@@ sufficient light for the Auto @-@ focus lens .
for more information about methods of shar@@ p@@ ness structure in digital images , you can consult a technical comparison in English under this address .
the knob glasses sets the im@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of the range which has been dark , to generate a more natural P@@ up@@ ille .
the paint tin@@ te allows a adapted color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set this here .
the tool error correction is one of the most developed tool to remove the desired arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the intra@@ ocular algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en , France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
this tool contains several pre@@ ferences as Star@@ points to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the rider smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
details p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of details . a small value leads to an even smooth curve over the picture . a value of 0.9 should be used for details because no shar@@ pen@@ ing should be subsequently needed . please note that the details will always be listed below .
angle depen@@ dency of alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value is smoo@@ ther evenly into all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film grain size or CCD noise will produce a high value of similar patterns . JPEG Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te will be removed best at a value in the vicinity of 1 .
&#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum setup factor above all . p then defines the relative glucose . therefore , use this value matching the degree of noise in your image .
rule : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects greater structures . the higher the value is set , the more will appreciate if it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 .
repet@@ itions : are on how often the algorithm will pass through . normally , 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angle focal length da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ y Alpha . if Alpha is selected , you should make sure that small angles can produce a long runtime . so you should choose this value so the greatest possible and un@@ acceptable for your needs .
integ@@ rative step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integ@@ rative step width in pixels . you should avoid the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never larger than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you will get through the choice of this option is low . it doubles but the running time . we recommend it to let him leave .
the buttons Save as and shop do exactly this . each setting of image error correction can be stored in a text file and later re@@ loaded .
image error correction is compar@@ atively very fast in work . however , it can still be very long and a high CPU load after moving . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button termination .
below you can see how to remove image error with Small Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ t . this module is used on a picture that was caused by a bad film@@ making during the journey failed . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and correct picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug is a very powerful tool to reduce image exchange . it uses a protected algorithm by Peter Heck@@ el .
this tool provides selectable image filters to remove st@@ ains and other arti@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sens@@ es from the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ ins ; remove effects from sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read this tutorial on English in this tutorial .
the screen photo above shows a typical scene which was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a grain noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you need only the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings can remain at the default settings .
radius controlled the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which requires the filters a pixels per pixel and can increase the image . by the radius the area is moving across the picture and the color in it is smoo@@ ther and thereby smaller errors .
shar@@ p@@ ness : controls the shar@@ p@@ ness of the filter . this value sets the pixel pitch after the front , if it is increased . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filters can no longer be received and smo@@ ked up . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filters can no longer receive and smo@@ kers down .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the shar@@ p@@ ness . if it is too strong , the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , the entire noise can be removed or noise @-@ tips . put it at a value close to the maximum , if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance of the image . we recommend to change either color or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . this settings will not affect the smoo@@ ther process by the details settings .
color : controls the color toler@@ ant of the image . we recommend to modify either color or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . this settings will not affect the smoo@@ ther process by the details settings .
gamma : controls the Gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dar@@ ker ranges which typically affects stronger , but also poll@@ uted the shadow areas .
damp@@ ing : controls the alignment of ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ damp@@ ing . this value defined as quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius on variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges will appear on the edges . if it &apos;s on a minimum , cra@@ dle and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter may occur . it can remove space and is the recommended method for it .
save and load : these buttons are used exactly to use . all parameters for the noise , which you have set , can be saved in the file system and later loaded .
this is an example to change how to change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected parameter was used with the default settings .
sometimes a picture to cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution , the image is a bit soft to shar@@ pen . use tool for sof@@ tening with the menu entry to correct and experim@@ enting with the plain . the preview window indicates the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ plug was ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo albums .
this filter to rest@@ or@@ ate you the opportunity to remove a lot of un@@ wanted arti@@ facts about your pictures . it is very good adapted to remove Gau@@ ß , original or subsequently digit@@ alised images . the smoo@@ thing takes place along the image con@@ tours and makes the content as it also makes the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for color and text application . the text box is performed using another tool , the error correction , developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ oses and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te reduce the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a deser@@ ted compression algorithm produces some compression &amp; quot ; - small standards can be correct in the un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the buttons Save as and shop do exactly this . each setting of photo rest@@ or@@ ration can hereby be saved in a text file and later re@@ loaded .
photo rest@@ or@@ ration is compar@@ atively very fast in the work . however , it can still be very long and a high CPU load after moving . you can therefore start the calculation at any time with the button .
below , you can reduce as a photo with Equ@@ al space . this module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the inf@@ am@@ ous film gra@@ dation on the voc@@ abul@@ ary . the original image is listed below ( 1 ) and correct under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example for the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures can be applied to an old colour photo that caused by a scanner . you can see the scan factory which was shown by the Sc@@ ann@@ er@@ illumination and photo paper . the original image is listed below ( 1 ) and the correct picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Tool Hot@@ pixels allows you to remove Hot@@ pixels from photos which have been removed with a CCD camera , eight were used to remove algorith@@ ms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i Project that are protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are especially a problem since many cameras with JPEG compression via a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixel quot ; on a photo with a dark @-@ picture sub@@ tract method . there are currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file into the assist@@ ants with the button dark screen . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixel . these are highlighted in the image review .
if you have an old digital camera it is important that you can record the dark screen directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the appropriate dark picture to the correct picture . an automatic processing of the dark screen will find the bad pixels . please note that the assistant invites the last dark picture and this automatically gets in the next session .
the image range and the preview will help you correct the result of the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all areas of view .
select an area to watch the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . choose the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ishing these pixel blocks . these are the available filter available :
thirst : there is an average of neighbor@@ hoods . the resulting color is assigned to all def@@ ective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a gap of 1 pixel pitch will be drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel rate are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which then uses to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the pixels in the block .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a gap of 3 or less are drawn to comp@@ ute a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cub@@ an curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photograph , made of a def@@ ective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fication correction is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. , lower corners , one image to correct .
wide angle lens , especially those in the medium and large photo format , often can not even reach the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; ( sh@@ ady ) it reaches the edges and edges of the picture by reducing the light to the sensor .
but he also has dis@@ advantages . many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter , which should be impossible to keep the camera with hand . wide angle lens should also use center filter , an aperture of f / 16 or smaller , since otherwise un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing effects will arise through movement .
with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s fil@@ ming and shades of digital cameras and film scanners , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter , which is used without this filter . the tool for Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fication correction is provided with a C@@ enter@@ filter on a picture . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
check the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fication correction filter with three control units and three more the exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light ampli@@ fication at the point of the greatest density the filter . the default density is 2.0 , or random@@ ly to compens@@ ate a luminous intensity of 2 , un@@ ri@@ verb@@ .@@ nar@@ rates to compens@@ ate a larger degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to compens@@ ate a small degree .
Leu@@ ch@@ intensity , contrast and gamma settings : the works of a picture with the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fication correction is reduced the lumin@@ osity of the target image with these options . regul@@ ators set only positive values as you have to increase the settings .
if you want to adjust the im@@ aging of the exposure of the target image , so let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ plug ; picture production from the menu color Gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fication correction to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the correct picture and counter@@ f@@ correction is also performed in the image with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Lin@@ sen@@ distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a protected algorithm by David Hod@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ rical distortion . color@@ less distor@@ tions can not be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree deals with the general geomet@@ ric distortion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar effect , but fl@@ ashing the edges . this correction is not used in the tool .
the coefficient of fourth grain is corrected the remote corners opposite to the second degree . if you can combine these two , each geomet@@ rical distortion is almost eliminated .
general : this value controls the strength of the distortion second degree . with negative values can be corrected and positive values k@@ is@@ sen@@ ic distortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the distortion part of the distortion . this value is stronger than changing the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; corners of the parameter set the parameter of the parameter .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and causes a correction of first gradient by . negative values improve during positive the picture .
brigh@@ ter : this value adjusted the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase .
to find you the best filter settings , illustr@@ ating the dialog with a preview of the distor@@ tions . the values for your image are stored and used as default values for your image .
the tonn@@ age or k@@ is@@ sen@@ ic correction should be carried out in front of all conc@@ ision or size changes . best result you perform this correction as all the first . if you have a painting and then perform an asymmet@@ rical correction would be the effect of wrong the wrong .
to help you can find the best correction to show you this tool a vertical and horizontal relief line . move it into an important place , such as the sea level or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines on this place . in connection , you can correct the tonn@@ age / k@@ is@@ sen@@ ic distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cr@@ ust @-@ shaped distortion is the resulting image of black corners . you can remove these with the cutting tool in the menu transform@@ ers@@ ing from the image processing or via the zoom knob of this dialog .
for most pictures the tonn@@ age correction is enough . the next logical step for some moti@@ fs like pictures from the front , frame and paintings are the perspective so correct to correct the angle in the picture 90 degrees . note that if you keep the camera with hand , you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example for the tonn@@ age correction to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate infrared film of G@@ vacc@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website , which is available under this URL . filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( TM ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left @-@ hand side of the window you can select the area for the preview . if you move the red rectangle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview you can adjust two parameters of film gra@@ zing and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the ISO regulator the amount of film gra@@ ins and the domin@@ ance of the color Green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in the conversion . green meadows are white as snow !
since the filter color channels are mis@@ used by infr@@ a @-@ red film , especially the green channel does not turn the effect on black / white photos as the color information are missing .
this is an example of Infr@@ ared cinem@@ as used on a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is listed below ( 1 ) and the image of the film has been set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a type A@@ ura in the peak lights .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter film@@ maker is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to re@@ produce film gra@@ zing on your images . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X , known to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturer of great silver grain of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film effect effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , road photo , gra@@ ce@@ ful view , especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ men photos , you need to use this filter .
with the regulator , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the gra@@ ins . the default value is even though higher values are needed , to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more gra@@ ins , you can use the filter several times .
this is an example of film strip effect on a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity correspond to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting . natural pictures and styles are good for this effect .
there are two controllers to influence this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the pin size between one and five . th@@ icker brush are better suited for large pictures . smoo@@ ther controls the plain or from the other side , the hin@@ ge .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the picture is marked with ( 2 ) . pin@@ ching size for this 640 pixels wide image is 1 and Smooth 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Filter coal drawing used color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a cab@@ bage in drawing , are therefore emphas@@ ized for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene would have chosen to sk@@ ate you . this would be good pictures to start making it .
there are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adjust the contrast .
this is an example of the carbon @-@ recording filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) and the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter engraving contains your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Filter engraving is a fast tool to return your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works especially well with a simple structure , in which colour is not the most important at the content . filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey , mon@@ arch landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , is equal to 10 % , the default settings .
this is an example of the engra@@ v@@ ant filter . the original ( 1 ) and the illustrated picture ( 2 ) . the depth used is 10 % .
this filter group allows you to transform a normal photo in an artwork with distortion effects . it uses a copyright protected algorith@@ ms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image in cells and makes it look like if it is considered by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog to the wave blocks 1 the image here is distor@@ ted with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can termin@@ ate this effects at any time with the button .
this filter group allows you to transform a normal photo in an artwork with visual acuity . it uses a copyright protected algorith@@ ms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ shar@@ p@@ ic : wi@@ pe the image along steep lines coming out from a center . this simul@@ ates the un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of a zo@@ omed camera and thereby creating a dynamic expression of often in sports photography .
radi@@ ale Un@@ shar@@ p@@ ic : wi@@ pe the picture by rotation of the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of a rotating camera .
distances : wi@@ pe the picture to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera se . the object seems back in the background .
motion shar@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : wi@@ pe the picture through horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the im@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing , camera .
sof@@ tening im@@ pulses : wi@@ pe the picture soft in the dark and strongly in the bright tones . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour photos or add a warm and sub@@ til@@ ed light .
push @-@ shar@@ shar@@ k : wi@@ pe the image through acci@@ dental shift of pixels and simul@@ ates the im@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of a arbitr@@ ary moving camera .
intelligent un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : finds the p@@ add@@ ling in the picture and wi@@ ped them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divide the photo in rectangular cells and then created it by filling with an average pixel rate .
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button .
the ra@@ iny drops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ iny drops onto your image . this gives a natural look for natural look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected algorithm .
dri@@ p size allows you to change the size of the dri@@ ps . because the dri@@ p size is not possible automatically with the size of the image , it is often necessary to reduce the size for small pictures . number of drops change to the optical effect of drops on the picture .
you can use the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing is free of reg@@ ression . use the range of tools to choose the area , e.g. a vision that should stay free . if you then start the filter tra@@ ys , the area will remain free of reg@@ ression .
this is an example of the rain@@ drops Fil@@ ters . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the illustrated picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the picture has the wrong orientation , you can bring it by mirrors or turning into the right orientation . you will find the tools in the menu transform@@ ations and transform@@ ating mirrors .
photo infl@@ ated is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality .
an image to shr@@ ink@@ age is simple . the big question is how you can find a picture when you reach the resolution ? how can you find the missing information ? how can you see the missing information ? how can you see the missing information ? how can you see the missing information ? how can you see the missing information here . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo is the wrong size you can change it to the desired size with the size of size . select the size change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog box is shown below .
the tool used to change the size of a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to enlarge the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality then try the tool to b@@ lown off .
many image processing programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. split inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ plug ; uses a further developed approach . the under@@ lying algorithm photo was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you must tell the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the rider Neue Size and are listed below :
keeping aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , when entering the new size , the aspect ratio will preserve the aspect ratio of the original image .
rule : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects greater structures . the higher the value is set , the more will appreciate if it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 .
the buttons Save as and store are used exactly . each insert for photo can be saved as text file and later re@@ loaded .
photo infl@@ ated is very fast with what it makes , but it can still be very long and a high CPU load after moving . you can break the calculation at any time with the button .
you can see below an example for photo shooting , enlarged by a small color image to the double size . the original ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard enlargement to comparison .
the cutting of a photos is not just a frequently performed surgery , but also a often under@@ estimated tool to create a picture with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and pull out the rectangle , then you will see this rectangle that move your mouse .
when you start the mouse button , you will be cut off the area of the photos . therefore , you can change a good overview how your photo would look after cutting , by clicking on the corners of the rectangle , creating a new rectangle that simply drag along with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cutting button , use the button Con@@ cutting button in the tool@@ bar and the photo is tail@@ ored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries to Save or file Save as in the menu file to save the newly designed photo .
in the courts , you can change the size of the rectangle by post@@ p@@ one the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog .
in the tool for aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in high @-@ format , the larger value of the height and in the width of the width is assigned .
the tool According to page ratio uses an important aspect ratio . this means that it is always equal , regardless of whether you use centimeters , In@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of dialogue there are two buttons to adjust the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or vertically .
below the dialog you can use the Max . relationship button to cut the maximum possible , depending on the selected relationship and orientation , set .
the tool According to page aspect saves the settings depending on image orientation ( Horizontal or Ver@@ tical ) . if you are stored the access tool to the next time , this settings are displayed in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data is reflected and not the original image .
the compositions of the compositions enable help to create and put your pictures better . these are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic sub@@ missions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third party , harmon@@ ic triangles have an opportunity to have a rectangle in similar harmon@@ ic triangles to the diagonal .
golden middle : the golden middle is a split which is in different natural growth pattern , such as the spiral of a Naut@@ ilus shell or the bl@@ ossom leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all possible things that we find as beautiful .
the golden pitch is the error number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used to build your temple and pyr@@ am@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you have your images , buildings and even photos , to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty .
the number is from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . , where each number is equal to 1 equals 1 : 1.6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition of this rule is considered visual harmon@@ ious .
the golden middle represents more li@@ que@@ er supplies available if you have an image . these are listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ al will bring you good results for your photos . compared to third party con@@ es , the golden spiral is a liquid line that can follow the eye through the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow .
a further rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called the golden spiral . it should be something that the eye can turn in the center of the composition . that can be a line with or different objects . this thing can be just there without the eye , it will carry out its task .
the golden triangles is also separated from the above @-@ discussed golden spiral . please note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , golden triangles are no equ@@ alled triangles . diagonal to pl@@ az@@ ing these lines can be viewed as a static object .
if you are using golden triangles around your frame , you will create a effect of professional phot@@ ograph dynamic Sym@@ met@@ ry . try your image focus on one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can &apos;t reach anywhere else .
the options horizont@@ ally mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic sub@@ missions .
with the button Color , you can set the colour of the auxiliary lines . if you have a painting with many colors and a high contrast , the help lines can be invisible . on this type you can adjust the colour of the lines your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture at any angle .
if you make a photo , then it happens to fix the camera . this creates a picture where the things turned around an angle . you can manually repair this with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing and the tool free rotation . choose this transform@@ ating free rotation and adjust the target angle .
turn your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are given in degrees . with the button pres@@ ets you can reset the sli@@ der again to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture will be shown above .
for your help , the module includes a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter to the two lines . after you move it over an important point of the picture , you can aff@@ ix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you have shot a picture you will find un@@ wanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a possibility to repair this is the function transform@@ ers@@ ing from the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the picture is easy to cut the function . select one of the following options :
the option of anti @-@ ali@@ asing gl@@ utt@@ eth the picture a bit after the rotation . however , please note the above warning .
all per@@ spectral transform@@ ations are performed to a fixation of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to view the red squares in the corners of your image . the preview will then automatically be calculated automatically . on the right side of the dialog box you will find some information which will help you change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas which are created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas which are created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle left above : shows the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed zone .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees on the upper right corner of the transformed zone .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed zone .
right bottom : shows the current angle in degrees on the lower right corner of the transformed zone .
after adjusting the perspective , the image is somewhat poll@@ uted . for individual adjustment , this effect is small , but two adjustments generate twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after completing the perspective , you get un@@ pleasant tri@@ angular holes in the corners . an option to refer to this is the picture with transform@@ ers@@ ing cut out of the image processing .
the tool used is used to move a part of the image to the right and move the other part in the opposite direction . this is no rotation , the picture is distor@@ ted . with other words , a rectangle is transformed into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module via transform@@ ers@@ .
check your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical corners . you can press horizont@@ ally and vertically at the same time . if you want to push the angle , the angle will be displayed on zero . a preview of the effectiveness will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown on the right .
at your help , a vertical and horizontal line are integrated . move your mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image .
after you have carried out the signature , the image will usually be wi@@ ped . for a single level , this effect is usually neg@@ le@@ gible , but two cas@@ ings generate twice as much as wi@@ ping and therefore you should avoid this .
after crossing the image has un@@ beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a possibility to remove this is the image with transform@@ ers@@ ing cut out of the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write files from your system and , in some cases , from the type such as these libraries are comp@@ il@@ ated . in most distri@@ butions you will process a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ ous cases .
because of these libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all available file formats on this site . however , they will always be JPEG and TIFF among them .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; displays only files in formats to know . this is done by the file extension and a comparison of these with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list . you can change this list of file extension &amp; digi@@ plug ; in section configuration you will find further information .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to choose to select the format . a detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ plug ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression techniques to digital images . thereby redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data on a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also be saved , if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw format format , you can read from Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can find detailed information about the usage of modules with &amp; digi@@ plug . in the section configuration you will find further information on the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ plug .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; supports the loading of raw images only with the program d@@ c@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ plug ; all support cameras can be seen below on the web site of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw material data from &amp; digi@@ plug ; supported :
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often saved in the Avi@@ - or MPEG format ; but if you click on a movie file and has no installed possibilities for movies . &amp; digi@@ plug ; if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ plug ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playback of movies use the program to play back .
go forward to the previously visited album in the chron@@ icle . you can only go forward if you went back before .

all configured cameras are listed here . you can use the entry camera to add a new camera to the list . please check in the following camera according to further information .
K@@ IP@@ I module is a series of pictures exported to a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed using Google Earth format .
if you do the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do good when the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four steps with the module white .
many tools which need the photo el@@ aboration are in &amp; digi@@ plug ; contain their description here .
all image processing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , soft@@ signs , rough@@ ing , reproduction , re@@ flux , and etc . use a single dialog box to preview the effect on the current image . below see &amp; quot ; texture user . in this dialog box :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current picture . to the left of him allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the anter@@ ior area . these modes are :
vertical parts without duplic@@ ates . the left area displays the original and the right shows the filter used on the right of the selected pre @-@ sc@@ ary area .
horizont@@ ally divide without duplic@@ ates . the upper section shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied on the area below the selected pre @-@ proof area .
vertical parts . the left section shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper section shows the original and lower the lower the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview window and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons which you can turn on to display over@@ and under@@ taking exposure . the used colors can be adjusted in general installation page .
( 3 ) : the frame for selecting the preview . you can put this frame with the mouse over the image and place on the part of the image , which you want to see the preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your standard values . all adjustment of the use of the module will be noticed .
the page bar features shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely un@@ explained . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo features : shows a summary of the most important parameters at the shoot of the photos . these data come from the EX@@ IF data when these are available .
this rider does an intuitive card search tool available on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can move it out with the mouse wheel . press C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker mouse button to pull out a square . all pictures within this coordinates will be filtered and displayed . this is what you need to include your pictures of G@@ eo data .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is an editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used for work of color pall@@ ets and to choose and use colors of colors .
the pall@@ ets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be installed either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; Settings and hot @-@ defined colour and last used colors .
in the dialog box , you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or browse the folder to files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed in the palm view as line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a colour .
it shows the colour next to the colour . colour is described under the pallet view . here also the colour name can be changed .
it can also be used to select such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor there . then move the mouse to pressed left mouse button .
if the check box In the button is inserted , the color is inserted from the color panel on the cur@@ sor position . the color will be either inserted or over@@ write a different ; depending on whether the mode is over@@ write . this mode can be set by clicking the check box under the lower cur@@ sor .
a selection , which was created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions copying , cutting and insert .
&amp; col@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; used the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional colour name , followed by a line @-@ sign , if there are three num@@ eric values in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; col@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ;
the colors in the pallet and the output of the colour selection can be drawn with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then you can find in colour sel@@ ector on the left .
&amp; c@@ graph@@ ically ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . graph@@ s are used in science , particularly in computer science . so far , there were not a modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphics . the programs , the &amp; graphic ; includes , are used to view the program author &amp; X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with just a few functions .
the &amp; c@@ graph viewer ; project has set itself the goal to replace these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphic surface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program to replace .
&amp; c@@ graph@@ ically ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programmes . &amp; graphic viewer . features graph@@ s with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ( such a change in the Graph@@ ene in &amp; Kate ; the graph is re@@ charged and in &amp; c@@ graph@@ ically ; represents )
menu to open the Graph@@ s in &amp; Kate ; open or graph@@ s in &amp; graphic viewer ; open in a &amp; Kate ; component component
download large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems from about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to present more than these no@@ des )
further required software : &amp; c@@ graph@@ ically ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that requires the &amp; graphic ; -@@ Tool &amp; dot ; for the presentation of the graph . needed in detail :
the main window shows the opened graph , each in a separate lower window . initially , if you open &amp; k@@ graph . in this case , the tool@@ bar will only open the symbol file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog file .
once you have one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the lower screen photo :
as you can see , an overview of the corner is displayed if the Gra@@ ph is bigger than the character surface . you can choose a solid position for this list or choose this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and r@@ less without special keys , left and right for pressed &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below , you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the just changes in &amp; k@@ not@@ viewer ; loaded file changed from another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the Gra@@ ph should be re @-@ loaded or if you want to ignore the change , you can also notice your decision , so that later , you can change your decision later , you can use the menu item Settings ... See also , see also .
if you can open a graphic file outside of a current &amp; k@@ graph ; instance , and eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ not@@ viewer ; instance , or want to inv@@ ent graph@@ s in a sub@@ window of the already ongoing instance .
as with the latest option , you can save your choice permanently , but these can also change with the dialog dialog .
when program start , you can open all the graph@@ s of your last session . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also define such as Gra@@ ph should be divided into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be selected .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graphics that will be on one side , on this page will be igno@@ red . if the aspect ratio will be igno@@ red , the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph .
side@@ ways with one on several sides distributed graph@@ s without head@@ line and with another font
the site returns the way to determine the behaviour if a file has changed on the hard disk , and eg ; from another program . you can define a standard behavior ( automatically re@@ load or ignore the changes ) or the program every time .
the page opening is possible to open the behaviour of &amp; k@@ graph ; if a Gra@@ ph open outside a running session . you can open a standard behavior for this case ( the graph in a new window or specify the current session ) or determine that every time is required .
the site seating management gives the option to set the start @-@ up of &amp; k@@ graph . you can define a standard behavior ( the files from the last meeting or not ) or determine where the start is being asked to be asked .
the context menu , which normally appears with a click on the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n window , opens further options :
here you can choose among different &amp; graphic algorith@@ ms ; choose the entries as they are described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for directional graph@@ s . he produces hier@@ arch@@ ical or stories of directed graph@@ s . the algorithm produces edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or left to right ) and then try to produce very short edges and as possible few can@@ ons .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s . it produces represent@@ ations in accordance with the diving spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is significantly improved with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm produces a diving @-@ top layout for un@@ eri@@ zed graphite model layout . it uses the fru@@ gal pure gold header , and includes a general trigger for the treatment of large and clust@@ ered graph@@ s .
the &amp; cir@@ co ; algorithm calcul@@ ates the no@@ des of a shape in accordance with the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and Kau@@ ff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which will then use a layout command as parameters , and the calculated layout of Graph@@ ene to st@@ d@@ out in the x@@ dot format . with such a layout command you can give &amp; eg ; the &amp; graphite specific options , or modify the graphics with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of graph@@ s ( directed or un@@ sealed ) and turn the default algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directional , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ eri@@ zed graphite ) .
if this setting is enabled , the overview will be displayed if this is necessary . otherwise it is not displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .

image Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can lead a number of selected images with a GPS track .
select the pictures you want to cor@@ related to the main window and call the menu on . the above mentioned dialog appears . in order to load a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to download a track file with GP@@ X file . this file contains naturally data collected on the same places like images of your camera .
if the file is loaded automatically , the coordinates will be recorded in red . GPS track data will be recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore , the camera will be converted to GMT . this can be performed with the time zone . continue to place your camera zone .
setting for the maximum time vari@@ ance is an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera exposure . lies the deviation below . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from a place you can edit the GP@@ X file and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ related all images in this range .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t know that in reality a location in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can set this limit here and then push the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ishing .
the coordinates can be manually set with this dialogue . this is useful if you have a number of photos on the same place . since the dialog will use the button OK to use only the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found with the displayed map and to be set . select the appropriate region and enlarge it again by , until you have reached an adequate accuracy . the card must always be manually selected . the card can be changed manually between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the pictures . here &apos;s a small script that the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.0@@ 1 . you can select the albums that are exported to HTML pages . the character set will be encoded with UTF @-@ 8 encoding to make a best possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four riders that can be adapted to the settings . the riders selection allows you to select the albums that are to be exported to HTML . you will not need to select this albums . with the three buttons on the right hand you can select a large number of albums . in the area including the Al@@ ben@@ ch@@ Show and the text of the HTML page will appear .
the rider appearance defines the general look and layout for each side . this rider is largely created itself . if you click on an image , a new page will be displayed in the picture . otherwise , the picture is displayed directly to your standard picture , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ch@@ show , displayed
the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery is stored with all your related pictures . choose a folder where you can write a folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you select JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information is stored in the new pictures also in the new pictures .
with other color depth , you can change the default color depth . the file size is naturally also un@@ explained . all other settings are even explained .
the rider pad@@ dock allows you some of the settings from the album rider for the preview images , which are small pictures shown in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press the process to break the process .
if the module generates the pages this window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore start the program code to determine whether the error occurs during the creation . the web browser will automatically show the preview of the gallery . press Connect to connect the module .

the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in form of a slide .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length , add the packages of M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add a basic image file between the individual images . you can also add a audio file in MP@@ 2 or WAV of the Di@@ ash@@ au .
all images will be sc@@ aled automatically to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can create a background color for the selected video format . with this module , it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the images to be packed into MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au . then you can start the module via ex@@ tras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the images selected by you are under image files in the portfolio . you can also change the images or the content of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should custom@@ ize the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ VCD , SV@@ CD and VCD . PAL is pre @-@ set and most probably the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should specify the time in seconds . the speed of image transition will be specified among them . a low value creates very sudden , a high level of smooth image changes .
the background color can be set as the next one . in doubt you should set it black . the name and the path of the generated file you can define it under the name of the MPEG output file . keep them as if possible the En@@ um@@ mp@@ g .
if you specify a audio file under the name of the audio source file , you can start with the button . after you can start your computer with the button . depending on the speed of your computer you can now drink a coffee or drink in all tranquility if you are back again .
if a hint appears that co@@ dec or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages on the right below .
the print assistant allows several pictures on one sheet paper to print together in standard Photo@@ sizes . the combined pictures can also be opened automatically with the image processing g@@ im@@ p . this is a sense to improve it or print with Gim@@ p module to direct expression .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can convert your RAW format saved in one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM respectively .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w from Dave Coff@@ in . a original version of Him is : expect from d@@ c@@ w not that there are the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ c@@ w better results ! .
first , select the RAW file to be converted and start the module . the R@@ aw image conver@@ ter window appears in mode for a single image . with the button you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings are to be used to the white . the key parameters such as gamma , brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can further edit the picture later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected to use the contrast information . if your camera has been working in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview you can choose one of the three output formats and converting the conversion result . JPEG uses a loss algorithm . JPEG uses a loss algorithm and produces the smallest file size .
tagged image format , TIFF , keeps all information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ free L@@ Z@@ W compression .
if you &apos;re using your images frequently or later you should not continue to use JPEG format , since there is only a limited number of operations before the image quality is deterior@@ ated . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose to JPEG as a memory format , the met@@ ad@@ ata will be stored in the RAW file in the EX@@ IF information .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion button . if you want to break this process , you can ab@@ using this process .
the pile @-@ processing mode allows you to convert various images to one time . do not use this mode if you are sure , for example , by testing in a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual pictures . however , this is helpful if these were created in an earlier attempt . however , this is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all images in a album . it uses the program to convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used for ren@@ aming all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix to set the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the stamp .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection . it is used to reduce the image from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can reduce the image or enlarge it :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , in dependence of the image orientation , selected . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to match your image format .
non proportional : non@@ propor@@ tion@@ ate size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed for this option .
pressure preparation : prepar@@ es the image for the photo @-@ pressure . the user can adjust the pressure resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , bound@@ ary size and background color is adapted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can send selected pictures with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the connected pictures in advance . more images can go to the list of the connected pictures and place there .
after you have launched the module , the pictures will be displayed with you your chosen images . you can add more pictures to the button dialog . for the last chosen image , a preview of the click will be displayed on the right side .
you can also drag images to the picture list and add a way to add the list of to a sen@@ sel@@ ing pictures .
remove the pictures from the list of the selected images from the list .
after you have selected all the pictures you can open the button OK with the button OK . you &apos;ll need to add the addresses and the subject to the subject . these images are already attached as an app@@ endix .
do not pay attention to many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have restrictions on the size of the e @-@ mails . it may be a good idea to send several mails if you want to send many pictures .
the E @-@ Mail Window is used to change the settings for the sending of the images . your configuration is stored and changed once again until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you need to specify the right path for your installation .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you need to install the GM@@ ail@@ Agent on your computer . you can download this here .
after the selection of comments in a fixed file , comments on the pictures are put together into a text file and email .
the PNG format below the menu file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted under the los@@ s@@ less formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you want to have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend to JPEG format .
if you select JPEG under Pictures file format and select the original files in JPEG format , then the original Ex@@ i@@ f@@ data will be added to the sen@@ sel@@ ess pictures .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically , so you can watch the status messages , on the search for errors . your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end . with the button closure , you can get this window sch@@ lie ? EN .
after starting the Modul@@ s Advanced Di@@ asch@@ al , a window will be presented with questions like you want to show your Di@@ asch@@ au . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album .
the Open@@ GL trans@@ itions option in the presentation allows very elegant image outputs using Open@@ GL . however , you have to own a corresponding graph card , otherwise the Di@@ asch@@ al will be very slow .
the fil@@ en@@ ame option ensures that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the pictures will be displayed in the left corner during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an end loop . you can then remove manually using Es@@ c ;
the option is random@@ ly chosen that the images will be displayed in a random order . it is not used in the order of the images in the album .
among delay between the images may be set between different pictures . 1500 millisecon@@ ds are set to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . you should test this way before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly sel@@ ects each transition between the pictures a different effect .
during the Di@@ asch@@ au , you can access to a tool@@ bar at the top left screen . move the mouse into this corner to switch you .
with this tool bar you can hold the presentation and start back to the previous and next picture and stop the Di@@ ash@@ au .
on the left side of the screen , you can see the current file names , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the ma@@ iling list of K@@ IP@@ I teams under k@@ de @-@ im@@ aging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. attention : participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background picture is a tool to set a picture as background picture for the working surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the lower part , as a background for your K@@ DE work@@ surface .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can see with &amp; k@@ out album ; by these browsers , see picture . as you can see by a comparison with the picture , so in any group , so in people , places and in group words .
in the browser window you can see the categories as you have entered information and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to view the file structure on your hard disk , and of course the current look at . in the following is described for itself .
if you press with the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser window is changing . see picture .
if you select one more person , only the pictures are displayed on which both individuals can be seen . by this selection method , you can restri@@ ct the number of images displayed by a few thousand images on a few single pictures .
if you have selected all people , places and other settings , you can view with preview images to view the pictures of your active area .
in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of their names . you can store with &amp; k@@ ite album ; however , for every person an own eyes , this is also true for locations , pass@@ words and other categories that you own themselves . see also the picture .
in order to view images next to the name , select the button where you want to use the right outside on the tool@@ bar . please note that you can view the view for each category . this has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of persons and simultaneously a list of sample files ( if you have no suitable pictures for your words ) .
however , you must also specify the image for each individual person . in order to see this , you &apos;ll need to custom@@ ize the image editor , as shown in the picture window , you can custom@@ ize the magni@@ fication factor according to your requirements and thus select which part of the image will be rendered or cut .
if you are looking for searching in the main window , you will see a dialog box which is very similar to the illustration of the image properties . this dialog can look at the picture once again .
if you want to enter a character sequence or descriptions of the pictures to this text , if you want , you can also enter a date , so for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all images after certain names , as you can see in the picture . here , on images , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ ite album ; if you don &apos;t like to read manu@@ als , but rather to test functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ ite album ; and check out the fast entry , screen photos and the introductory videos .
start &amp; check out Album ; and select in the first dialog for the demo if you start &amp; check out Album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry to the menu entry into the menu . as a result , some example images are loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ ite album ; try out .
if you prefer to print this manual you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ ite album ; as a program HTML document to download .
at the bottom edge of the main window of &amp; k@@ ite album ; see the time bar here . a picture of this l@@ avi@@ est see here : . as the name already says , these will show you data statistics about the pictures in your database .
the time bar can display several different time units . each strip indicates a different unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying the strip only 10 minutes sections .
the time bar can be used on the following ways : you can change the displayed preview view from the database ( if you select a date , you will always look the first picture of this date in preview window ) and also shows the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in preview View .
you can also select a range of time bar by pressing the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the time bar , so the time values are displayed . you can select the selection only pictures of this period . you can select the selection by clicking on a bar of the time bar .
&amp; k@@ ite album ; presented to you two options available to create HTML websites with your images . the one is available in &amp; k@@ ite album ; integrated and the other than module available ( see ) . in the following part of the user book , the text is described in &amp; k@@ out album ; integrated version you can create about the menu file HTML ... call .
before HTML pages you need to make some settings . these are described in the three areas of content , layout and finish . the following is described in the following areas .
first enter the title of the review and a description which should contain the HTML file later . on the list box ; HTML example pages you can see an example of this settings .
next , you choose whether a &amp; k@@ ite album ; export file is to be created on the review page . do more information about export files you will find in .
last , you can select which information can be displayed on the HTML pages . so , for example , all pictures are displayed by a party . please note that all pictures are exported . currently you can &apos;t use this setting to hide certain pictures from certain viewing lights .
in this range you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most of the installation options are clearly , why not for this purpose .
below the page you can adjust different resolutions for the pictures . as you have to view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600 , no images can be downloaded , for example a resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer &apos;s viewer can change the dis@@ solution at any time . it can thus change your images with low resolution , which means to a lower transfer time , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting area , select the various folders and the URL to where your site is stored .
at best , choose a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent sentence .
first , you need to select the main folder where all your pictures are stored . this folder will be stored and automatically supplemented by the next time . this folder you can select either a folder or by K@@ DE supported protocol , for example :
after you have created your pictures , you may check if this really is visible for the base folder , a web browser after the pages have been created , the URL should be specified here . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created in the final target folders you need to copy them manually . thus , the import function , see , correctly , you will need to specify the final goal of files . this is not the folder of the current files but the base folder where all sub @-@ folders are located .
the just described positions have all three basic folders or UR@@ Ls . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name can be fixed in the output folder .
if you are looking forward to a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or anywhere else , you would like to create a HTML page for viewing the images . if you already have a lot of time to view the images . if you already have a lot of time to consider the pictures , recording location , etc . , this work must not be done once again .
with &amp; k@@ ite album ; you can import a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import other into your database . they are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im -@@ files , internal and external . they distingu@@ ish themselves whether the images can be stored inside the file , or if the images can be stored in the file , you can put all the pictures into the file , and this file is so independent . the obvious down@@ side is the file size .
you can convert a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu file expor@@ ting ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file search the pictures at two times . first , the pictures will not be found in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . these images will not be found when creating the HTML files , this is only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for expor@@ ting pictures will be described above the menu file expor@@ ting up menu .
the most important option of this dialog is to do if it is an internal or external .@@ k@@ im -@@ files . there are the following three selection options available :
with the option Manual close to .@@ k@@ im @-@ file you need to copy the pictures into the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im @-@ file .
with the option Autom@@ atically copy the .@@ k@@ im @-@ file to copy and copy the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im -@@ files are normal Zip files . as most pictures have been compressed using JPEG . if you want to comp@@ ress the files even very small , if you want to comp@@ ress this , simply select the export file option .
the last option of this page is maximum picture size . if you would like to send your friends pictures if the .@@ k@@ im file would be very big . here you can limit the size by example , by example , that each picture should be at maximum 800 pixels high and wide .
if you want to import a file using the folder .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file impor@@ ting ... select &amp; k@@ ite album ; the expor@@ ting database as described in described .
the assistant to impor@@ ting consists of four steps . first you need to select which pictures you want to import , in which folders should be copied to import pictures .
it can be that you are called the category of people to imported file the category ( if you are a D@@ ans ) , while this category is required for your database . therefore , you will be imported in the third dialogue window , which are to be imported in categories as well as these categories in your database .
in the fourth step you can read the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database . one example you can see on the picture .
it must be easy to browse pictures to browse and see : if one sees pictures , you &apos;d like to watch pictures of your Italy vacation and see a picture with your friend you would like to see all the pictures on which this friend can be seen .
in this manual you will find the different steps from ( 1 ) fixed the information about your pictures , about ( 2 ) to search and see up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and adap@@ ting possibilities .
K@@ Photo@@ album was started as a program for managing your pictures . however , it was expanded and today &apos;s your videos . in many places in this manual you have talked about pictures but often simply closes these videos with one .
&amp; k@@ ite album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of their images . this is a simple XML file which you can use with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ male backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in CV@@ S , where you want to .
&amp; k@@ ite album ; re@@ members the folder where your pictures are stored and uses this with future start again . if you want to start another folder in &amp; k@@ ite album . if you want to start another folder with pictures , you can start &amp; k@@ out Album ; with the -@@ c option -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
via the menu entry Settings menu ; configure ... get to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ ite album ; in the following section of the user book you will be explained .
on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can call the possibilities of preview and options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which allows you to retri@@ eve your F1 key and click on the desired option .
in fact , as you can create different features such as objects , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
you can see the dialogue that is used to process already existing groups . for each existing group you can choose a labelling and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialog box options , you can teach complete membership groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a medi@@ ator as explained in .
you can see the setup possibilities which are available to you to configure membership groups . in the top window you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window , you can select a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ ite album ; divi@@ des its modular system with other graphic applications such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this modular system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plug@@ in interface . you can find on the homepage from Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be called via the menu modules . the modules can be viewed and are not described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; k@@ ite album ; however , most modules have a help page which can call for the modules itself .
since the modules of several applications are common to each other , it can always be tested with the demo database before you want to retri@@ eve it on your own pictures ; demo database can be found either via the command line with the command &gt; k@@ um@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu help . do not say , I would not have war@@ ned !
the applications that use modules above K@@ IP@@ I have been common , are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ out Album ; do not work . this is the down@@ side when you share functions with various applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ ite album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications have not supported their images in albums , this type of order is not supported , simul@@ ate it for some modules the order to albums , so you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ ite album .
it simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ ite album ; the current album that simply corresponds to the current view , so all the images that show you the picture preview now .
in addition to the current album , &amp; k@@ ite album has to pass the modules , even a list of albums . here goes &amp; k@@ out Album ; as follows :
when &amp; k@@ ite album ; s browser shows the contents of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry represents a record for the module .
or it is the category that you have specified in the dialog for virtual albums as a category for virtual albums . if you can use the category for example , if you have selected the category for example , so if you have selected persons to view and add this module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ ite album are not compatible , you can remove this from the list of modules . start the installation dialog and select the modules installed which modules are to be loaded .
on the picture you can see an example for a start screen once you start &amp; k@@ out Album ; start your own pictures .
as you have been used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see the window with which you have entered your image database . currently , we don &apos;t have any more information about your pictures . in the section we will see on this window , then click on the picture to show you an overview with all existing images .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ ite album ; is the opportunity to see each picture with notes , where the image has been taken on the picture where the image has been recorded separately or for a larger number of images assigned simultaneously . if for example , on all images of Jes@@ per , and all pictures were taken up in Copenhagen .
all of these notes can be used for searching and browser , as you can read in the section . if you want to see this notes when you use the built @-@ in viewer .
in case you can see three lists with a text field by taking people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ ite album ; if you &apos;re still using information on your images .
the following idea is to move the pictures within the list : if you are looking for example a family party and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 people can be viewed , so that the names are moved to the above , can be found faster and easily .
if you prefer to see an alphabetical list of alphabetical list , click on the icon to list under the list .
if you have selected comments for each image , you wish to edit any selected images and add these pictures with notes . just click on the buttons and back buttons , which are located under the preview of the picture to the top .
if you have several images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to select all these pictures and add the menu item multiple entries at one time with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California .
on the picture you can see a Brow@@ ser@@ window of the US as an over@@ group . in order to show you , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the atten@@ u@@ alog@@ s is it possible to add an entry to a sub@@ category or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also add an entry to a sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this assumes that you are involved in alphabetical order alphabet@@ ically . see here .
you can move the individual elements of the concern di@@ alog@@ s by clicking on the edges of the frame , click and post@@ p@@ one . you can also make your own window by drag him outside the window area .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs , you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button options ... , which offers you the possibility to save the current structure and the appearance of the window .
you can also view a frame completely . if you want to recover this window later , use the button options ... and here then window will see a / off . this procedure can be seen in the picture .
if you select the entry images in your browser , you will get an overview of the current selected images , or all the pictures if you don &apos;t have a filter . for example , you can see the size of the keys , by simply follow the mouse button with the middle mouse button . try it just once .
when you cover a picture on the background of your desktop , this picture is set up as background images for your desktop .
when you click on an image , this picture is displayed in the image . if you have no window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the picture presentation . simply select the corresponding images from which you want to delete or choose either the removing button or select the menu click here . now you will see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ ite album ; you can also use a solution for this problem . you can also use the pictures without you saved on the hard drive . in the picture you can see the pictures anywhere , so you can see the pictures from the hard disk image . in the picture you can see the view from &amp; k@@ itt@@ ens ; if not all required images from hard disk can be loaded .
images , where the right corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . for images 5 @-@ 9 , however , these pictures are present , so that your images can show you the preview of this pictures . however , you can also view this pictures with the image .
as you see this function you need to copy files from the folders and copy it again . if you want to avoid any longer a CD , if you want to avoid any other hard drive , please purchase a larger hard drive to save all the pictures .
in the menu pictures you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to make a little more privacy , see the pictures so that you may see for others in@@ accessible in the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also see all the images that may see your little sister , you will see and select the menu item anything out of current view .
in order to set the images in the case of the thread , you will simply lock the menu entry to your little sister , so that all the pictures you want to be blocked off . if you want to recover the pictures again , click to Sper@@ re .
it is also possible to set a password which must be entered for un@@ lock the pictures . in order to set up this password , you will simply change password in the menu privacy .
please remember that this picture protection must not be very safe . for example , all images on the hard drive and others can only read or delete this type of password protection . this type of password protection is only for those who are familiar with &amp; k@@ out album ; not very familiar , looking at private pictures .
the reason why you can manage all your images with &amp; k@@ out album ; manage and hours over hours therefore , of course you want to view it sometime . from this reason &amp; k@@ ite album . this is what you can see from the preview as described in .
the viewer can see the viewer . it shows the picture , but additional all the information you have shown on the picture , such as anyone is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the Info@@ box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , so you can configure this simply using the mouse , and what information can be displayed . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . all of these options are shown below .
some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here to see your browser on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you have been selected from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have multiple pictures in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back , by using the buttons picture high and picture . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if multiple pictures are up@@ loaded in the viewer , you can then press this as Di@@ asch@@ au . &amp; k@@ ite album ; invites you to press a new picture after a few seconds . as often a new picture can be checked by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l button and plus Min@@ us by buttons C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful ability of the viewer &apos;s viewer is to be able to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
if you are using the viewer , you can easily go into the picture and get out with the mouse . using the Min@@ us button , you can zoom out again to the middle of the picture . shows how a Zoom @-@ rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point @-@ button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not drawn with the zo@@ oms , so that each pixels is equivalent to a pixels of the image .
note that the only zo@@ om@@ operations work with videos that come in and out with the Plus@@ - and Min@@ us .
with the script functions from the context menu you can turn the image . this does not work with videos . you can note ann@@ ot@@ ations on the actual picture with the menu item notes from the context menu .
if you have a look at the picture you can see a picture of a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can open the image and configuration dialog of the picture to select this name . however , you will have to mark the picture to mark and look more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the pictures on paper . to see what photos you want to start the viewer with the pictures and try them as good or bad , while you can see one after the others .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the opportunity to view images with features while you watch them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature so that you can press the corresponding letters . in the case you can see a picture where the A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your pictures , you can view it in your browser . if you are reading all the pictures you can edit , print or whatever you have selected , so you can use one module to copy the selected images on a CD or what you want to do .
categories and particularly features can be displayed in the view screen . if you can view categories in D@@ re Pre@@ viewing view , then you can add features to the pictures by clicking the letters for the characteristic , after the picture was selected . this can see here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show in a picture . for this case allows you to paint &amp; k@@ out Album ; on the picture .
the gem@@ old is not stored with the image , but in the database . on the way you can make your gem@@ old later back then .
in case you can see a picture on the picture . in order to switch to the Mal@@ mode of &amp; k@@ ite album , then select on the picture from the context menu . to finish the M@@ alen . simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler , you must have the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully rule , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understood .
in the Object tree , you can select individual objects . then the properties displayed in the object properties are displayed and the object is displayed in the wire rope : yellow .
you can also select several objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object because all objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object , click the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu .
if there are more possible positions , the following hing@@ ed menu will be available , so you can choose the right position :
to delete either from the menu bar , or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed characteristics , click on user to take these changes . you can inv@@ alid values , a message is displayed with an error description . then you can change the input error and click on the user or modify the changes with dis@@ rup@@ ting .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; enter user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object using the help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 provides the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview of the own view .
press a preview of the scene with the selected texture , and a little example of the scene will be selected with the selected texture . if you want to select a sub@@ ordin@@ ate item ( for example , a texture within a texture map and not the whole texture map ) , are crossed locally .
the screenshot shows the control points of the camera . you can draw up these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is elected , marks disappear the control points and it is displayed a small cross in the wire @-@ section view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shi@@ fts . you can change the shift through pulling out with the mouse within the entire window .
each object has a visual inspection level . you can specify this value relative to the visible object of the superior object or as an absolute value . objects are displayed only if they are selected or their visual levels of small or equal to the visual stage of the scene .
&amp; K@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window arrangement as a default . the object @-@ tree and view of the object characteristics are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
if you do not like the standard shut@@ ters , or if you need a different arrangement , you can store them as desired . you can also save multiple sh@@ ields and easily between different arrangements .
to ensure a window over or under a view over view , drag the fol@@ ds to the upper or lower edge of a view . a rectangle below shows the new position .
to create a new column , please take a look at the right or left side of a view . the new view will be an@@ cho@@ red on the right or left side of this view and extends over the overall height .
if you want to arrange multiple views over each other , take the list on another view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card reader re@@ amer above in the views .
the last possible window frames are floating views : views that are not en@@ shr@@ ined in the main window . to solve a view from the anchor , drag the counter top to the top left or click the little arrow on the left corner .
to complete a view , click on the small cross in the An@@ fass@@ er@@ bar . to prevent the closing , click the small square between arrow and cross .
you can add additional views to the main window . in the menu , you will find entries for any type of views . new views are floating , you can combine it in any position .
the current window view can save you to view window frames ... save . it is displayed a dialog where you can save the window order under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ ders them . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for Ren@@ ders , this program has to be installed properly . as this manual is written , it was not supported by P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene , click on the icon Ren@@ ders &quot; icon in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry view scene .
a R@@ ender mode meets the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of the rendering . if you want to add a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can add any number of R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview up to full images in highest quality .
if you click on the icon of the R@@ ender settings in the tool@@ bar or in the menu pane R@@ ender modes ... , the following dialog will be opened :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it is a name that can recognize the features of the mode .
in the map size , you can ren@@ ounce the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to ren@@ ders a small area of the image , select the box section and enter the image section to the rendering in the input fields .
in combination with quality , you can select the properties that uses &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used by a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ user refle@@ x lighting . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties are found in the us@@ and@@ buch / P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if an image is rendered with only one beam per pixel , there are often different errors . these pictures have often appear a mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or stud effects in curves and lines , sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing , to reduce the influence of these errors . in general , pictures will look better with this feature .
if you turn off anti @-@ ali@@ asing , and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technology means great sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . the second method is adap@@ tive and non @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively , because each pixels is split again and adap@@ tive to the calculated values of the calculated colour values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray persecuted a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold . if you calculate the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be charged , with a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) extra rays each pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays each . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , then the pixels will be divided into 4 sub @-@ pixel , which can be controlled individually and to further sub@@ division . maximum depth of rec@@ ur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another possibility to reduce ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you switch J@@ itter@@ ing , changing &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; radi@@ ates a tiny amount to avoid regular samples .
the last setting for quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection is calculated . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this card card you can set whether the alpha channels are calculated by POV @-@ Ray . one pixel is transparent if the associated rays have no object .
opens a new window for displaying &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason for this .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ scene to import , select the menu entry file impor@@ ting ... and select a file in dialogue window .
currently &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler is currently not supported by the full command line of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; when impor@@ ting error messages or war@@ nings , a dialog window shows a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; import the source between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ ning and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ end .
you can draw objects from the object tree into the editor to import the source file for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this add the source file in the editor . to import objects in the scene , select the source text in the editor and drag him to the Object tree .
with copying and insert in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor , you can also insert source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also included .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler is a scene . it usually is p@@ ov@@ ray or x @-@ p@@ ov@@ ray .
if you click on the help of your own view , opens &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the quoted object . set here the path to your document and the version . supported versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; sear@@ ches for external files ( for example al@@ p data ) into the path to the p@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you enter files that are not in the folder of the scene , you will also need to get the path to these files here . if a file is used in different paths of the library , the first folded file is used .
the color for wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rectangle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type characters .
you can adjust the object @-@ cat@@ cher of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire @-@ screen views . you can adjust the grid separately for shi@@ fts , sc@@ aling and turning .
larger values indicate an accurate wire model and therefore a better sewing unit for the displayed objects , but require more time to rendering . for some objects , such as the ball you can set the detail level for two directions .
if you cross the highly detailed proj@@ ections for extended proj@@ ections , all the camera are using a extended projection . extended proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions to the perspective and vertical proj@@ ections . this feature gives a better approach for the proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ ders .
when you cross a wall , there is a wall behind the objects . the wall is displayed in a chess boards from two adjustable colours .
when you cross the bottom , there is a floor below the objects . the ground is displayed in a chess boards from two adjustable colours .
if you need to dis@@ connect the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method for the ren@@ ders of scenes . the values for depth and sw@@ elling value can be set . more details on the parameters can be found in section R@@ ender modes .
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the section window orders will explain how to create windows and save .
the standard version of standard shut@@ dow@@ ns : displays all existing window orders . &amp; K@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler is used for the selected window of shut@@ ters at the start of the program .
the list box arrangements shows all existing window orders . a new arrangement allows you to create and delete a selected arrangement with the button removing the button .
each window order is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list below the name displays all the views of the selected window of window . new views can be created with the button to add and delete selected views with the button Remove .
the position of the new window . with new column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with un@@ equi@@ ps the window under the existing window , with card card you will receive a card box view together with the previous view and web@@ master the view is not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just returned &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler is installed and now you would like to follow no more accurate knowledge of the two programs . if you are able to build all the steps in this tutorial , you should have the ultimate scene with very popular : a ball on a plain .
but you should keep following warning warning , before you compl@@ ain about it , that you can use a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program to first time , you should note these important rules :
if you don &apos;t set off any camera , no rules for the ren@@ ders can be applied , as a result you will get a black image .
if you add no light sources , your entire scene is in the dark and you get only a black image .
if you have any error free installed , see the first start of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; the following pre@@ set shut@@ ters are installed :
take a little time to meet the menus and using existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . read the documentation that you can get an appropriate idea what you can expect from this program .
you will now have to use these menus and symbols now , therefore you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; K@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . mark the scene and then select the menu entry . so you have a scene without objects .
the wire @-@ model view shows how the camera is considered to create the whole scene . in particular , note that in the fourth wire @-@ model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view@@ point of the camera . this shows you the outcome of the scene .
the Object tree now contains a new record with the designation camera . if you click on view , see the content of view object properties , where the different parameters of the camera will find . in user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; find additional details .
change anything to the basic settings of the camera , this is later subject to the basic settings of the camera , which you can change the camera in view of the camera , with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click on the left mouse button on a control point and drag him to the desired position .
if you push the button users or input buttons , the wire @-@ model views and the object is immediately change according to these settings . as a result they see the scene from the view@@ point of the camera .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could adjust for example a Qu@@ ader ( insertion body Qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is an enormous approach to solve these task .
&amp; K@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler is actually a simple way . you can use an infinite layer as ground :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and press the button user or input buttons . the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire @-@ model view now shows the level as well as in the moment only as a limited level . if you ren@@ ders the scene , extends the plain to the horizon .
if you can view the object tree , you &apos;ll notice that you can see the entry for the bottom . in this case you can see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . choose one of these options , also change the possible settings in view of the object characteristics .
in this scene , you should post@@ p@@ one the floor to exercise a unit below the horizontal line , only in order to get some of these parameters . select shi@@ fting and set the values as follows :
select the ground only to hire its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose a bit Easy in the moment .
in both cases a dialog box opens in which you can select how the object is inserted . please choose the object . the pigment is displayed in the object tree ( name = bottom @-@ pigment ) , with one click on the button preview you can see how the pigment now looks .
of course , the preview of the pigments is just a matte black material because you can still need to check the appearance of materials at any time with one click on preview . specify the colors for the pigment . also , there are many possibilities now , but you can now take the easiest ways now .
if you don &apos;t see in the preview of no color on Qu@@ ader and ball , click on the button and call the preview .
the material for the floor is now correct . if you ren@@ ders your image now with one click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , you are not able to enter the color . here are further settings required . in the color version you need two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can also edit this entry twice , but the chess boards @-@ color list can only be used with two colors ) :
choose the object tree jed@@ es@@ mal once and change the colours in the view of the object characteristics :
this step should you already be able to run as you have the basic work of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler you should have . the ball is just as easy as the ground :
in view of the object properties you can change the settings . use the value for the radius : to 1 ( don &apos;t forget to push the input or push the button ) , so that the ball has a ball over the ground , as you have shifted the floor to a unit down@@ wards .
of course , the ren@@ ders makes now a simple result : as already in advance , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . put the following step into a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball you can now show a material now . as already in the bottom , enter the ball a pigment as colour :
select the first object and change the name for example in sphere pigment . click on ball pigment , select one color and set the values as follows :

then change the values like in the following screen photos and click on user or pressing the input .
the brightness effect and reflection result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrom@@ ed surfaces , even if metal : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression what you have to offer you &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler . hop@@ efully , you have already learned as much as you can create nice scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a r@@ ender method to create a double @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
if you ra@@ cking a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that reflects the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the R@@ ender calculated as this beam is reflected in the scene and how atmospheric effects will work like the fog . so the scene pixels is processed for pixels .
as you can imagine , you will see without a camera , the camera is your eye , with which you see the scene . without a light source you can see nothing but the image is simple black . obviously , any scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog you can select a file that you have created before using &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler
whenever you open a new model or create a new model , the file is inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
have you saved the model already , it is stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you need to enter a name and disk space .
the scene is recovered in the last stored version . all changes since the last storage are rejected .
this menu entry can only be selected if you don &apos;t have any stored changes in the scene .
repeat the last back on the command . this menu entry can only be selected if you want to work properly .
stores the current window arrangement and opens up a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or an existing order .
in this menu you will find options for the setting of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; here you can change the appearance , the key root and the standard behavior .
opens a dialog for changing the button short@@ cut . you can change using this option pre@@ fix for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; commands to change or add new commands .
opens up a dialog for establishing the tool@@ bar . you can add this option tool symbols for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; add commands and remove .
a B@@ ump @-@ map is an option to feed rough surfaces without changing the surface , without changing the geomet@@ ric form of the object itself without changing to the geomet@@ ric form of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file both for a B@@ ump @-@ Map and also for a texture map .
basic body are simple geomet@@ rical forms which you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic body . these models will continue to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is an option to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis , by application of an image file as a color card .
&amp; ku@@ k show ; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser . the application features a file browser where you can select images on the ad .

&amp; sk@@ et@@ ite ; is an application for scanning of pictures , which do not make more than images to scan and drain .
&amp; sk@@ et@@ ite ; is an easy application to scan and collect images . &amp; sk@@ et@@ ite ; can be opened up for any picture or save the pictures at once in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can also show images in front of the store .
you can check the status of your scanner at the gentle Project page by scanning the information on this search page : HTTP / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ projected .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set at the command line of &amp; sk@@ et@@ ite ; with the command set @-@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened , or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog for selecting the scanner is opened .
the user can choose to select the scanner and press OK to open the scanner . ab@@ iting &amp; sk@@ et@@ ite ; finish .
other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ et@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not affect these options .
in order to insert a picture , the user can only start a pre@@ sch@@ aus@@ can and then scanning the scanning area for the final scan , which is started through preview button .
in order to select the picture better , the user can also zoom in the picture and out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom so that the complete preview in the window fits .
if the image has been selected then the final picture can be read with the Scan button .
when in the Save a preview can be selected in the settings , then the image will be displayed in a preview window as shown below , then the picture is stored and sch@@ lie ? EN leads to a demol@@ ition and you will get back into the main window .
by the button settings the ep@@ onymous dialog is opened before the main window . you can change the main settings here .

the D@@ COP interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly seen in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ COP @-@ functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , playlist , playlist and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition Amar@@ ok has some of its own command line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script can not run due to a missing depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all required modules are available and use the dialog , that user may not run a script .
ad@@ mitt@@ ance &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue B@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ binary V@@ 3.4 is . for this script . &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; .
you can find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a basis for your own scripts , or simply discover the required functions . they will quickly notice that the writing of scripts is relatively easy .
with the help of D@@ COP , your scripts can be exchanged with Amar@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is the use of command d@@ co@@ p ; that everyone should defeat each K@@ DE installation .
most script languages allow exec@@ uting external programs and commands . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; is usually used . this way can be called d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively easy . here is an example in Python :
&amp; am@@ arok ; sends al@@ erts to all current scripts . to this reason , scripts are going to monitor their standard entry and react accordingly to events . of course , a script will ignore the events even if there is no use .
configure the script to display the setup dialog . to save the saving and charging data , each script will take care of each script . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the work folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change sign@@ alized that a new piece is played . the script could now query &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ COP features further information on the new piece ( for example , the met@@ ad@@ ata or the unit length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ ly@@ ates a change of volume . the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ iz@@ able menu , custom@@ ize the path to the selected files of playlist , if a user @-@ defined menu item can also be identified . to remove the script file d@@ coded Not@@ u@@ Item ( Sub@@ men@@ it@@ em@@ Title ) , you can use the D@@ COP function d@@ coded Not@@ u@@ Item ( Sub@@ men@@ it@@ em@@ Title ) to be used to remove d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok script . e@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Item ( Sub@@ men@@ it@@ em@@ Title ) .
before &amp; when the user will stop a script , or if the user sends a script , sends &amp; am@@ arok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M is to be ready to do . this signal should be processed to do so for example , e.g. storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ ah script exec@@ utable can also install script packages that can be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , which can also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , so that users can clearly recognize the archive as a Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; am@@ arok ; 1.3 will only accept a script packages with the expanding amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should correct your script packages to correct .
the main square must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file right :
when your script package is ready , you can go up on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wik@@ i scripts page of &amp; am@@ arok ; use the category am@@ arok on k@@ de @-@ apps to use scripts .
&amp; am@@ arok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; am@@ arok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless sur@@ pris@@ ingly easy to use .

relative paths for manual stored files : if you enable this setting , becomes &amp; am@@ arok ; relative paths to music files , starting from the location of the playlist , otherwise , the absolute position of music files are stored .
actual piece of pieces at the unit causes that the playlist window will raise / off to keep the running piece always in the visible window area .
when changing the text browser , you will automatically switch to the context browser once the next piece is played .
in the section Picture you can adjust &amp; am@@ arok ; s appearance . the section is sub@@ section in three parts sub@@ section .
in the fonts section , you can select the use of various writings in &amp; am@@ arok ; otherwise you can select the scriptures for the following range : playlist window , Player window and context browser . press to select ... , so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the selection custom paint scheme , you can define the qu@@ al of choice and can define its own color scheme . use them including the activated colour design for front and background colour .
playback will continue to continue that &amp; am@@ arok ; after the program start playback will automatically continue with the piece on the site , with which it was stopped during the last meeting .
the sub@@ window on @-@ screen display allows you to use the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display , it is displayed , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click on select ... to select from the dialog to select the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes that the text is displayed in the O@@ SD .
own colors are giving you the option to adjust the O@@ SD colors for let@@ tering and background . one click on color surfaces will open the dialog for color selection . if the colors are not enabled , the pre @-@ set &amp; k@@ de ; colors are used .
the input field display text is displayed in the O@@ SD text . due to the input of plac@@ eholders the O@@ SD may be adapted to your needs . below , you will find a list of available space holder and what they mean .
the screen is intended for X@@ perfor@@ ama @-@ users . so you can define it on which screen a multi@@ player environment will appear to the O@@ SD .
the card card audio output allows you to select an audio driver from the selection box . some drivers enable additional entries in this card card .
the card collection is used to set all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and the type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , select &amp; am@@ arok ; according to music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box in addition to its name . this section also includes check boxes for inser@@ ting , as with the selected folders .
sub@@ folder recur@@ sively : this causes that &amp; am@@ arok ; both the crossed as well as their sub@@ folder as well as their sub@@ folder .

&amp; am@@ arok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . further information is available in the summary of functions and gallery with screen photos .
am@@ aro@@ K requires only the package K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE pack@@ ets have to have been installed ( including the included programs , for &amp; am@@ arok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have a small guide on how to comp@@ ile K@@ deli@@ bs minimum .
some functions like e.g. the O@@ SD requires that your window manager will work the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work for example difficulties . we try to assist am@@ aro@@ K on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because these provide excellent development environment .
probably , one of your files will make an error in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library for days . you can see this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de.@@ org and depend on the kap@@ ut@@ te file that caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and restore the collection again .
mostly , this is what the ad lib in reading the met@@ a information from this file system crashing . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de.@@ org .
if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; am@@ arok ; is somewhat mature .
make sure all of &amp; am@@ arok . libraries have been compiled with the same compiler version . if such as &amp; am@@ arok ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b , but with GCC 3.@@ 3.x , then this leads to crash when working the met@@ a @-@ information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then de@@ activate automation . if in@@ active for ... in setting of the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us to the backup of e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail address automatically when a crash ) and send us a good backup , the error is guaranteed .
this is that many program information can write data as UTF @-@ 8 in met@@ a information , but this is not as Unicode . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; File $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ pli@@ b ; my $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; error when writing the tags of $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &apos; , $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ pli@@ b . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ pli@@ b &apos;
&amp; am@@ arok ; s symbols are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , this is a well @-@ known error in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , this is a well @-@ known error in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes you can see the status de@@ activated on grey and half transparent . please note that in some cases up to three times a symbol must click on a symbol until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : cat@@ amar@@ an icon : symbol L@@ ook@@ up error : if you are using _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ m@@ ap@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then please check if am@@ aro@@ K uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ Qu@@ amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p Q@@ T .
in order to fix this error , you may need to remove any colon@@ izing Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that am@@ aro@@ K will find the right version first .
there are some possibilities . most installation problems clari@@ fy themselves at the lightest by the help of an expert your Uni@@ x@@ - or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or for developers . use the forum and I@@ RC at ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # .
bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please use there only one error when you find something at the container of an error in am@@ aro@@ v itself .
after the start of &amp; am@@ arok , only an empty playlist will appear . as there are music pieces there ?
that &apos;s easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files into the right part of playlist .
to keep the surface intuitive , the start window was converted into the Statistics window . you will find under ex@@ tras under ex@@ tras .
the importance of this symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the evaluation by the user , while the points will be calculated automatically .
to evaluate pieces where the playlist can be displayed in the playlist and select a column . click here in the new evaluation column to define the evaluation for a piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and press release on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select From playlist menu .
move a playlist file with the mouse into playlist and let them fall there , just as you would like it with other files . so easy is that : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , directly next to the clicking button , the button playlist is to save . click on it .

this does &amp; am@@ arok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must first listen to AL@@ SA . you can only look for most people the best choice if you are looking for a de@@ or with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coded them and sends the PCM data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS de@@ coding the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can spend directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use the G@@ Stre@@ amer Driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control centre sound &amp; multimedia sound system . enable sound server with highest possible priority ( see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ sw@@ ra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ de@@ cs that can cause playback . read this error report . read this error message in your AL@@ SA installation file .@@ as@@ oun@@ dr@@ c can also help .
either you do not use the Arts drivers but instead of G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia to obtain the faster Arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably you are using the Arts Driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been optimised for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts buffer in the control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . depending on the buffer , the less applications react to visu@@ aliz@@ ations . yes , this is an error , please help us to fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but when I would like to change G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crash@@ es &amp; am@@ arok . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . perform G@@ ST register to register all of the G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask in the I@@ RC Channel # g@@ amer .
try this ( end you am@@ aro@@ v before ! ) : - Load m@@ peg , comp@@ ile and install it as your normal user . remove the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer of all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ amer @-@ config ) and perform G@@ ST register again . start now &amp; am@@ arok .

&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program bur@@ ns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a flow ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ Once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a textile description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ k@@ is@@ ate ; : bur@@ ns all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all functions such as &amp; c@@ dr@@ on ; usually , &amp; K@@ 3@@ b . usually , &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; usually , &amp; c@@ dr@@ on ; however , has achieved a higher quality with burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . such programs are generally referred to as Ripper .
OGG Vor@@ bis Library : OGG Vor@@ bis is an entirely open , patented free and professional technology for handling audio encoding . OGG Vor@@ bis benefits from Open Source and is available in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ g@@ g Vor@@ bis decoder and encoder modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG audio decoder . it supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three Audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder used in terms of quality and speed using commercial en@@ co@@ ders . l@@ ame is used from the MP3 encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module , so you can read FLA@@ C files and write .
Lib@@ sn@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack decoder : further libraries for the processing of various audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg , it is possible for example to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files on a audio CD to burning .
SO@@ X : an auxiliary program that can convert between different audio formats and can be used . SO@@ X is used by SO@@ X Audio Encoder module .
Trans@@ code : a command line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ CD@@ Im@@ ager : a fully equipped authorization system for work , dis@@ assem@@ bler and analyze video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files on a standard level . that can be meaning@@ ful , e.g. for creating a mixed CD &apos;s and Mp3 collections may be meaning@@ ful ; without norm@@ alize the different recording level of different albums to the un@@ beautiful effect can be played differently according to music .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to open projects recently . the corresponding sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project .
stores the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked after a new record .
stores the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ames . K@@ DE &apos;s Dialog saving below is displayed with which you can select the folder and file name for the project file .
stores all opened projects . this is the same as you save for each individual project file .
closes the current project . if a project has changed and not yet saved , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after what to happen . you can then choose between saving and changes . you can also break the closing and open the project so open .
includes all open projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b is available for each of the stored project , which should be done so as you would have called for each project file .
closes all open projects and finished &amp; K@@ 3@@ b . for each of the stored project , it will be asked what should be done so as if you would have called file .
if you call this entry , you can choose from the published dialogue files to add to the project . this has the same effect when you find the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD .
opens the dialogue &quot; Bur@@ ning &quot; for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the characteristics dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , der &amp; K@@ 3@@ b . burning process can only be opened when the project already contains data .
opens the features dialog for the current project . here you can create a lot of project settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described above the right mouse button .
this entry is published only for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it is useful to import files from a previous session in the current project . this is useful if you are not using files for a multiple session CD . it is intended for you to see if this function is not used for you to see the media already existing files and folders .
this entry is published only for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this feature will be removed &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; , imported files from the current project . all other files are removed from the medium , it only ends the files before imported files .
opens the CD copy dialog . this also allows you to create a CD on another medium . alternatively , you can also use a copy of a CD that you can then burn sometime later . furthermore , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal coupling . you should also copy cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD copying dialog . this also allows you to create a DVD copy of a DVD to another medium which allows you to burn a copy of a DVD with the help of copying dialogue , therefore the target medium has to be big enough to record the entire ( vide@@ ot@@ ape ) data of the source media in the original form .
opens the dialog for delete a CD @-@ RW . thus , you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog for form@@ att@@ ing a DVD . with this dialogue you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) format , making the content completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you write the choice between the write modes and incre@@ mental .
bur@@ ns a burn CD image . the dialog will ask you to a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source that can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning buttons . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are not yet supported , but you need to use other tools such as No.1 g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
bur@@ ns a previously produced DVD image . the dialog will ask you to a * .@@ is@@ o file as data source , which then can be burned immediately by pressing the burning buttons .
an previously used DVD video can be converted . this dialog window will usually be used . this dialog window will usually be used . it contains information about the le@@ ased video , co@@ sting settings and even possibilities for changing the size and cutting black edges .
displays information about the inserted media . this information is displayed in the content and contain the features of the media , such as size and title length of CD or DVD .
displays a list of the tool@@ bars of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b . if an entry is crossed , the tool bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is crossed , a small l@@ ath at the lower edge of the window is displayed . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar will be bl@@ ended .
if the folder view is one or out . the folder view contains an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the content is enabled , whose content is shown in the content . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , lock and lock of the disk or throw away the media .
if the content is one or out . the content of view enables you to select and pulling files into the projection view . the content is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a drive with an appropriate CD / DVD was selected in the folder view .
if the copy bar in the projection view is a narrow area which is only visible if the projection screen has no real function , it looks pretty steep and separates the projection view clearly by the remaining views .
this opens a dialog box for changing the key arrangements for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b . after one of the available commands are chosen in the upper part , you can adapt the button order to further down@@ wards .
this starts the K@@ 3@@ b ; setup assist@@ ants . thus , the correct per@@ missions are needed to burn CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administrator rights are required , therefore you need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) .
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b . here you can work general program settings . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work on An@@ h@@ ie@@ b . this dialogue is intended for Person@@ alize and fine tuning of the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is , as many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ COP . interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a sh@@ ell@@ tran@@ script .
in order to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; you can use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or that something more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical , therefore , rather your taste and the type of your task is crucial , which the default programs you will give .
in this chapter , we assume that you can use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; you need to make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b is started . then enter something like the following at the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; program , supports &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two additional parts are described below .
the standard D@@ COP interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b features functions like cop@@ y@@ CD , format DVD and other functions for creating new projects .
D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ .@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DVD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ .@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ .@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ .@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ .@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ .@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ .@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ .@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ .@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ .@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ .@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ .@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ .@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ .@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ .@@ Project ( ) P@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ .@@ Project ( ) P@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ .@@ Project ( )
as a result such an cre@@ at@@ e@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you can create a D@@ COP reference to the newly created project : D@@ COP@@ Ref ( K@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) alternative , you get a reference to the project via # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the top of the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Pro@@ ject@@ interface , which can only be applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
the cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) , cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ string Par@@ ent ) , add@@ ur@@ l ( K@@ URL path , Q@@ string Par@@ ent ) , ( Q@@ string path ) , ren@@ ame@@ item ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string new@@ name )
so it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then add files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ interface cre@@ at@@ e@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@
&amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is an audio CD ; reader for &amp; k@@ de ; with him can easily be read and stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . also other formats are possible , depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( compressed ) to MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ free compression ) . currently , l@@ ame for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) are required . further co@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , select the title of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files ( generally one per title ) compressed into the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or other formats like the los@@ s@@ free FLA@@ C .
for the first step , read out the &amp; CD ; it is compiled by &amp; Audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost any distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this has to be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ pre@@ until ( for OGG ) or other co@@ ders have already been installed , so it is probably not necessary to comp@@ ile yourself . however , only the co@@ dec packages are needed , but if FLA@@ C is not used , the installation will not be required .
what encoding / file format should be used ? the chapter of the Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to co@@ di@@ ers , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia , to read out audio data from the &amp; CD ; if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device is not possible , it is not possible to handle an protected audio CD ; it is not possible to avoid the mechanisms of copy protection . simply avoid the purchase of copy protected audio CD ; s !
while the setup may only be made ( the setup dialog can be called as often as often as a suitable configuration . this leads to the hard disk . this leads ( hop@@ efully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , which can be regarded as frequent in the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which co@@ ders are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc . )
it can collect &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can work completely without network , whereby everything is recorded manually .
this is just a short list of commands of the main window . on the page , there are further information about how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the register maps for the configuration of the program .
the CD@@ DB request will start the CD @-@ data according to the setup tab CD@@ DB . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be produced . )
start reading and - when a encoder is configured in the tab code parameter Settings - the coding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available encoder , so that the selection can be read with another Encoder as the standard . it is recommended that before the encoder is configured in tab settings .
opens the file manager so that a already read file is selected to en@@ code a full &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of al@@ erts ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for programming ( such as reading &amp; CD ; ) to configure .
opens the main entry dialog of &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; with different card cards ( like Encoder , to set the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , coding and compression ratios and helps you choose the right co@@ di@@ ers .
if no audio information is lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is required . apart from FLA@@ C , there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; Monkey &apos; which may be available for this distribution . dis@@ advantages are low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats , the information caused by data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG are the most common . OGG may today have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences will produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ Not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still supplied with most distri@@ butions free but there are open license questions
+ high up to very high sound quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to OGG slightly lower quality for lower bit@@ rates .
OGG - when only music is to be heard from one computer or computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG player devices is present .
MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo systems . today - beginning 2009 - these devices usually support the MP3 format .
a short list with parameters to audio quality and resulting compression ratios for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting provides good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = This setting was usually sufficient for most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for stereo audio systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 up to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate of about 5.5 . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for stereo audio systems with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate around 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a tit@@ els . good enjo@@ yment for music from yo@@ ungst@@ ers , portable devices and auto @-@ travel systems . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting is over@@ drive for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolutely highest quality without feedback on the file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information provided by the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / needed / used with &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; and the code reader to create folder and file names and the features of music files .
in connection with Ko@@ di@@ er@@ programs , there are often a combination of program settings for the co@@ di@@ ers and these parameters here . the manual or help to the Ko@@ di@@ ers explain the switches for these programs .
for example to add the &amp; CD ; titles are to be encoded when MP@@ 3s with l@@ ame has to add l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; the result looks as follows : &apos; -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; parameters , which can be used ( = button name in the assistant ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database , in which the audio CDs can be up@@ loaded , so that all others can download this information instead of itself in the computer : &amp; CD ; titles , artists , names of the pieces &amp; etc . , not by the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal but I ( An@@ m of the U@@ e@@ ber@@ ster ) is not attor@@ ney . however , no one can extract the information without the &amp; CD ; more or less valuable , so the artist cannot be added to the music company . all information can be found in a um@@ mel by a &amp; CD ; business , physically or virtu@@ ell .
in &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is active to select a check box ( sending an address ) . in this type of configuration , it seems , the email address is not used when calling the data from the server ( This may only know the programmer that has the code . )
there are in many countries copies of the main database . if &amp; Audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator is used to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the geographical location of the next mirror server will be used . this saves bandwidth in the network and resem@@ bles the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org provides a current list of mirror attach@@ ments for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the entire database can be downloaded or ( usually issued monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; saved in WAV files on my computer ?
there is rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wanted to be more precise , searching in source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; please note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must be first installed first if this is not done .
to store the util@@ ized WAV files , the coding can be selected for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ free comp@@ ressing for audio data ) to register the codi@@ le . other co@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the coding package must be installed from the appropriate Linux distribution before the codi@@ erer can be used . this is also necessary for the pre@@ defined co@@ di@@ ers . more information about Ko@@ di@@ erer are in the chapter cat@@ erer .
after installing a codi@@ le , further information on his switch can be obtained through the input of a command -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . it must be replaced by the name of the installed Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers .
that can have many causes . check the device of the device model of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and readers of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , FLA@@ C &amp; etc . ) are installed . try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could indicate what is wrong .
check if you do not want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the case of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this will be how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , all understood but are not somehow to do something ? well , no problem , follow this step by step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas , which will make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , all recorded and our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; to use MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 sample ( tags ) .
it must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found as it is not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files what you can do of course .
please ensure that the directory / usr / share / cd set , and that you have write permission to it ( eg . copy you to copy with the quer@@ or anything ) .
the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; something which is thought to be done only once and
the second section describes the way to read out a &amp; CD ; what must be repeated for each out &amp; CD ; it must be repeated .
here we determine the used co@@ di@@ ers to compression music ( l@@ ame ) and the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 up to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are la@@ zy to use the program to use the fre@@ ed@@ b and download the data from the internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably change it very likely to read out any &amp; CD ; if once the matching settings are found .
the device designation is handed over to the reader program to read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces can be read .
frequently , / dev / c@@ drom a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this is not working or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive can also be used , if the disk with other programs can also be accessed using other programs , the device records for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
map Card General settings . here you can do not much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything becomes so bel@@ low as shown in screen photo .
only for in@@ complete information , please note that you will be informed when information about sample files ( tags ) are missing .
the card card CD ; Settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and leave the &amp; CD ; data automatically via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected during reading &amp; CD ; it can be connected to the Internet to access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection field is sim@@ pler , a &amp; CD ; entry found , starts immediately to read out &amp; CD ; this can be easily changed with the database entry and the resulting directory name / fil@@ en@@ ame or day entries , you can change easily and the ID3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , dem &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , if you want to enter everything manually , you can use the selection areas and fre@@ ed@@ b . however , this is more than 620 MB large , but you can use it twice if you want to use fre@@ ed@@ b in the offline mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card card .
CD@@ DB is for us fre@@ ed@@ b . these are settings for the data request , for the retri@@ eval of the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server on the Internet . how knows the system that data can get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . set everything as shown in screen photo .
mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and look at a mirror server in your way . on this way , the load will be distributed between the machines . this setting is however the first attempt to work .
both work equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls will boot the protocol 88@@ 80 standard , there is perhaps more luck with the protocol 80 because the &amp; HTTP ; Protocol is usually open to surf the internet .
in this example , we want no &amp; CD ; data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . the first check box should be enough .
simply take the settings of screen photo . ( make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer )
number of simultaneous pieces : exc@@ use , there is a reason why more than one at the same time when using an existing drive ? parall@@ el@@ reading and en@@ code ? the author knows it not , therefore just try .
CD ; after reading the last piece : cross this to the &amp; CD ; throw out at the end of the process .
custom file for temporary files : if you can cross this check@@ box , then the path / folders can be saved in which WAV files can be stored . if the box is not crossed , the files will not be checked in the private folder , if you don &apos;t forget this folder when you want to create something with the WAV files .
all such as it is on the screen photo . the command is somewhat long , under circumstances it must be bl@@ otted to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3s . as previously mentioned , it is sufficient for very good audio quality , even for very good stereo set stereo systems . the resulting rate factor is 6.3 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . it &apos;s a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restriction of the creation of tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1st &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can be used when needed . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the complete path ) and output file ( including the complete path ) .
use the rest as in screen photo . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneously to co@@ sting WAV files : when a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than a WAV file at the same time .
this is , we have just completed the basic setup of &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; this configuration will be used as standard for each read of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organis@@ ational structure of your music , you will never need to change it again .
in this section it is described as the process of reading the &amp; CD ; we will create MP3 files . first , we are being organized on the internet , as we are convenient to pick up and the &amp; CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . the process of which is described in this section must be repeated for each output &amp; CD ;
since we are a &amp; CD ; they are not included in fre@@ ed@@ b , look at the screen photos a little different than the data for a &amp; CD ; so you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually , instead of retri@@ eve it from the internet . comments are displayed on the differences .
don &apos;t try the &amp; CD ; this example is to find . it is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author &apos;s manual .
if this is not done , now the &amp; CD is now being defined in the drive that has been defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in screen photo . this only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD , could be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , then check in the section questions and answers to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD will be picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already completed and also the name of the artist and the album is indicated .
for the case there is more than an entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window embedded , and you can select the database entry , which will fit your opinion best to your &amp; CD ;
if you do not have the check box for automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; Settings in dialog for Settings ) , you can also manually fill out this manually by selecting the first button in tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have any local database , you will need to collect the data from the internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
E 1.2 Step 2 : the CD Editor - Input of the CD data and song of the first unit
type the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the unit in the first line of the input field &apos; actu@@ ator &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
the artist does not have to be entered in the input field &apos; actu@@ ator title &apos; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower commentary box can be used for the single comments of ini@@ di@@ ers per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments which are common to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eve of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to review the content of the CD @-@ Ed@@ itors ( e.g. all words with grand@@ letters or not ... ) but also to check if there are any un@@ wanted remarks .
note : in this example , we use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; maximum allowed . this option is set on the tab code settings ; take a look at the section &apos; basic settings &apos; .
you can change the day information of the generated files later with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all co@@ di@@ ers or file formats . see the coefficient for coding to obtain more information .
simply select an entry , which is obvious to the style of the created CD ; in this example , this is not important because we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; data from fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example can be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; come back to the main window . click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD @-@ Ed@@ itors appears and you will see that the fields for the album has already been recorded with the entered data , which we have listed for the first piece of data . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current denom@@ ination . simply select the titles of the piece to any case and other information you wish .
click the next line in the main window and process you to the same way until you have entered the title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window will not appear when you have downloaded the data from fre@@ ed@@ b . you have already been sorted into one of these categories in the database .
it is the third knob of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the log list .
note that there is a check sign before each line of a piece . only the titles are selected to choose one or out . make sure that all pieces are selected , or check the button All pieces select at the bottom edge of the screen to choose all pieces at one time .
if the click on the button selection starts , this window appears to confirm the confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on .
click on the riders orders to switch on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is currently read on the hard disk . the status of the program will be displayed in the lower part of the window at the bottom part of the window .
you can see this error message if you are trying to work with a codi@@ erer you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully coded with a red &apos;@@ X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the tmp file and target folders are not what we have entered here in the example . did you checked if you have a write access to the folder for temporary files and target folders ? ; - )
now it &apos;s clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : mission 4 is the encoding of pieces 1 into the format MP3 . so you can read and en@@ code parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program does not have any configuration settings to read this behaviour . the only thing that seems to read and codi@@ fied the result is un@@ clear . the used calcul@@ ator with a AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and en@@ code ( however two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read , while another piece is coded , and a third order in the qu@@ eu@@ e of the body is coded . after the last piece is coded , a little window will be embedded with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; you will need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x or 4.x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG , you need the coding of your choice .
&amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is now available within the &amp; k@@ de ; CV@@ S , as part of the k@@ dem@@ ul@@ ti@@ media @-@ package . however , you can download an anonymous copy , as a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ packages . if you read this , you probably have done it ...
this section is addressed to individuals who comp@@ ile the source files and are not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are searching for assistance how the program can be adjusted to your needs if it runs once , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls many different programs , has many variants of settings . best read the step by step example to get the options and settings . it shows screen photos of the different card cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , always read on ? even if only the help menu click on the initial start of the program , without any reference point as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
wor@@ um it goes ? who reads this , probably already the program started . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author can &apos;t stop this manual . it is thought as the first version for a guide to &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; it is thought to do . at least only after contact with the author . and if you read this section , he has let this section and therefore agree with this suggest@@ ion .
strange when it managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need this information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ aoke player of &amp; k@@ de ; in addition to others he did not have a real @-@ time graphic and kar@@ aoke @-@ show templates with texts , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ not@@ ch ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ asound project driver that is required for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; K@@ mid ; shows the image on the screen with changing color , so that it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical display of activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can go to &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from one &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows to checkout .
supports both existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( son@@ g@@ ings or text gra@@ dients ) . K@@ Mid controls automatically the used procedure .
seat support . when you finish &amp; k@@ de ; during the player &apos;s finish , K@@ Mid starts again with the same song once again .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P drivers and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can open ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , which allows you to select the desired song .
you can also send a file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows in the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window will drop . this also works with several songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and confirm the button shut@@ ters in the tool@@ bar , select the entry exit from the menu piece or check the Le@@ ert@@ aste .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts when you go to the &amp; k@@ mid &apos; window . ( with several pieces they are added to a collection and then play one another . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece play , you can jump on any spot by using the middle mouse button and drive with the knob and drive .
if you find out that a song is too fast or slowly off , you can click on the left and right of the speed display and then change the speed speed . to get the original speed , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the Le@@ ert@@ aste has two tasks : if a piece is played , a pressure on the button break or select the menu entry break in the menu , so interrup@@ ts the playback . if no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback will start .
lyrics can be stored on two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use Tex@@ ts , others use lyrics and other both . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust what events will be determined and even better : the event type is automatically determined , so that you can manually adjust the kar@@ aoke text , but you still have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other kind .
if you want to set a event type , select from the menu settings the entries text gra@@ dients or for@@ g@@ ings . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summar@@ ise . these are the series to play in this section as you can efficiently use collections .
in order to win a collection , open the collection manager . these can be found in the menu collection below the point . click on New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by copying them on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs like the original .
if you have more than a collection , you can set the desired information about the collection manager .
in the temporary collection all songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection will not be saved . consider that if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , she must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the button . there is again the file dialog , which you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on the setup of automatic adding to the collection .
when automatic add to the collection is enabled , a piece when opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) is automatically added to the active collection .
when automatic add to the collection , it is activated , when opening a piece the temporary collection , then it will be added to open pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click on Remove .
you can select the sequence where the songs can be played . if you select the row after the sub@@ menu of the menu window , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you add songs or remove any random order in the menu , the sequence will be defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to jump a song , select the button next song , the entry next song from the menu or press the arrow on the right .
to jump back a song back to jump , select the button 2 piece , the entry would previous piece from the menu or press the arrow on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click on the button .
the temporary collection can &apos;t be deleted . however , this doesn &apos;t matter if it is not saved by &amp; k@@ mid ; it is not saved .
this is necessary to syn@@ thesizer that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events is translated into events that under@@ stands the syn@@ thesizer .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the Change patch to B@@ right piano in events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type and thus always a trumpet sound , if originally a piano should play .
if you have just a sound card you don &apos;t need MIDI map because all sound@@ cards GM are compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and CIS cards , FM and so on ) .
there is no programs to create MIDI @-@ maps . you need to process the appropriate file from hand ( with your favourite d@@ itor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that saves all necessary modifications to play one piece .
each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section , which may appear as often as desired . pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is that every appearance has a different text ID ( see below ) .
source P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D define KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; name of Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D define KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; A further Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D DE@@ CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D options ... EN@@ D
you see that it is needed to show that a section starts ( except for options ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail to which I have in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not General MIDI @-@ compatible .
in this section it is specified as the patches from General MIDI to your specific keyboard are shown . the general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the equ@@ alling is igno@@ red . it is believed that the GM will not change in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and also no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional all @-@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to create all sounds which supports this instrument ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to a def@@ ensive effect . with this , you can also bear the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so , if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 ( def@@ ensive net ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of what sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the concept Drum patch of the patch is meant , with each tone a different per@@ cus@@ sion@@ ing instrument ( drum , bas@@ ins , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc . ) and not the one , with the tone the pitch of the always same drum means ( as some keyboards own ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section is used to specify such as sounds at a certain channel or instrument . the use is :
as the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section is the order of lines very important , as their presence . you need to create 128 entries .
you can define multiple Ke@@ ym@@ aps for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use various names in the first line .
Ke@@ ym@@ aps are mainly used to form tones on the percussion channel . check out as an example the supplied Ke@@ ym@@ aps .
this section can be used to convert some channels to others . if you want to exchange the first and second channel , you can simply do this easily in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are useful for keyboards which have per@@ kus@@ sion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern :
n is the channel that is listed on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map must be used in the file . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be igno@@ red , try to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x is used .
the For@@ ce@@ patch option can be useful for example to use the per@@ cus@@ sion@@ ist patch on the per@@ cus@@ sions channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ ratio can be multiplied in which ratio pitch Ben@@ der events will be multiplied by the value n , this with the formula n * ( r / 4096 ) is converted and then only for@@ warded . the value 4096 is used to be installed in the map file in the Map @-@ file .
this setting is needed because GM is needed to play a pitch Ben@@ der event with the value 4096 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , however , some Key@@ boards get up to one octave higher . in order to find the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , just open the dialog for MIDI Settings . these can be found in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI Settings
the channel view is a window with all the cl@@ avi@@ es ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these keyboards you can see which sounds are just played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you have changed one instrument . if you have an instrument change , the button is no longer green but red , to display that no more the original instrument is used .
the channel view ( until now ) has two different views to display the played tones . view the view@@ point settings below the Point channel view : settings
the Tempo @-@ LCD shows the speed that a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the speed of a song . if you find such a song be too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows to the left and right from the LCD .
a file containing MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece must be played . it also contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . thus , the same MIDI file can lead to very different results , the same as two different musicians can play the same notes on very different ways .
well , I can &apos;t be able to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but with a good syn@@ thesizer you need a similar sound quality . in addition , you can also change a similar sound quality . in addition to a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything .
that may happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; it happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support , you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos; s home )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually .
agree to support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . just open the folder that you want to add into &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files from , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
simply dis@@ able the adjustment of automatic add to the collection . otherwise the files are added to temporary collection .
you can see the arrow button on the left from Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the standard temp@@ o you can click on the LCD .
I have seen on a &amp; mixed lot ; -@@ windows with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file , or if I want to play a file , merely go into the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to change and drag the file into the window by &amp; k@@ mid .
if you want to listen to a file quickly , without having to add to a collection , turn off the adjustment of automatic add to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. please do not only want to play the first file . so , adjust the setup automatic add to the collection and open a temporary collection , then exactly these a MIDI file .
then un@@ lock the B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid version and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . all many thanks ! when I see this songs you hear or see the postcard , animated me further on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; K@@ mid ; has been written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; at the moment I &apos;m not much free time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit time for my hob@@ bies . as hob@@ bies , I try to collect MIDI files , music make music and phr@@ ases .
if you want to know where you want to download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you simply want to make me happy , send me an e @-@ mail : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de.@@ org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really do a huge anticip@@ ation , if you send me a postcard from your home or a MID@@ I@@ - / kar@@ aoke file of a local group . if you want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file , you should contact me if you have a MIDI file , but you might have to contact me as I might have the file .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; it is completely written in my free time and I would like to make money a lot of money . I therefore would like that I only want to score users , because / when I get feedback from users ( postcards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - Keep the fault that the pitch is high at AW@@ E @-@ cards .
my thanks to Jose L@@ us San@@ chez for testing the G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Magnus pepper , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Joachim Cor@@ des and everyone who sent me a patch , an error message or also sent a suppor@@ tive e @-@ mail .
and of course , my thanks also applies all these outstanding musicians in the net that give us these wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ mid &apos; can be found on his website , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can see the development , look for information and pictures . you can also find links to sites with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc .
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer because the sound quality depends on your sound card . it is not the same if you use a FM device or AW@@ E card .
if you have no sound card , you have to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DEM@@ O _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it runs when you would have a sound card , except that you can &apos;t listen to music .
if any problems occur , please contact the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mail@@ ing@@ lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is needed to play video files from the player or phon@@ on supported formats , as well as to play DVD s , VCD or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ endix ; was not yet finished &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website to new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user Mail@@ ing list .
the application window is made of called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . alternatively , there is a window with the playlist . and finally there is a information window that will only be displayed when information is recovered .
it is possible to specify the preferred connections below the menu . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the Category Dau@@ erh@@ ly playlist .
of course you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hier@@ arch@@ est@@ u@@ fe . if you copy an entry , its group and all its sub@@ sets to the current category copies and playback starts with the requested entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and continuous playlist , can also be changed by direct editing of XML Configuration files . of course , the various files can be changed , but also by application itself . simply click on a name of a category cli@@ cks , on the menu click here and as next processing mode . by clicking a sub @-@ group , only the XML content will be shown this part .
after changing XML files , the menu must be chosen with playlist , or select either the processing mode or select another category .
all changes are lost if the processing mode is selected or another group is selected without the playlist .
following the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation when starting and loading can be de@@ activated by editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ c and change from &#91; General option &#93; No in@@ tro = 0 ob@@ ab option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to activate one other animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player , the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / k@@ m@@ player / st@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation at the starting point doesn &apos;t need to be short , it will automatically termin@@ ate through the opening of another source . this would be anno@@ ying with the end @-@ animation , but the user can therefore end the application a second time .
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the ads of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; and lt ; / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; Me@@ et &quot; and lt ; / ; / ; / ; / ; / ; / ; / ; In the spring package of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; are in the directory tests / some examples of S@@ MIL the of &amp; k@@ m@@ player .
there is a rider for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here the path of the player and the inter@@ space size of the data can be adjusted from the network and other things .
another tool for trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar by k@@ m@@ player . here &apos;s the output of m@@ player .
there is no rider for this playback at the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured by manual loading of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ c . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec Mozilla .
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be played the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
so the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , you need to play &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as a service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash flash in the insertion dialog file assignment of K@@ DE .
the con@@ quer@@ or or k@@ m@@ player ; is available in a console application and after error messages concerning the loading of the browser module library to browse . if no error occur , the back@@ end output is within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
this is always an appropriate back@@ end for a certain M@@ ime type ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ c . for example , phon@@ on all og@@ g files are used :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play TV cards , either by using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) , which can be configured to use the device and the TV channels . it can be used manually from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Data recorder ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player is the dialog for Settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be sure to be selected from which one is selected ( e.g. , it is PAL for Western Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DVB in it .
since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player is only able to work X@@ Video ( probably this type of play@@ time video devices under Linux can also work only on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . for this reason , the video for@@ lin@@ ux extension refers to the X server . for the XFree86 server you need to include the following in his configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .

are there information as I can make my CD@@ ROM drive , if I play from it ( not by the VCD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ e 8 / dev / c@@ drom is as a user root with the integration of the device . it is absolutely sure to make sure / dev / c@@ drom on the CD@@ ROM drive .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interface and network support and is needed to comp@@ ile up &amp; c@@ ile .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional copy application . under Unix systems probably will probably return to the package &amp; tex@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be used in the used &amp; lin@@ ux distribution . for installation , documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD can be used .
the &amp; c@@ ile ; project includes some already compiled packages of &amp; c@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow an easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the c@@ ile ; -@@ website .
this manual is for everyone - independent of your experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; c@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ;
advanced users must probably hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions regarding documentation . is the support to this project or documentation , the contact should be made via the c@@ ile ; -@@ website .
any questions about or when comp@@ ile by &amp; c@@ ile ; on or will be desired , this should be addressed to the ma@@ iling list c@@ ile @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; c@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ environment for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ functions in a graphical user interface and within this one simple , direct and customized access within the source text as well as conversion tools for these . lock@@ able , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and his ways to experience the manual should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; c@@ ile ; users can start directly with reading the chapter of Works with the Editor &amp; Kate .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the correct per@@ si@@ bilities : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . you can use a La@@ o ( English l@@ ay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros can also be used . a less sophisticated but more realistic show that it is derived from the name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
here only a good view to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given it , it is not the ultimate book . in order to rule &amp; lat@@ ex ; right there should rule well @-@ proof , e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; Lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r .
just as other sign@@ alling languages includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; a introduction , with which the gener@@ alized features such as paper format , side number@@ ing and text of the text will be specified as well as a request with the command \ \ Beg@@ in { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ End { document } .
the high @-@ level assistant of &amp; c@@ ile ; is an important feature for the quick creation of a document in &amp; c@@ ile ; the selection of the assistant ( men@@ Ã ¼ ) offers some passages for creating the document . there are also some examples related to the document @-@ related settings .
document classes : hereby , the type of creating document must be used : articles ( article ) , book &#91; report &#93; , letter &#91; report &#93; , published ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ .7 &#93; , published ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , published ( DIN ) &#91; scan &#93; , slides &#91; Prosp@@ er &#93; or custom .
coding : this will default the encoding of the system . modern systems are increasingly used to use UTF @-@ 8 encoding than standard . best , UTF @-@ 8x encoding ( for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
this list includes the most commonly used packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration they are only balanced in the check box .
articles ( DIN ) , vol . ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the Docum@@ entation classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with the German DIN regulations ) . you should always find the creation of German texts .
new users can now worry not wor@@ ries . it is only a short description of functions and more detailed information are given in the section .
&amp; C@@ ile ; offers - as well as other source editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . it is possible to do some time problems with a modest appearance of output file . however , it will be noticed by the modest appearance of output file . however , it will be saved by the high@@ lighting time and visitors .
with the automatic adjustment of environments ( e.g. \ \ Beg@@ in { command } ) of &amp; c@@ ile ; automatically creates a space ( for input of the text ) and the added line to the close parts of the command ( e.g. \ \ \ &apos; command } ) . this function can be de@@ activated in the menu settings ; configure ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are de@@ activated .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; encourage the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the most important element and sub@@ lime the lower element ) :
at view of the document in the structural view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click on it .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful once a DVI ; file &#91; ger@@ many un@@ ab@@ h@@ y file ( English D e V ice I n@@ oses File ) &#93; created , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI ; viewing on the appropriate line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format document and also other information about the written document type &amp; tex ; or lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools available to view , conversion and printing from DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and devices .
when using R@@ Ã ¼ inch search , the elements of the DVI ; file is clicked on a element in the DVI ; -@@ file is spec@@ kl@@ ed , the exact opposite is the exact opposite . once on a section in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is clicked on the corresponding place in the DVI ; viewing viewer .
Master @-@ Document : this function is used in work with several files . with a master document the work is simplified with other in@@ bound .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project project can be set up project settings .
rapid construction : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result will be automatically displayed ( unless there are no error in the source code ) .
file access : in this mode the DVI ; -@@ file is displayed at the n@@ der@@ un@@ gen@@ â s , and there is no call by &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; according to the rapid construction .
in consideration of the processing tool bar the three gro@@ ove selection should be developed for the fast entry of common elements in the document . the first selection field is suitable for rapid breakdown of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... the ver@@ itable &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for the sub@@ division :
the selection box Show other is for inser@@ ting articles such as keywords , joints , notes or wise . the available mut@@ ations are :
name : this command is written by a section for a section , a picture or different element .
regarding : is used for reference to a specified name ( selecting a selection box ) .
when using quote is displayed a selection list with literary entries . for &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are only necessary if the file is necessary to a project . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; -@@ files can also be written in &amp; c@@ ile ; files are written by hand .
the last selection box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¨ e is used for defin@@ ing the font names . it is the main text for the main text , the joints are specified , etc . there are the following font names to include :
at the calling of &amp; k@@ ile ; two selection lists are available : 1 . the assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document type and conclusion of the settings . 2 . the document can be written by reason .
the brackets according to the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ aries contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the font color . the font is not set at the beginning , this can also be seen in the text .
as soon as the above source code was entered the &amp; lat@@ ex file ; the easiest way is to be compiled . the easiest way is to use the Men@@ Ã ¼ s Building or the button quick construction .
the source code must be stored before the compilation . &amp; c@@ ile ; for storing the storage .
the compilation of the document must be sought after the errors in the protocol . when using quick construction , &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the protocol also should be considered .
an environment ( English ) is a text that will be treated differently than the remaining document . for example , a report with the font is made 12 . the command \ \ Beg@@ in { environment } , \ \ \ and \ \ End { Premature Ejaculation } shall be a copy of the font only within the surrounding area . ( in English ) .
the changes will only be paid within the environment ( from \ \ Beg@@ in { environment } to \ \ End { environment } ) . there is no decision type ( number ) for changes in the environment within a environment .
there are many varieties available to read the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . it is possible for example , certain fonts , l@@ ashing pressure , sub @-@ sub@@ missions , etc . these commands are either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ Beg@@ in { em@@ ph } : this command is for short @-@ intensive and is as long as long until it is closed with a \ \ End { em@@ ph } or another environment . a single word in a set can be displayed using \ \ em@@ ph { word } .
\ \ Qu@@ ote : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ Beg@@ in { Qu@@ ote } and ends with \ \ End { Qu@@ ote } .
after writing the source text by &amp; lat@@ ex ; a step @-@ step instruction for creating a document will follow in &amp; styles .
as soon as the assistant was entered a bit text , a few adjustments were fulfilled for the better read@@ ability of the document . these should be a quote , a few places in the fat and spa printing and a po@@ em to the application to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , by editor @-@ View or C@@ tr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( in the internal view ) . in an external viewer , its window must be closed .
once the DVI ; file created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . easy to try and fun .
DVI ; is a balanced file format ( English D e V ice I n@@ oses ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output like printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF transformer or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file the same steps as for creating the document must be displayed ( see ) . in the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , then the document can be printed ( if the printer is correctly set ) .
the tool@@ bar enables the conversion of DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; file created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code can be created , the conversion can begin in any other formats using the buttons in the tool@@ bar .
the preliminary search for the direct jump from the editor to the da@@ isy position within the DVI ; -@@ file .
&amp; c@@ ile ; offers a corresponding adjustment for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ binding files . for this purpose only Modern will be able to set up a ... Tools construction .
to search for the anticip@@ ation , the mouse poin@@ ter can be positioned in a line of the source text and can be cli@@ pped on stock search . the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI ; viewing takes place then .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; comes with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document by &amp; k@@ ile ; read and clari@@ fication ; as text editor shall be specified as text editor ... editor )
should the use of quick construction of the &amp; DVI ; viewing is not possible , an error can be found . if there is an error , this will appear in the log file or in the message window .
the protocol file nar@@ row@@ ns the error source in the source code . the log file is always used to view the error . in order to view the faul@@ ty line , the protocol has to be clicked on the error in the log @-@ regulation , and jumps to the incorrect line .
once on the respective knob in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to choose from the appropriate template for the document . the pre @-@ set mix@@ es are :
in selecting from empty document , a document can either be written either by reason or the assistant to the quick creation of a new document . further information is included in the section .
H@@ Ã ¤ u@@ tively user of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be stored in &amp; c@@ ile ; created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , it needs to be created either a existing &amp; tex ; - / Lat@@ ex ; -@@ file created or create a new file . &amp; c@@ ile ; can create a new template using an existing document and selection of file template from document ... create .
when creating a new document from a template using the file , some strings can be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables will be set in Settings ... settings General .
when creating your own presentation , it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by what variables are :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CLASS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string is replaced by entering the documentation class . typically , it will be used as follows : \ \ docum@@ ent@@ aries &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CLASS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the Assistant and the associated entry into the editor . once the document has been prepared for the following steps :
when creating a new document , the own template can be selected instead of default .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files will be created . a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and will be displayed below the steps below .
&amp; Kate ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers with the read@@ iness of reading and high@@ lighting of many different types of text files ( including also &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; Kate ; can be made out directly in the menu .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; the hand@@ book of Kate will be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; users can start directly with reading the chapter of Works with the Editor &amp; Kate .
&amp; c@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ command conference , which can be called via the Men@@ Ã ¼ &quot; La@@ Te@@ X reference system . you will have an evaluation description of almost all commands that are in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use can be found and their syntax .
a double @-@ click with selected C@@ tr@@ l button to do the &amp; tex ; that means that , in this way , click on \ \ par \ \ \ big@@ ski@@ p only \ \ par @-@ balanced .
when pulling the text with straight left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow keys , you can find out parts of the source text in the editors window .
&amp; c@@ ile ; has the possibility to browse the various types of source texts and this . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color .
many assist@@ ants can be enclosed . this is an own kind of book@@ marks within the text . the men@@ Ã ¼ ge be@@ zel give the jump to the most important or last j@@ umping mark . this j@@ umping stamp will also be highlighted , so that they will automatically acquire a character on the first input of a character .
the work is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as &amp; c@@ ile ; . although &amp; Kate ; important functions for the writing of a &amp; lat@@ ex ; source codes for their selection . among them are listed below are the following commands to include text code :
there is a complete sub@@ section ( such as lines that contain on both sides a blank line ) . this extended meaning has been added to the tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source text . the only visible thing in &amp; c@@ ile ; is that the space is separated by two empty lines .
the word below the current cur@@ sor position . this selection has also a expanded meaning because this command is also &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands with a lot of rooms ( \ \ ) and an enclosed star ( * ) at the end .
for example a part of the document can be removed from this first . &amp; Kate ; offers the key figure C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; c@@ ile ; offers you own commands for a faster sensitivity . under processing , the following commands are included in the text :
remov@@ es a complete sub@@ section . the definition for a sub@@ section in &amp; c@@ ile ; is included in the description of processing w@@ ells .
it was already clear that environments is a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; that &apos;s why it offers &amp; c@@ ile ; for additional commands in the area for a great work with &amp; lat@@ ex ;
with this command is spec@@ kl@@ ed to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the surrounding area .
by the end of current environments ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command of the surrounding area .
if the cur@@ sor before or within the command \ \ Beg@@ in { surroundings } is located at the end of the environment ( or vice vers@@ a ) .
when entering a lot of el@@ ong@@ ated ambient commands , this command can be lost quickly . this command was close to the most recent environment , so that the scra@@ pped environment structure is not sc@@ ared .
&amp; c@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by brackets { ... } . among the work te@@ X group are some important commands that correspond to those in the environment .
with this command , the command is to start at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the guesthouse .
with this command , the command is inj@@ ected at the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the attached cl@@ adding .
if the cur@@ sor before or behind the soft vel@@ cro of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # is , will be spec@@ kl@@ ed to the other end of the group ( or vice vers@@ a ) .
when entering a lot of welded , groups brackets can be lost rapidly . this command was close to the most recent group , so that the scra@@ pped structure of &amp; tex ; groups does not tum@@ ble .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple beginnings as used for the purpose is used in &amp; c@@ ile ; the character is used for two simple beginnings . also for the processing of the beginnings is used . &amp; c@@ ile ; knows this case and for two close @-@ ups for &amp; lat@@ ex ; a .
this automatic entry into double conversion can be used under Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X and turn off .
there is also lots of specific settings ( such as n@@ oses or French ) and therefore German or French art signs . there are also many other languages available .
when Dr@@ inks of Shift ; En@@ cryp@@ tic is for a smart line breaks . if the current position is located within a lists -@@ environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , the current position within a range of lists ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) is available , not just a line break but also the command \ \ item .
close to a tables -@@ environment , the current line with \ \ \ \ using an attached Z@@ eil@@ en@@ um@@ b off .
even better - &amp; c@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support vo@@ iced &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom @-@ defined environments . these can be added under Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X .
some users can arrange the columns in tables -@@ environments and all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) is trying to ad@@ mon@@ ish this . although this tab@@ ulator will not be the da@@ isy table , for example , for some inter@@ space for the columns position of the current tab@@ ul@@ ators .
although &amp; Kate ; already a good source code system has been added , this in &amp; c@@ ile ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) , these modes are available for automatic feeding systems . all these modes can be implemented for different work settings under settings can be adjusted ...
when beginning a new environment using the command \ \ Beg@@ in { environment } will be added &amp; c@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ End { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the edges , the last letter of input is removed , and you can also sc@@ roll down the complete list . on the other hand , the list may also be reduced by entering a further letters .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are available for selection of a command . alternatively , alternatively from &amp; k@@ ile ; also jump stamps can be found , so that a simply jump to these positions by means of j@@ umping j@@ umping stamp is possible and the desired parameters will be applied .
under Settings k@@ ile ; configure ... cold ; Ver@@ i@@ bility lists for these lists can be made . there &apos;s various sor@@ ts lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as knowledge of general language used to be balanced .
the command mode is non @-@ conscious of environments you don &apos;t have a few letters with \ \ Beg@@ in . on the other hand , the environments are often used with environmental protection . on the other hand , the environments are often used so often that &amp; c@@ ile ; a special mode for the reliability of the environment .
when rest@@ oring the final mode , the orders will automatically be applied to the reserved environment or the key diagram Alt + Shift . then , the command will automatically be frozen and it appears \ \ Beg@@ in { . afterwards , the environment can be continued on the sim@@ pl@@ est way and can be completed by pressing the input .
after this is fully completed , the environment will automatically be closed automatically . once &amp; c@@ ile ; recogni@@ zes that it is a first \ \ item command , it is still a first \ \ item command .
under Settings k@@ ile ; configure ... c@@ ile ; complete settings of these lists can be carried out . this mode uses the list of adjustment mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; C@@ ile ; support custom lists of distances , which are immediately replaced by l@@ ent character strings . as an example of a copy list , the file is ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , which is included in the example of the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
for example , the letter L entered and the word is fully derived from delay mode or the key figure C@@ tr@@ l + Alt Le@@ ert@@ aste , the letter L will be replaced by the character \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
coar@@ se W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ b@@ Ã ¼ chers are not helpful . however , many whales were written in a document more than once . that &apos;s it offers &amp; c@@ ile ; all rights reserved for all already written documents .
this mode can be set in the menu settings ... can be scre@@ ened . here , the sw@@ elling value for the display can be set out .

the graphic art shows the entry of graphics as simple as possible . to the view of the basics in the graphics formats , sections and observ@@ ations are considered .
PS files are not as known as PDF files , but provide an excellent basis for current changes and new orders of pages . the PDF output is new , so the pages can be arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools can be converted to a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf .
to summar@@ ize the result of the work , you need to comp@@ ile the source code . all construction tools are group@@ ed in the men@@ Ã ¼ s create compilation , creation and create view .
for the compilation of the source for viewer , such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used by pressing Alt ; 3 , by means of Alt ; 4 the DVI ; -@@ file converted into a PS file and can be viewed using Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using a command quick construction , a viewer is normally called after comp@@ ile . should not be used to enter a new window , each time becomes a new window .
a new project will be asked about the project new project .... This is the following information for the project :

the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; quantitative , have very much to do with &amp; quantitative . therefore , the plug @-@ in system is very powerful . you can &apos;t wait until someone used the desired in &amp; quantitative . you can see the plug@@ ins in a large number of &amp; GUI ; more elements can be used below .
to install a plug@@ in or a single part , we start with the menu plug @-@ in . so the following dialog will be opened :
this dialog allows you to manage all the plug @-@ ins and add new features . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding a plug @-@ ins without a storage location &amp; quantitative , this path to search of the plug @-@ ins .
often in a project several people work together in a kind of hier@@ arch@@ ical relationship with each other . &amp; quantitative policy ; supports the specification of Team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves to clear identification .
a member can have several roles in the project , as well as the project leader , as well as Sub@@ project manager .
the user can look out from the list of Team members , who he is . this happens by taking the team member from the list and button S@@ etze than ex@@ presses . the currently selected member ( their identification ) will be published after you are : text .
top names and attitude of your own identity are important for news and notes . see for further information on ann@@ ot@@ ations .
in addition to an overview of her team , there is another advantage through the members of the team : it can be a event for information to the team manager if something specific happens . see in for further information .
event actions are actions which will be executed if a bit any particular might be done in the project . an example would be the recording of public and closing of the project , if a file is secured , or the sending of a message if a file is stored into CV@@ S , as soon as she is added to the project &amp; etc .
on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog can be created , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the address selected in the receiver list . the address can be a team or Sub@@ project manager . see in , we@@ i such ladder can be set up .
notes are special comments in documents . they differ from normal commentary by the following :
note is easy . it can be selected either by the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation Key@@ word in a comment area followed by reference ext .
note can be sent to a specific member of the team . in this case the syntax of the entered top name of the team is part of the project leader , role of the project leader Sub@@ project leader According to the enrich@@ ment and sub@@ project managers , the corresponding range or Sub@@ project names should be given , as shown in the examples below .
top names and roll names are independent of large or small sc@@ ents , but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note inv@@ alid .
&amp; quantitative policy ; is a development environment for scripts and form@@ att@@ ing languages supported by D@@ TD @-@ ag@@ nost@@ ic and web@@ based form@@ att@@ ing and script languages supported .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here only about &amp; quantitative att@@ us ; specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set via Settings Quant@@ a ... are called . the dialog covers more than some pages that are treated to each other .
the behaviour of &amp; quantitative information ; related to tags including car rental may be changed . the entries are :
large / small sc@@ oring of tags : large / small sc@@ roll@@ ment of automatically added tags . normal / small sc@@ oring means the tags will be inserted as soon as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / small sc@@ oring of At@@ tri@@ bu@@ cks : large / small sc@@ aling from automatically added attributes . normal great / small sc@@ aling means that attributes are added so inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags automatically include : if attached , the day is optional , for which the end day is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted .
un@@ optional tags automatically include : as above all the tags with the exception of the simple tags .
start and end @-@ day automatically update : if enabled , the corresponding day is changed and vice vers@@ a .
automatic detection of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of ac@@ claimed characters in the appropriate coding during setting .
M@@ ime types : m@@ im@@ et@@ yp@@ es for det@@ ecting different types of files . using the default button , the default settings can be restored .
default encoding : the coding of newly created or in other way as with open file open files ( where encoding the file can be transferred ) . this setting here is out@@ dated from the same in the project characteristics , if a project is loaded .
standard @-@ D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files or for files whose D@@ TD is not detected , but this setting is out@@ dated from the same in the project characteristics , if a project is loaded .
create a backup copy : &amp; quantitative copy ; created regularly backup copy , so that in case of power failure or crash when the next start of the program can be re@@ produced from this backup . this is not the same as storing the file . even for not stored documents , a backup is regularly produced , accordingly to the set time .
the preview and documentation can be presented either in the editors or a separate view ( or documentation in a cart@@ oning ) , which makes it possible to preview the documentation , preview and sources simultaneously .
set the settings on the standard back to the next start is useful if the user interface by changing the MDI modes and and@@ o@@ cken / depending on the views are met . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning messages in the field is to be able to en@@ rol the indication of war@@ nings by a h@@ ack of no more questions .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can also change the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the synchron@@ ization behaviour of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code in shared mode . see the different modes see .
here the par@@ ser and the structural tree can set the figure of the Par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , in details .
in the mouse click on the structural tree , the following action is possible to change the action by clicking on the structural tree with the mouse button .
in the area of structural tree settings the visibility of no@@ des in tree to be opened automatically . empty no@@ des are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups such are those that are not found in the current document .
the range for fixing the ab@@ brevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) which may be divided into working with extensive text . ab@@ brevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be divided for several &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; this means it may be a valid Group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ cl@@ ause termination is something different than in a group valid for Javascript .
the plug@@ ins are done here . plug@@ ins are the third part of the third page that can be re@@ used by each K@@ Part @-@ capable application , the most famous &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug@@ ins must be specified :
address : the path to plug@@ in when it is not at a standard place as $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / lib .
input : this information is transferred to the plug@@ in to the start , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of current file ) or project folder .
component in the &quot; Use @-@ read &quot; mode : check if the plug@@ in is ref@@ using to store the store . only read @-@ read @-@ k@@ Parts is usually the load when this option is not chosen .
check the plug@@ in : is it activated , then test@@ et &amp; quantitative ; if the inserted information is correct . then the storage of the entry will also be available if the plug@@ in at the moment is not available , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; quantitative information ; from version 3.3 , the trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting was completely redesigned . support for the non @-@ built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was discontinued as well as the support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead of its a deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ in concept was implemented , which enables different implem@@ entations about plug@@ ins .
at present , only one plug@@ in is available , support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ quantitative ;
using the deb@@ ug@@ gers for a project begins with the selection of a suitable deb@@ ug@@ ger plug in the project settings . using the button options next to the deb@@ ug@@ ger @-@ plug@@ in selection box , the specific settings can be changed .
if a deb@@ ug@@ ger is enabled , some additional elements appear in the &amp; quantitative user interface ; user interface :
a view that is indicated in the content of super@@ vised variables is usually displayed in the left dock .
a view that all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed below . normally , in the lower dock .
a view that the edition ( like in HTML ) of the deb@@ ug@@ ger is shown . usually in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the deb@@ ug@@ ger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this promotion , the connection to Deb@@ ug@@ ger , if necessary , or it divi@@ des the plug@@ in to Deb@@ ug@@ ger . this promotion will be triggered by default if a project is opened , so that a deb@@ ug@@ ger must not be considered in the normal case .
the counter@@ part to Deb@@ ug@@ ging Session Star@@ te the session . closes the connection to Deb@@ ug@@ ger or termin@@ ate it according to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to initi@@ ate a deb@@ ug request . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to watch the current document . the issue of this requirement will be displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger issue .
the deb@@ ug@@ ger started to start with the execution of the script and information on the super@@ vised variables as well as the currently completed line will continue . if this happens , the execution is continued , the script will start with the request .
points the deb@@ ug@@ ger to start with the execution of the script file , without any information on super@@ vised variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script was given , the execution begins , the execution begins as soon as a requirement is provided .
the deb@@ ug@@ ger leads the next order in the script without entering the functions or include files .
the deb@@ ug@@ ger leads the next order in the script , whereby if possible in functions and include files .
points the deb@@ ug@@ ger to ski@@ p the instruction and go to the next so , than if there is not the current .
opens a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered that will be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variation of variation .
this dialog can be entered a variable or set a new value of a variable .

this chapter describes how to custom@@ ize &amp; quantitative us ; adapt to your needs and how you can help &amp; quantitative .
editing packages ( D@@ T@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; quantitative languages ; used to provide support for Mark@@ up@@ - and scripts , as well as &amp; CSS ; their simplicity and flexibility makes it a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for Web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the script languages or &amp; CSS ; s &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s consist of two file types , the tag languages and the tool@@ bars . day folder include two file types , the text and descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and tag@@ .@@ XML files are contained in a document above the editing window ( above the editing window ) , the text and instructions can be inserted faster than a user .
&amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s can be purchased ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see in for details to conversion .
this document describes how the XML files are created , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , one &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ;
tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the Fe@@ at@@ l@@ alog@@ y , which shows &amp; quantitative information ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ EP ; own tool@@ bar enable a fast insertion of tags in a document without any risk of writing .
tag folder are nothing as a folder . they contain only the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the tag@@ XML files . tag folder carry the name of writing language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the day XML and clear whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible , so other users have a better insight and more information on work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in easier manner .
this is the root element of a day XML document . it can contain only once in one document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but it can only contain any element type above itself .
the type of tags is a script function . when using it , att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the Type Method . there is the name of the class where this method is heard . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attri@@ bute group and the attributes within this tags can be added to each other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text in the dialogue . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ day . that &apos;s an element type element .
this element can only describe a attri@@ bute . this element can be found only once for any attri@@ bute . additionally , it sets the name and type of the attri@@ bute . additionally , it contains additional tags that will describe how this attri@@ bute should be displayed &amp; etc . this is an only element type element .
returns the source code for the attributes on tag editor and in the attri@@ bute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; quantitative and is used to reach the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method@@ ology within &amp; quantitative name is used to achieve the source of data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and a method@@ ology name . the arguments that are handed over to the method . can be empty or % day name % , which means the name of the current tags .
a container day that contains the elements of a list . it can only occur once a attri@@ bute description . it is an only element type element .
the position of the attri@@ bute ex@@ cre@@ tes of a tags within a dialog . this tag can occur once every attri@@ bute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
returns the position and the size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for each field at a dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the defin@@ ite tags . this element is an only element type .
there is a list of elements that end a day . this element is an only element type .
all day XML files must begin with a &amp; XML ; declar@@ ations start with &amp; XML ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ti@@ dy and closed .
spaces influence nothing , but pay attention to &amp; B &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ bar &gt; , and lt ; text &gt; will not be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to review the tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog appears in &amp; quantitative information ; -@@ window to start and check out Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ A . another dialog will appear , whose simple instructions will follow .
this function is currently not available yet . currently , check only when charging the tag@@ XML files in &amp; quantitative .
in the following an example of a family 1 day XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; element of the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ scheme . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this day XML file should be shown .
in the following an example for a functional family 2 tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; transfer@@ able function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this day XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; day &gt;
the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is also quite simple and there is a editor that can be edited by D@@ TD . this may be processed by a list of selectable &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it should be created for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; General &#93; Version = usable for &amp; quantitative ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD . ( - / / W@@ 3C ; / / D@@ TD HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of D@@ TD . ( HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name is used as a Nick@@ name .
a action can set action with Settings ... and click here for New action to the same dialog :
this action can be assigned to this action . by clicking the user button , a key root can be assigned . with K@@ one , the current button is easy to remove .
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be entered in detail in detail and by execution of the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see below .
this is the most powerful shareholder type . using this promotion , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that can change the document or as parts of the document ( or parts of the document ) , even if the fast start dialog or the different See in ... promotions for ( X ) HTML D@@ T@@ EP@@ s .
the first must be the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter . example : SH / home / my@@ home / my@@ Scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scri@@ pt@@ yourself variable in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / Quant@@ a / scripts / Quant@@ a / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable which can be used in the command line :
% f : we replaced the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name .
% pi@@ d : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; quantitative ; process . if by &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; only one instance runs , the text is distributed to the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ COP is used to control &amp; quantitative script .
the parameter for this event , normally the file name of the current document or the path to project file .
in addition to the above method , a script can be obtained from &amp; quantitative . in the selection box , input can be determined what is to be sent to the standard entry . possibilities :
selected text : the selected section of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually done only with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types issue : normal output , based on the standard output file ; error messages can be done with the default output written by which the value is specified by the value box issue :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create a custom tool@@ bar for each group . in the case it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the market .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you have to add promotions and configure the actions .
the parts of this window are rather self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom end of the window starts scanning mode .
fill out all the necessary fields and add them to the matching tool bar .
complete all and if the day attributes has and you plan your use , activate the dialogue &quot; tag , if available , so that a input should be possible when using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is that a ug@@ ly icon . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? we replace it before we have difficulties .
to create a symbol that the action is better , we will use &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; choose from the &amp; delicious , graphics further programs ( or where otherwise it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size .
please note that the created symbol no just helps you to remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ;
with regard to the day that the day is , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . due to the use of green ( green is usually considered loose , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should be sign@@ alized at least , a message to the user will show this symbol no &amp; lt ; start@@ up ; -@@ day in the current document .
after creating the symbol it must be connected to the action . this happens via the menu with Settings ... ( in &amp; quantitative ; ) and selection of the desired action . in addition to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the user button and put them on with other tags if there are , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; quantitative ; -@@ functions to tool@@ bar supplement or it should be shared to a better overview by some separ@@ ator in several groups . open the tool@@ bars a dialog for Settings tool@@ bars . make sure the desired tool@@ bar is selected .
I want to select the Tren@@ to ( left above ) for my tool bar . after selecting the element , which should be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow button to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
I would like to make a quick way to access the quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar .
please note , as the Tren@@ to support the group . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool bar could believe that the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; button on the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested through stim@@ ulation of all symbols to ensure that everything works .
secure the right folder , after Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , but your tool bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust their &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that their tool@@ bar will be loaded ( s ) if a file is open from the corresponding type .
perhaps the most chosen expansion of &amp; quantitative enlargement ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation to the script language or the form@@ att@@ ing language that you like to do in love . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check back in &amp; quantitative ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory whether someone has already done for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you have to search an existing documentation for the form@@ att@@ ing / script / etc . language . then you need to create the doc@@ r@@ c file . we will need to handle the second part here .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c You = Path , relative to this file , e.g. php@@ 42 / # Elements in the main index Top element = your description for these docum@@ entations , e.@@ Sec@@ 2.@@ 3.@@ html Section 2 = # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ .@@ tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ n@@ 3 = tag@@ .@@ html 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation as something :
# K@@ DE config file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c Download = php@@ 42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 , # Get@@ ting Start@@ ed , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x@@ .@@ html ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = .@@ age@@ .@@ basic syn@@ thes@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . it shows that there are sub @-@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the chess boards ( except the understanding ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it out .
note that the table of contents can be refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consistent , at the upper end of the building view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folders will be displayed ! ) .
spaces do not affect nothing but pay attention &amp; B &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quantitative ; Res@@ our@@ c@@ end@@ ums will be replaced .
the section of the doc@@ r@@ c file is used to be displayed on the writing of a &amp; PHP ; the documentation for the m@@ ys@@ q@@ l _ fet@@ ch _ array function is to be displayed . by selecting the function name and pressing C@@ tr@@ l ; H for context @-@ help would be the documentation directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text List ) and the file attach@@ ments .
a simple list of separate text elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can store your file doc@@ r@@ c simply save and proceed to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / Quant@@ a / doc / Quant@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc / quantity for local and global use . then create a folder ( as if you specify this in your file doc@@ r@@ c ) in the same folder as doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that these are good and it &apos;s worth to be shared , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information about the &amp; quantitative policy ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory for use by the &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but are proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; quantitative , you are not alone . it is possible to divide resources ( D@@ T@@ EP packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can send us by email to friends , partners or otherwise . at different locations , there is a email address , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ T@@ EP ) with email , email , in context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts .
the resources can be up@@ loaded into our head archive , from where all other &amp; quantitative users can download . the contributions are checked and only available for publication if our team needs them as correct and useful for publication . to ensure a valuable contribution , the source of resources ensures that our team will be ensured , both our team as well as for the subsequent users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for their private G@@ PG key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase will not be saved ) , or in the case you can check out multiple keys . if you have multiple keys , the input fields must be filled ( URL preview can be empty ) and click OK to upload the upload button .
the upload may also be up@@ loaded from the menus D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ T@@ EP ) , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts .
after downloading a resource , even before installing the resource , exam@@ ines &amp; quantitative . in case of problems , it can be war@@ ned . please note the warning messages carefully . if the integrity are given and the resource is correct , a message appears with the indication of the origin@@ ator of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages , which is currently not able to work by a D@@ T@@ EP package , but it can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files in day XML format might be needed . there is the sim@@ pler way to convert a D@@ TD automatically into a D@@ T@@ EP package .
the conversion can be started from the menu D@@ TD store and converting a D@@ TD . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD description which should be used . afterwards the following dialog appears :
target name : the newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; this name will be written in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / d@@ te@@ p folder with this name .
! DO@@ C@@ TY@@ PE defin@@ itions : the string , which should appear in ! DO@@ C@@ TY@@ PE day , such as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC - / / W@@ 3C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / Cle@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d should appear
fine adjustment of D@@ T@@ EP after conversion : when activated , brings &amp; quantitative policy ; after conversion the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; quantitative , there are some key concepts . to understand these concepts and full benefit from &amp; quantitative . this chapter is trying to bring them exactly these concepts without their understanding and quantitative .
in &amp; quantitative , the working range is divided into three areas : global , local , local and projects . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; quantitative .
global elements are for everyone , the &amp; quantitative , uses , available . from tool@@ bars over promotions is all that is marked as globally , in common folder structure of &amp; quantitative . this enables the group of administ@@ rators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree that will be available in any multi @-@ user environment at the system .
local items provide a personal collection of web developments for a single user . these are custom patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in user directory , so that users can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; - designs up to tool@@ bars with special promotions specifically designed for the files of a specific project . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which represents the common use of special tools and designs of all employees within the project .
the &amp; quantitative ; -@@ MDI ; consists of some main areas : the Edit@@ or@@ window , the building prospects , the cart@@ oning with information and tool@@ bars . please strike in , and for further information on these areas .
you can click the Cart@@ ei@@ v@@ ans with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the latest documentation , such as close to the current , other or all Kart@@ u@@ re@@ iter , re@@ load or upload the document , jump to a book@@ marks or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right click on the editors for a further context menu concerning the revised document content , such as basic processing steps ( cut / copy / ein@@ gs ) , editing the mouse under the mouse poin@@ ter or open the file , if the string below the mouse poin@@ ter a file .
at the upper end of the editors are the display panels of the Ed@@ itors . currently , &amp; quantitative ; 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional are displayed as standard , for which a set of tool bar is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; quantitative methods , the tool will be adapted to the new functions and thus connected user requirements .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert the symbol which represents the day , then click the data for this just entered day . if you want to insert the data for this straight day , you should fill out several attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog for different fields .
the design views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate to the information and quantitative . in the representation of cart@@ ograph@@ ers are available for files , project , templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation constructions available .
project Management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; quantitative tool . this view shows all files in the project and allows you to manage files in the project via right mouse click . actions like add , removing , up@@ loading or delete files from the storage medium can be performed with the then displayed context menu .
another option of &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . there are all possibilities open .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which they are used . global templates are always available , local templates only for the relevant users and templates are only available in the project . more on templates can be found in the project .
here you can find information on the available script languages . the concept of re@@ integration in Global , Lok@@ al and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retri@@ eve the available information on a script . via the right mouse button , further functions are available , such as the script to start or send an email to .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor is placed on the position of the element . by right click of an element , a list of commands will open in terms of navigation and view of the tree .
this tree appears under the other main views . with it , man@@ fast attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change . the changes of all available attributes with a few clicks is possible .
here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development . it can be downloaded documentation for &amp; quantitative information ; it can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be edited , edited and viewed .
by default , &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; two cart@@ ons at the bottom end of the window that can be reached via the useful information can be reached : the message window and the problem window .
this Cart@@ ei@@ re@@ iter shows information on each in Quant@@ a running script . thus , e.g. the D@@ TD of the current document and all changes to the D@@ TD is displayed .
this Cart@@ ei@@ re@@ iter shows all bugs in the market up of the current document . &amp; quantitative information ; scripts that are executed , enter all error messages ( as there is ) in this window .
the &amp; quantitative , tool bar are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they will receive the corresponding command . the chocolate page of the tool@@ bar is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; quantitative .
another feature of &amp; quantitative , is the ability to send a tool@@ bar by email . &amp; quantitative information ; sends the tool bar as a compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; via mail ; if they receive a tool@@ bar in an email , they can secure this in &amp; quantitative ; like any other secure and charge !
it is reasonable if you want to custom@@ ize the place of &amp; quantitative policy ; it has auto@@ conf a number of options to get to the match script . to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not performed here .
if you have problems at start &amp; quantitative ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folders . also you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in P@@ AT@@ H in front of their bin folders . same applies to &amp; Q@@ t .
&amp; quantitative , is a web development tool for K@@ DE surface . &amp; quantitative and is optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful features .
during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; quantitative idea began to deal with a standing , exten@@ dable Mark@@ up languages ? well , this would be an absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; quantitative ; now far on the way to a general and extensive web development tool . combined : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then you should look at &amp; quantitative ; for this is the appropriate &amp; IDE ;
well , to the af@@ ore@@ mentioned claim must be noted that &amp; quantitative policy ; as a product is based on the outstanding efforts of free software , the idea of why ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; rum@@ or is not just this everything possible , but allows users and developers , &amp; quantitative and developers ; as they need for their needs .
&amp; quantitative data ; enables to increase the use of a intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( MDI ; ) . this can also increase productivity with self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars . by the program comp@@ ress , they can realize &amp; quantitative tax . ( more about it can find them in . )
&amp; Quant@@ a ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for fast Web development and quickly expanded to a mature editor with many powerful features .
&amp; Quant@@ a ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Quant@@ a ; the original developers left the GPL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more detailed documentation is done with help : / Quant@@ a ( either this URL in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; enter or execute the help center help : / Quant@@ a ) .
&amp; Quant@@ a ; is currently developed and supported by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de.@@ org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de.@@ org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list is changed every time if you don &apos;t open a file , where the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and all files as templates for later use . check in the section about templates . should you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project leader , only one error is reported .
converted to insert from the cli@@ p@@ board there are special characters available to &amp; HTML ; det@@ ective , so that it is correct and not understood by the browser as form@@ att@@ ing instructions .
convert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ statement that the correct way to insert special characters and space characters in &amp; URL ; s is primarily used to insert &amp; URL ; s in the anch@@ ors day .
the block selection to or from . that allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift ; button to select .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script error messages are available !
sear@@ ches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a sort of gre@@ p or SE@@ D with GUI and pre@@ defined identification to help you .
shows the message window to or not . that &apos;s the window in which you see the display of scripts and deb@@ ug@@ ger .
evaluation and Swit@@ ching of the problem repor@@ ters at the bottom edge of the &amp; quantitative . problem repor@@ ter will be activated as soon as you changes to the structural tree .
shows the symbol no left from the main window . this column allows you to set , book@@ marks with a mouse click .
when the file is book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu with entries pre or next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sor in the document .
book@@ marks from other open documents appear in the menu , after the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from hard drive . &amp; quantitative project ; Projects are stored with File Extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for insertion files into the current project . select the selected files will then be copied to project directory .
sear@@ ches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows , e.g. graphics files in your project folder or a sub @-@ folder and then add them to the project .
load the files in your project on the server high . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; from and whether you have downloaded further input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
att@@ itudes , such as &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; quantitative information ; Projects are explained by details .
invites you a project certification . these are kept in project you / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu , if you have assigned them this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : locally or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . these can only be added to the names . actions need to be added . tools must be saved through tool@@ bars , or you will be asked to save whether you want to save the tool@@ bars .
remov@@ es a tool@@ bar from the sight area . the del@@ etes it not from hard disk . if you don &apos;t have the tool@@ bar yet , you are asked if you want to do this .
so you can send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( maybe on the &amp; quantitative us ; -@@ team , so the tool@@ bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endix .
enables up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where every other can access it . see in .
load a &amp; D@@ TD , which you have made or someone else has and convert into the &amp; quantitative format ; own c@@ ession format .
invite / ref@@ res@@ h to re@@ alities from the &amp; D@@ EP ; it is meaning@@ ful if the re@@ alities from the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; if this global is , and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not available , f@@ ails to loading .
this menu contains a list of tags that are loaded in the currently loaded tool@@ bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu Standard menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool bar .
allows access to the current tag dialog when there is one . this entry is always available in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub@@ men@@ tions .
activated or de@@ activated the intelligent insert of tags . currently , this is only possible with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent insert means that &amp; quantitative in@@ us is ref@@ using , if this day is contra@@ di@@ cted to the rules of this place .
in the plug@@ ins menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed below the menu listed menu . click here . click on a activated plug @-@ activated .
select the synchron@@ izing mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schem@@ ata depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; version .
select the type of line identification . very useful if you know people to use the other OS platforms to the developers . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
check the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; D@@ TD , using the external application T@@ id@@ y .
immediate switch between the different types of user interface . by some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , the switch can sometimes need or not a nice graphics . recommended default card mode , which is also the default setting , or the lower window setting , which corresponds to the display in &amp; quantitative mode ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains an entry . additionally , the menu item is activated . the corresponding window will be activated .
switches the indication of the status bar at the lower edge of the &amp; quantitative .
changes in this dialogue im@@ pressing any application that use the K@@ HTML @-@ Part , including the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web@@ browsers .
judge the behavior of the editors . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; you can find details .
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the tool@@ bar or modify them and can change the line .
this should generate a help according to the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; quantitative , is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always support help . if they want to support &amp; quantitative form ; development in financial form , they find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled at the best from top to bottom , as for example , after filling the project , the whole directory structure is completed automatically . all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is checked automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; quantitative project ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( eg f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can use the server address of the machine that you want to access the local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible .
if you use this field empty , the default settings of the chosen protocol is used . depending on the computer &apos;s setup , a adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to project and standard templates . if a common collection of files are used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars can be stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a joint collection of files are used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of standard .
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or folders can be selected .
this setting is great when you have static website content you can download and change it . by ser@@ ver@@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc . ) one must be different .
apply , when files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project are to be bound , if a project is newly started , not connected .
with this option all the files and folders are displayed inside the main board and you can make an accurate selection according to good fertil@@ ization .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files through An@@ h@@ ack , or by removing the her@@ esy , cl@@ amps from the project .
the last screen of the new project assist@@ ants contains three settings that simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can also be up@@ loaded in the menu with the project Properties in the menu window or with the button Shift Shift ; F@@ 7 will be changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project assist@@ ants and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholder possible ) , which can be re @-@ read in project @-@ related operations like project folders .
additional option to top , even files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ signal are excluded from the project .
the project view , which will be loaded when opening the project . can be read more about projection views .
thus the desired deb@@ ug@@ ger can be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ in can be set using the Options . in case the trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting can be described .
in the sub@@ window profiles , high loading profile ( see in ) can be adjusted , as well as the display of a building view for the content of the server for each profile by using a dedicated building view for each profile .
in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a ma@@ iling list . see details .
in the sub@@ window event configuration , you can switch event actions to change or delete these actions , if a specific event will enter , such as the sick@@ ness of a file . see in details .
by default &amp; quantitative l@@ us opens ; the last project that was opened . this behaviour is currently not able to influence .
to open a different project , select Project ... from the menu Project or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog box will be displayed and allowed the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
if &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , when &amp; quantitative . changed files . same happens if you need a new project .
the project management are free access to the files in the project . you can manage the files in the current project .
folder will be like , however , are missing the entries open and open with ... in with the right mouse button Con@@ text menu :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information on the place of the up@@ loaded files . see .
enables removing of the current profile . if only a profile is present , the button is low to prevent removing .
the password will be kept in the kernel memory and if you forget it . this option is useful if it is necessary to upload files and rather un@@ certain password on the record -@@ option does not occur in question .
this will stop the transfer or leave the dialog if you change your opinion before up@@ loading .
in &amp; quantitative profiles ; can be created many high @-@ loading profiles and thus making the project ( or parts of the project ) to be up@@ loaded to different servers . when working or creation of a profile , this dialog will be displayed :
this is the name of the server which should be copied to the files . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and NFS .

depending on your anxi@@ ety , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it to your discre@@ tion . the password will be stored on the plate , so that it can &apos;t be read easily , but each with programming language can be easily seen in the text @-@ text .
a project view is just a set of files and tool@@ bars . it can be done in a project many views , i.e. by simply changing the view , various files and tool@@ bar can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be opened in the menu project or the project tool@@ bar , accessible via Settings tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar , opened or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; quantitative us ; with which one has to do most on most . this helps increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; quantitative . to the own work mode .
as mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; quantitative ; the best over the menu tool@@ bar can be stack@@ ed . use and add . the add of tool@@ bars will be treated below in the section of the tool@@ bar .
the tool@@ bar and the symbols can be set either by using context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which the new tool@@ bar can be configured , tool@@ bar , ren@@ aming or tool@@ bars , which may be specified in the dialogue , where the actions can be visible on this or other tool@@ bars .
by calling the context menu to a action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries can be removed and action indicated that are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings tool@@ bars ... and set the actions .
templates are in essential docum@@ ent@@ aries , code es@@ cal@@ el and files to lin@@ king . &amp; quantitative information ; used templates basically as a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or any in the system existing directory in the pre@@ ferences tree . templates have in &amp; quantitative information ; in about the restrictions you need for the file system .
some with &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; provided templates have conditions for its use . please read the conditions stipulated in any template prior to use .
Bin@@ ary is everything that it is not pure text . it can be binding any file from text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; bin@@ binary templates are usually inserted in documents via con@@ lin@@ ings ( e.g. images with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples are available in the basic tree below global templates . further information on templates tree is available .
documents can be created from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . usually , a simple report for the purpose and organis@@ es the work in appropriate way to be efficient . some examples can be found in the introductory tree below global templates . see in for more information about templates tree .
this kind of templates is useful if you are not a new document based on a template but the same text area will always be inserted into documents . you can find everything from a comment on a final menu on Javascript or Perl basis . some examples are available in the basic tree below global templates . see in for more information about templates tree .
as the name suggests , these templates are used for whole websites as templates . you are a collection of various documents , which can be organized in a compressed t@@ ar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; quantitative .
design a document structure after exposure ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select File As template when local template ....
as soon as it is done , notice that ( even if it is stored as a project situation ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look under project management .
select text in your document and click file as a template selection as local / project templates . alternatively , the selection can easily be drawn with pulling and off onto the building view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file is only enough to copy the file functions in a folder file , allowing all file management functions to be used , such as pulling and insert or add through the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
one can click on a folder or in the Project files building view onto a folder on a folder and secure a name for the template . by default , it will be backed by default folder , but of course it can be saved as local or global template .
project templates allow a very goal oriented approach mode . you can add head@@ lines and foot@@ lines or dynamic with &amp; PHP ; in addition , some things can be used when using templates in projects very deep @-@ green in the eye .
the structure structure in the sub@@ window template is based on the files created in $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / Quant@@ a / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / Quant@@ a / Templates / Quant@@ a / Templates / Quant@@ a / Templates / Quant@@ a / Templates / templates / templates / templates / Templates / templates / templates / templates / Templates / templates / templates / templates / Templates / templates / templates / Templates / templates / templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates .
to determine the behavior of a folder where the right mouse button click on the folder and select the context menu properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is b@@ lown up , as soon as the attributes can be inher@@ ited .
this is activated by default and fits all common folders in the previous models . if a trunk folder would be set in principle , except they would be explicitly enabled . in case of a regular folder , the bl@@ ah would appear with something like the text module . if nothing appears , it is likely to be found in a trunk folder .
allows or presented text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ lines for all templates for a particular project and allows to equi@@ p a whole presentation in a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ lines to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the matching head@@ lines / foot@@ lines .
in addition , the context menu ( shown on the right mouse button ) have a full command set for adding folders or copy and add templates from one place to another .
&amp; quantitative ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source Editor , which are accessible via the menu . the first mode replaces the source editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second share the editorial window in two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : he invites a document such as a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and when needed for source code editor , which are visible in the source code in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document , the &amp; PHP ; contains a small green symbol the v@@ oh@@ and@@ y of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit this directly to the V@@ PL ; editor . there is no plans to change this behaviour .
the second mode works exactly like the first , besides that the changes are visible both in the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor is enabled , and the cur@@ sor is activated in the source editor and in V@@ PL ; this mode is already active , pressing the active cur@@ sor from a window to the others , whereby the position is retained in the document .
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source editor is adjustable via Settings Quant@@ a .... After selecting V@@ PL ; -@@ view it can be set between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in general , the recommendation can be set automatically . basically , the recommendation can be set automatically . basically , the recommendation can be set for fast computers and a large range of span for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of this website . this is the editing of invisible tags in work with the V@@ PL ; editor is also called , as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor will also be called . this allows the reduction of the hanging body . this means that you can change the following :
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. b@@ words for Internet search engines . met@@ ering elements can be added or removed by pressing the two switching surfaces below or be removed . one click into the list allows the change of in@@ hal@@ ving , e.g. key words on the column name and keywords key@@ word 2 on the contents column .
CSS rules are the new way to design the extension of pages in the browser . you can add CSS rules with buttons under the list or delete . a change on the list is currently not supported on the met@@ a elements .
it is possible to insert an external CSS styles by clicking on the file button and select the appropriate file .
the use of the cur@@ sor is as in a text processing , caused by reference to the arrows . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves as usual . text can be inserted by in@@ ti@@ pping and easily extingu@@ ished by button or swi@@ ft .
the insertion of tags will be made in the same way about the tool@@ bar , as in the source text editor . it is noted that the insertion of tags previously already existing identical tags is not removed , e.g. if an anchor is inserted , each other ambient air is removed .
some tool@@ bars like the tables @-@ assistant or the lists @-@ assistant are de@@ activated . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists tool@@ bar must be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the investigation of styles . in contrast to other programs for styles is the search for certain elements possible and the execution of styles can be pursued .

there are many graphical tools for the same . why so &amp; diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contributions made many changes and simultaneously correc@@ ts the entry . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts in coll@@ ision .
the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines . and there was no evidence for the positions , where perhaps only the influence was changed . the merge of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could be differenti@@ ated within a line and changes to white characters . later , any quantity of more useful features were added later .
for example , if you want to compare text quickly , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and add it in one of the comparative window .
a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and merge of folders . this function turned &amp; cr@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a fully @-@ known file browser .
also 3 @-@ way coll@@ ateral is fully supported . this is useful if two persons can work independently of one piece of co@@ de and changes . in this editor , you can even edit the result . in this editor , you can even process the result directly . the screen photo shows three qu@@ ell files when merge :
&amp; diff@@ 3 ; also helps you to compare and merge folders . this screen photo shows &amp; diff@@ 3 ; with the folder merge :
&amp; diff@@ 3 ; displays exact differences and di@@ versi@@ fied in the ways of today &apos;s color monitors . if you often have to check as@@ de , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tobacco are visible . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , you can see at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no trouble if anyone changes the obj@@ ection . )
if a file is equal , and the other distingu@@ ishes itself in one line , then the colour indicates that the file is different . red color means that both files are different .
if all files have the same names , but in different folders , you can make up the ti@@ ff work by simply write the file names of the first file . example :
diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder folder
the opening dialog allows manual winding of file names , selecting from the file @-@ browser ( file ... ) or select an last open file from the opening times . the opening dialog will indicate your choice ; if you do not need to specify the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed .
via the button folder ... you can also select a folder where you can select a folder , if you select a folder , the same or merge of folders will be selected , for B and C , however , use &amp; diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders .
if assembly is crossed , the input field is active for target and editing . however , it is not necessarily required to determine an output file immediately . you can do this step later when saving .
the setup button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before using the same / merge .
sometimes you would like to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text compare . &amp; diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board to the active comparison window . in opening , you don &apos;t need to select files , you can simply close the dialog box with the ab@@ rupt button .
you can also use Zi@@ es and Ab@@ le : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from a editor and let it fall over a comparative window .
what thought is behind it ? sometimes contains a file e.g. several similar functions . if you want to figure out how similar these functions are , that would be a relatively large effort . you would like to compare and compare these relevant sections , and then compare these relevant sections .
note : currently you can extract nothing out of &amp; diff@@ 3 ; only the fl@@ ames of text is supported in a comparative window .
warning : some editors interpre@@ t the pulling and removal of text into another program as slic@@ ing and insert ( instead of copying and insert ) . in such cases your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of any text window , the info line of the source code contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that windows C is optional ) . ( if the path is too long ) , let the mouse allow for a while over the line . then a small auxiliary window will show the full name . )
the three sources are assigned to the letters A , B and C . A has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( this default settings can be changed over the settings menu . )
if a difference is detected , one can distingu@@ ish on the color , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files . this is good in the next section ( merge ) .
on the left next to the text is the column @-@ column . if differences were found , the colour is not so important . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + , e.g. , white characters are only in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare individuals . )
the vertical line , which separates the coll@@ ateral column is interrupted by the text , where the source file does not have lines . if the line is activated , the line will be displayed on the broken lines .
the result window ( below the comparative calculation ) also has an Info line with the inscription output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; Ge@@ changes &#93; if you have processed the result . usually , it contains the automatic result , but often also contains conflicts .
! ! ! ! until all conflicts have dis@@ band@@ ed , the saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons to take root sol@@ ving / un@@ expect@@ ation conflict around the remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ isons are used , each difference must also be solved at the same time .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the window , the group is marked in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed . this group will then highlighted the current group . this group is highlighted by color background color for current area and each on the left is a black beams .
sometimes , through the automatic merge or by manual loading , no further line will be left in the text , then you will change your mind and perhaps again another source . this text appears not in the final stored file , yet in a marking which may perhaps copy and add differently .
the text &amp; lt ; abstra@@ ction con@@ flu@@ ed ; however , in the cli@@ p@@ board , if you copy such text from the chapter window . go carefully with this function .
note : if the sources select the options are igno@@ red or Ig@@ nor@@ iere C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are treated as white characters .
this will navigate mainly to the image run and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are in one of the window , you can use the arrow keys left , right , at the end , C@@ tr@@ l at the beginning and C@@ tr@@ l end , Si@@ w , as you can also use it from other programs . if you can also click here to Navig@@ ate .
in the eye window , you can also use the other keys to work . using the insert button , you can switch between instruction and transfer mode . ( default is the plug @-@ in mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as already in the section ) and the ed@@ itable issu@@ ing window was explained ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the current / previous difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ down / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ down / C@@ tr@@ l image downhill ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ down / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture ) , even after manual dis@@ sol@@ ving conflicts has to be distinguished between dissolved and un@@ inten@@ tional conflict .
to copy the marking in cli@@ p@@ board , you need to copy the Copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l @-@ insert ) . if this option is enabled , it will be automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board and it is careful if you might write to the content of the cli@@ p@@ board .
Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ches are stored according to the regulated operating system \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 reserves the line @-@ line \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 reserves the line @-@ end of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; diff@@ 3 ; also do not use binary files .
the options and list of the recently used files will automatically be saved and re @-@ produced during the next start . ( menu Ins@@ ulation - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 setup ... )
choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialogue also provides fonts with variable width , but you should not use it . )
if you enable this option , differences in cur@@ sive script will be displayed . if the selected writing is not supported , nothing happens .
in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be represented . in these systems , the button pres@@ ets automatically introduces an un@@ controlled color .
when this option is enabled , the tab button is inserted the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator sign will be inserted .
if you press entering or Return , the submission of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
when this option is activated , each selection will be automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . the manual is then dischar@@ ged in the cli@@ p@@ board .
you can select which Z@@ eil@@ ing type you prefer to store . the default value is the commonly usual selection of the operating system used .
when using files , try &amp; diff@@ 3 ; first , all completely identical lines will be igno@@ red in the source files . in this step , white characters can not be igno@@ red . in this step , white characters are not igno@@ red . even during merge , white characters are not igno@@ red .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a wagon mark &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others again save one line @-@ c@@ ub &apos; \ &apos; . usually , however , files with different sizes in the page @-@ to @-@ page comparison look identical , but as if this option is enabled , this option needs to be disabled . in default , this option is de@@ activated .
the default option is de@@ activated this option . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters are igno@@ red , but the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white characters .
the default option is de@@ activated this option . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters .
intensive after even smaller differences are looking for . the option is activated in the default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in the automatic @-@ step mode , this setting is determined , as long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next open conflict will continue .
automatically dis@@ solves all conflicts in white characters by using the chosen file . ( default is manual selection . ) that is useful if the automatic selection also should be solved in numbers or comments , if the options are igno@@ red in numbers or comments , if the options are igno@@ red or Ig@@ nor@@ iere C / C + + comments .
these options are described in the chapter on scanning of folders and guides . look for details under documentation to the directory comparison and merge .
if a file is stored and already an older version exists , then the original version is the suff@@ ix .@@ original mount . if already such a backup file is created with Suff@@ ix .@@ original , this is without any further backup .
adjust@@ s the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current program . you must stop &amp; be rest@@ art@@ ed , making the change is active . ( this option is not available in K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set to the global control centre there . )
the following coding settings can be set separately for each entry , when this option is activated , the upper setting is used for all entries .
on the selection fields for coding , a short notice of what the local coding is . ( this can &apos;t be changed here and has an inform@@ al character for you . )
custom@@ ize the file code for source files . this is how special characters are treated and interpreted can be interpreted individually . since the encoding for each file can be adjusted individually , even files can be compared with different coding .
if you have a file , you can define which coding is to be used to store .
if you define pre @-@ processing , they could not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files may work 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) using this option you can define the encoding of output files .
turn off this way to supp@@ ress the ill@@ ings of changes into white characters in the text or review levels . ( note : this applies to changes in numbers or comments when the options are igno@@ red or Ig@@ nor@@ iere C / C + + comments . )
this selection is available only if you compare three files . in normal mode all differences between two of three files are displayed . after selecting from A &amp; B ; -@@ gt ; B , A &amp; B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is displayed next to the normal only su@@ prem@@ ise column with the required information .
sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines . simply click the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
returns the comparison window side or over@@ lap . this can also be useful for displays of long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes , consider the differences and decide to merge the files using the merge menu , even if you want to compare files from the last source file as a default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to rest@@ art the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
while reading a file it will be delivered to this external command . in &amp; diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor , which is exactly your needs . you can remove this function e.g. for out @-@ cut parts or to correct the entry .
when reading a file it will be delivered first to this external command . if also a normal pre @-@ processing command was specified ( see above ) , the issue of command is used only when using a line output . you can write your own pre@@ processor , which corresponds to exactly your needs . each input line must have an associated output line .
the thought behind it is to enable the user more flexibility when ordering the di@@ ff results , but most users don &apos;t want to program it . however , the good news is that SE@@ D or per@@ l is completely sufficient .
use this pre @-@ processing command for tick @-@ off to convert the input into large letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ Change the found text in the first cl@@ ine pair . the \ \ U converts the found text in upper@@ case .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some key words around automatically generated character strings ( info : / c@@ vs / key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ \ \ _ BAR _ _ \ \ $ \ \ _ BAR _ Author \ \ \ _ BAR _ _ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you have to experiment with SE@@ D , you might get to understand it and perhaps like this regular expres@@ sions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
that &apos;s igno@@ red by numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for a further processing command set for line off . SE@@ D &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a suitable matches , and each hits will be replaced by nothing , thus virtually be deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several requirements at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the requirements of each other . example :
instead of SE@@ D you can also use something different such as per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ e &apos; s / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / replacement / switch &apos; aller@@ dings are different from per@@ l . where SE@@ D \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs per@@ l only ( and ) without the leading &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre @-@ processing will be retained for display and merge . further operations change only the data that the ignition angle equals @-@ al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus .
note : in rare cases if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ off @-@ pre@@ processor sees the output of normal pre@@ processor .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or differences , you can &apos;t notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case .
often , programmer to process many files in one folder . for this reason , you can compare with &amp; diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively compare and merge .
... makes for each object a proposal to merge ; you can custom@@ ize the proposal before the start ,
... can simul@@ ate and simul@@ ate the simul@@ ated changes , without they do it ,
... will select selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F6 key ) ,
this is similar to the same and merge of individual files very similar . you only need to specify a folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three folders will be merged , then folder 1 is used as a basis . if no target folders is used , &amp; diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folders .
note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically , not the merge . to start the merge , you must press the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow ) .
while reading the folder you informs you a little news window about the current progress . if you start scanning the folder , only the files are listed , which were compared to then .
if the scanning of the folder is complete , displays &amp; diff@@ 3 ; a List@@ ing window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and each folder that was found during the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click here .
the folder is normally folded up . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object or use the arrow buttons for left / right . the directory menu contains two features All sub@@ directories fl@@ aps and all sub@@ directories can fold with them all the folders or fl@@ aps .
if you double click on a file , the file comparison will start and it appears a comparison window .
the icon in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folder , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window on the selected object . in such cases the merge tool can not be selected automatically . if the assembly is started , you will be informed about problems of this type .
as shown in the above picture , the A / B / C contains the colours red , green , yellow and black .
with identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of entries is different .
folders are considered identical if its entire content is identical . then also folders are the same color . with folders , the age is un@@ significant for its colour .
the idea to this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . colours reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow becomes and later when it is old , red becomes red .
... A and C identical but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C identical but not a : copy of A ( or if A not exists , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C does not have the same file type ( e.g. if A a file and B is a file ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory file types . as long as such incorrect objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
... A and B does not have the same file type ( e.g. if A a file and B is a file ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory file types . as long as such incorrect objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
the mode to synchron@@ ize mode is active if only two folders and no exp@@ ir@@ relevant target folders were used and if the option directories are synchron@@ izing . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist but not identical to : merge and the result in both folders . ( the user can see as the visible file names for the output file only B ; directly after the merge and diff@@ user 3 ; B according to A. )
when two folders are merged and select the newer file instead of merge ( in@@ secure ) , then exam@@ ines &amp; diff@@ 3 ; the date of files are different , but the same date will appear differently , but the date is identical .. such as such bugs are not removed , the merge can &apos;t be started .
during the merge , a file is working according to the other . it has a status column indicates that when the coll@@ ision was successful , and correspon@@ d@@ ingly other messages when coll@@ ateral is finished , you should make a last review and see if the status is everywhere in order .
if the dialog box dialog is selected , K@@ Is 3 further columns . these include the number of Com@@ for@@ ter , dissolved , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for dissolved conflicts will only be displayed if three folders can be compared or merged . )
you can either merge either the just selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at one time . if you have selected all inter@@ mitt@@ ent actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can run the merge .
note : if you have no target folders then , in the three @-@ folder merge mode C , the target is used as a target and used to synchron@@ ize A and / or B as a target .
if you select a target folder , please check if all entries should be displayed in the target folder , even in the folder file , there are some options due to certain entries . check these options to avoid un@@ pleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directories start / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key root ) . to perform only the current entry : choose action of the current element or press F6 .
if by contra@@ dic@@ tory file types there are still inv@@ alid merge actions , a message appears to be displayed on the incorrect elements . you can choose to select a valid promotion .
if you merge all entries , a dialog window will run with the options , em@@ ulate and vom@@ iting .
select Sim@@ ulate if you would like to see what would happen to happen without the really changes . you will then get an extensive list of all actions .
&amp; diff@@ 3 ; then add certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( merge to a single file ) , then a merge window will open ( please note the screen photo ) .
if you are ready to start with a file , choose a directory entry / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you are not yet saved , a corresponding dialog appears . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work will continue with the next entry .
when &amp; diff@@ 3 ; on an error , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list , you can try to ski@@ p the cause of the problem . if you want to try to navigate the cause of the problem , or to solve the problem , or to solve the problem in any way , before you proceed with the merge .
if some entries were log@@ ged together , see &amp; diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and leads them not even again . even if the merge has not been saved or not saved , these entries will be considered . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; diff@@ 3 ; ( Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 setup ... ) has now a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that fit onto the samples are displayed in the element tree . you can use multiple patterns . separate placement holders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folder must not comply with this pattern .
files and folders that correspond to this design are not displayed in the element tree , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
files and folders that correspond to this design are not displayed in the element tree , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
igno@@ red files that are also igno@@ red by CV@@ S . many aut@@ ism@@ atic files are igno@@ red by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder can be configured with a .@@ c@@ v@@ signal file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ signal . )
in some file systems , files are encoded - attri@@ bute . this option lets you decide whether these files will be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in the default setting .
with links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic short@@ cuts are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to the links . this is de@@ activated in the default .
with links to the folder : if the option is switched on , the links like normal folders are treated and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not on possible complaints would lead to a folder that would lead to an end loop and add &amp; cr@@ diff@@ 3 ; ) This option is shut down in the default .
a complete analysis of each file through and displays the statistics @-@ columns . ( the number of dissolved , un@@ Com@@ for@@ ter , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and considerably slower when it is applied to files that contain no text . ( give an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders through a slow network , it may not get faster , only the change date and file size . however , this speed is a certain degree of safety . please use it with caution . this option is activated in the default .
similarly to the change date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if it has lost big if when copying the change date is lost . please use caution . this option is activated in the default .
activ@@ ating the sync mode if two folders are compared to and no target folders . in this mode , the proposals will be identical , so that both folders are identical . also the results of merge files are stored in both folders . this option is shut down in the default .
if there are differences , instead of merge the copy of the newer file is proposed as the action . ( this is the knowledge that the other file does not change also . ) This option is posted in default .
if a file or a file is replaced , then the original version is renamed or deleted the extension .@@ orig@@ ine . if an old backup file is already exists , this will be deleted without further backup . this also applies to the normal merge of single files , not only the mer@@ chan@@ ger file . this option is enabled in the default .
normally , the folders merge view remains visible with the merge of individual files ; you can switch the window divider with the mouse . if you do not want to switch the window and text window , main window will switch to the window menu and switch between the two views between the two views .
probably , you prefer to compare a file just using double click . however , there is also a file menu in the menu . as soon as you need to save the folder , the status will be removed from the merge menu . as soon as you use the result , the status will be removed and the file will not be merged again when you merge the folder .
this status is lost however , if you have again read the directory : directory menu : new .
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders to open , which are located on local or remote computers .
the first command line resem@@ bles a local file with one FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . a few things should be aware of :
a path can be relatively un@@ und@@ y or .. included . that &apos;s not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolutely .
special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , spaces &gt; % 20 , etc . ) , for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes , due to the server system on the server , sometimes by the protocol . it follows a short list of restrictions :
or it cannot be classified as a link to a file or a folder . then , a file will always be accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no possibility to edit per@@ missions or change of invoice . therefore , the per@@ missions or change of change from the original . ( please note the option ) ( This is only possible for local files ) .
the main purpose is currently being used as differences of viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts first ever to start the built @-@ in differences , press the right mouse button on the differences viewer and then select In K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
normally requires &amp; diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is used as K@@ Part , decreases &amp; diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the Patch @-@ file . at least one of the two files must exist . then kicks off &amp; diff@@ 3 ; the program patch can recover the missing file .
in the quer@@ or you can select on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that it doesn &apos;t work if any of the original files exists . additionally , this is in@@ reliable if the original files has changed since the creation of the patch file .
when using &amp; diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the same from two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . the merge or the equivalent of folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now it is Com@@ bat ) there is already . furthermore , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already shows that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection .
I have been using GPL programs already very long and I have learned a lot in the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programm@@ ers which went on this road or so let him go so .
you have previously compiled the program from the sources and the computer script will not install the right pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in the default , the resources can not be found in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. , diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find more information about this topic .
if only the number of white characters are different , these lines will be identical as identical ; if only a non @-@ white characters is different , the line is as not identical . if the Lines Lines is next to Each Other , this is is co@@ ined but this is the case .
the editor notice for each difference in the files where it begins and where it ends . this important information is lost , however , if the result is simply stored as text file and it &apos;s too much effort to create an extra file format that could save this information .
the effort for this has been too large . you can always recover a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text , another editor should be used .
after removing the text is suddenly lt ; no sr@@ c lin@@ ens ; published and the text can &apos;t delete . what does that mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors for raising differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use a different editor .
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !
in order to use all functions of &amp; diff@@ 3 ; you will need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
you can find information about how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE you can find on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found in ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the file Ch@@ angel@@ og in the Qu@@ ell package .
to comp@@ ile and install diff@@ 3 ; on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; use the following command in the base folder of &amp; diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are uns@@ af@@ e , you will find further details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .
da &amp; diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . should not occur trouble , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mail@@ ing@@ lists of it .
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ Remove ) into the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . add ( C@@ tr@@ l V or Shift insertion ) add text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position and replaces the current mark .
only differences : files that are identical in all folders are not appear in the folder , and therefore not in target folders .
( in the current program version , you need to re @-@ read the folder with the function updates to these options . )
only entries are displayed , the differences are displayed . if the target folder will not already be copied to the target folders . if the target folder these files are not already modified , they are missing after the merge . ( the behaviour is probably modified in a later program version . ) This option is switched off .
note the buttons to choose from the source with the labelling A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines are attached to the end of the selected group at the end of the selected group ( if they are not already present ) , if the lines are already present , they will be removed from clicking on the button .
the default option is de@@ activated this option . under@@ scores in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini@@ figure of all virtual work surfaces . it is quite practical to change their size on the working area to change their size or move them . this works both within a desktop and also at several .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can view all virtual work surfaces as well as in current applications . the applications can be selected and can be moved to the desktop and to another .
with the central mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a desktop and other working areas .
the context menu depends on it , where the right mouse button is clicked on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; if the context menu will only be clicked on the application and the name of the application as well as the entries must be minim@@ ize , maxim@@ ize , On Desktop and Finish .
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of mind . appears only if you click on a application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . appears only if you click on a application .
if this box is marked , window can be moved within the &amp; c@@ p@@ ager ; it can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other working areas .
when this field is crossed , will be displayed in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the name of virtual work surfaces are displayed .
cross this field you can display the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual work surfaces . it is crossed along with the name , the names will be ordained , and eg ; 1 . mind .
when this field is crossed , the background of each desk is also displayed as background in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager .
if this field is crossed , the current programs will be displayed as small window in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty working area will be displayed to enable their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the propor@@ tions of the program window . icon shows a small view of actual program interface . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager can be used : classic leaves &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; available in a 2x@@ n grid ; horizont@@ ally , all virtual work surfaces in a horizontal position and vertically in a vertical row , which is very good for the presentation on the desktop .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini@@ program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size that can display windows as symbols or with their contents , and is also running outside the control bar .
click the right mouse button within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and the following sel@@ ector switch can be set up ... can be released to the dialog .
currently , this can &apos;t be changed in the dialog for Settings . but you can manually fill it manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ p@@ ag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ e. if you have no write permission for the file , you need to register as user root or login to your system administrator . in this file , you have to set the key win@@ dow@@ Transpar@@ ency mode and to this one value . possible values are :

&amp; can I like ; if you are using &amp; k@@ mag , you can use a magni@@ fying glass . this application is interesting for different users . this application includes artists , web designer and people with a vision . this documentation is to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag .
&amp; k@@ mag is a very powerful application which is constantly extended by new features . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance computers .
if you are able to start a window as pictured above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag is described above . in the following this window is described as a magni@@ fication window . the image that is displayed in the magni@@ fication window is an enlarged range of screen and is described in the following as a selection window .
in the default setting , it can be increased &amp; can ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter like a mobile micro@@ scope . alternatively , you can choose a selected screen area in the magni@@ fication window ( selection mode ) or the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge ( eg ; on the left screen ) .
if you want to avoid the mouse poin@@ ter in the enlarged window , select the mouse poin@@ ter . please note that &amp; k@@ mag is not able to recogn@@ ise the form of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse poin@@ ter .
in the selection mode you can custom@@ ize the selection window to your needs . you can change it with the arrow keys and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fication window and hold the left mouse button , so you can catch the contents of the magni@@ fication screw and post@@ p@@ one . this also works with the arrow keys .
if you additionally fix the &amp; Shift ; press the &amp; M@@ MB , you can move the select window .
with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection pad remains fixed and only the lower right corner is to move .
&amp; can ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer to insert into a file in the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later in other applications ) , the picture turn and much more .
or stop the update of the display . the stop of the update causes that the required CPU time goes against 0 .
select the ref@@ res@@ h rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , H@@ och , Very high ) . the higher the actu@@ alization rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode a selection window will appear . the selected area will be displayed in one window .
&amp; can be used automatically your current short commands to store files , opening a new window , printing , Ne@@ ul@@ aden ( with the button document re@@ load in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; ) , Enlarge and pl@@ ot@@ ers &amp; etc .
can also be known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; if you can use a magni@@ fying glass . you can use a micro@@ scope to view the mon@@ te in a newspaper or a photo . this application is for various people of benefit : from research or artist until Web@@ designer or handic@@ apped .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse click once the mouse poin@@ ter a while on the same place . it is intended to help people who suffer the RS@@ I syndrome ( repet@@ itive DNA syndrome ) and every mouse click pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse click once the mouse poin@@ ter a while on the same place . it is intended to help people who are preparing for the repet@@ itive level int@@ end ( RS@@ I ) syndrome , and each mouse click pain . furthermore , it can em@@ ulate the pulling with the mouse . however , this requires a little exercise .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain , which occurs in the mouse , and helps use so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you should try to try out a doctor with the use of your computer , if this is not done so .
in order to make it once more clear : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will prevent pain , which are caused by clicking with the mouse , it is caused by pain , which is caused by means of the mouse , use , and as for all ergonomic aid : the result can be applied for each different .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movement and leads a mouse click once you break the movement shortly .
if intelligent move is activated , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after it is pressing the mouse button . move it up to the end of the movement before the lot of the mouse button . in this way you can run the pulling in pressed mouse button . the intelligent move requires a little exercise , but you get used quickly .
this temporary times must be used after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . a mouse click away .
if Intelli@@ gent@@ ler is switched on , the shooting time is switched on ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will wait , before the mouse button is waiting , when the mouse button starts again , if there is no evidence for the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is now enabled by clicking a slow motion . this function is enabled , followed by a break , a click with right mouse button . a slow motion to the right and back leads a double click . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ t@@ xt for the first time , but they can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can reduce the response time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to sound &amp; multimedia , select there sound system and here the rider . there is a slide @-@ buffer sound buffer that you can reduce response times to reduce response times .
if this setting is marked , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started . at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments please take the relevant documentation to figure out how you start a program automatically .
put all settings on the values , which were set when opening the dialog box . have already pressed the button instructions , the settings will be reset to the last pressing of user .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first use pres@@ ets with the default settings . in particular , intelligent move should first be switched off . if you click on automatic mouse click the smart move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; by sounds .
first , you should be aware of what places a mouse click without effect : clicking on neutral components of windows or on positions in Brow@@ ser@@ window that do not lead to un@@ inten@@ tionally reactions . you can use the mouse to use such places until you want to use it again .
when your mouse printer , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty easy . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first , you need to remove the mouse ball . as it happens , is different from mouse to mouse , but it should be quickly clear if you watch the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and the pollution can be easily cr@@ ushed with a flat blade or the fing@@ ern@@ a@@ gel .
in very rare situations the operating system breaks down by &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you &apos;re using the intelligent move in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool means that the surgery can no longer be able to finish the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click here . this is the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can work as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run the cur@@ sor into another place .
solution : do you use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor there . but if you don &apos;t use the mouse on a neutral area of mind , if you are using a keyboard player . so a safe zones for the mouse poin@@ ter &amp; eg ; the grey areas for the mouse hand are &amp; eg ; the grey areas around the tool@@ bars and the front@@ lines of windows .
I &apos;m trying to work with the intelligent move , but I do not create it to edit the text .
intelligent move is a advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it needs its time before you want to handle it into the cli@@ p@@ board or want to insert it into the cli@@ p@@ board or to insert any other action , if you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . however , there will probably be some problems . here are some advice here :
use the intelligent move not just when you just start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool instead . select text instead of the text and hold the switch @-@ button pressed while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and again the mouse button .
do you use the audi@@ ble mouse click here . in this way , when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will use a sound like a mouse click . so you can use the intelligent move time without the audi@@ ble mouse click here . but later you need to use some exercise .
in order to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window ; installed . this should be the case most of the system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available when the system has a sound card and speaker and this is correct .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; enter the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter short . this program was developed for people who suffer the RS@@ I syndrome and preparing the bed of the mul@@ tit@@ els pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so that there will be a certain time to start a pulling process before the mouse button is left . in this way , the pulling and dis@@ covering with the mouse can also be performed .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that allows the user to talk their computer for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; you can choose to talk the computer for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation movements that should be spoken again .
on the first side of the assistant ( left screen photo ) you enter the command , which is later used for the language output of text . further details will be found in the description of the entry catalogue .
on the second page , select the standard text @-@ password @-@ book . from the text@@ books you can often choose the text @-@ pass@@ words , without having to get in@@ ti@@ pping . the passages can naturally be processed .
on the third page ( right @-@ screen photo ) , determine the dictionary for Wor@@ lds . &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the word lists of the selected language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can read the word lists with an Open@@ Off@@ ic@@ e.@@ org Dictionary that only correct sp@@ elling words into the Wor@@ lds .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth is clearly structured and contains basically a input field for the keyboard operator of your phr@@ ases ( the lower white field on screen photo ) and a log @-@ in memory of the already spoken phr@@ ases ( the upper white field in screen photo ) .
if you have k@@ mouth ; right , you can enter the propositions you want to hear in the input field that you want to hear . each spoken sentence is attached to the memory memory . you can choose from this phr@@ ases that should be spoken again .
with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; edit ... open the dialog dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialogue contains two card cards , language output and settings , the page Wor@@ ter@@ nal , and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of Cart@@ ei@@ Card Voice Edition , enter the command to enter the voice . in the selection field , you set the character encoding that will pass through the text to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two types to ad@@ mit the text . select the box , if the text is unchanged as standard input to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text is given as parameters . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
of course the command to your language generator depends on your language generator . this command can be found in documentation to your language generator . examples for this is found in app@@ endix .
with the kt@@ d as a language service , &amp; k@@ mouth ; as first attempt to pass the text for the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the check @-@ up language is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Pro@@ dem@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications a standardized interface for voice output . the option of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action , after selecting a text passage , determine which action is triggered by the button door or by selecting a text passage in the menu text @-@ pass@@ agen@@ book or in the strip for text @-@ pass@@ words .
with the selection of So@@ fort , the selected text passage will be addressed directly and in addition to the disk space . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage will initially be entered only in the input field .
with the second selection box switch for text box , you can define if the text @-@ pin book on the closing of the processing window will be automatically saved .
with the selection of text matching manual , the book is stored . if you choose to throw the text @-@ password , select &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text @-@ fit book is to be stored .
the site Wor@@ ter@@ ess contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for Wor@@ lds . in the main window , shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection field , when this list contains more than a dictionary . with this selection box you can choose the current dictionary for Wor@@ lds .
with buttons on the right , you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add the order of the books or add them into a file . below the list you can set the name and set the language for the dictionary .
for this source , select the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of the individual words is simply determined by number of words . in addition , you can compare the word @-@ list with an Open@@ Off@@ ic@@ e.@@ org Dictionary , to insert just right @-@ described words into the new dictionary .
with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries lead , and how these weights are supposed to be found .
with this option , you will create a new , empty Dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; automatically add remaining words into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your voc@@ abul@@ ary during the time .
the main section of the window for the processing of text @-@ pass@@ ers is two @-@ divided . in the upper part , the text pass@@ words are displayed as a tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have a text passage , you can change the text passage or the corresponding button sequences . if you have a textbook book , you can only change its name .
actions like new passages or books add or selected text pass@@ words and books can be found either via selecting in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a hing@@ ed menu .
the order of text @-@ pass@@ ers or Text passages can be changed through the mouse to the new job or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; -@@ button .
the chosen text is cut and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , this will be used otherwise the selected ranges of the memory .
the selected text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , this will be used otherwise the selected ranges of the memory .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if text in the input field is used , this will be used otherwise the selected sentences of the multiplier memory .
if this menu entry is crossed , a sli@@ dable tool@@ bar will be displayed with buttons for frequently used commands . the tool@@ bar can be placed directly under the menu bar by clicking on the top left side and pulling the tool@@ bar to another job .
if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow l@@ ath in the lower part of the main window with hin@@ ts over the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not crossed , this status bar will be bl@@ ended .
if this menu entry is crossed , a sliding table for text pass@@ words are displayed with entries . by default , the tool@@ bar can be placed directly under the tool@@ bar . by mouse click on the shaded left side and pulling the tool@@ bar to another job .
probably you have the command for the voice output not properly or not fully entered . open Settings k@@ mouth ; configure ... , open the page general settings and enter the command for voice card &apos;s speech output . ( see installation dialog for voice syn@@ thesizer ) . )
Festival is a language edition of the Edinburgh University . currently only English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ isch are supported . the license allows to use the festival for free and without restrictions .
in order to demonstrate an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is believed that Festival is installed in the folder / usr / local / festival . the command to the language output is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written and Java ; written speech generator . currently , he only supports the English version . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and beyond restrictions .
in order to show an example of the command line for the setup of the language output , Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ eware . the language output is then possible with one of the three command examples :
for the third example , the data must be switched on as default . ( this is the recommended example for the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ ey to form a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to break the text in phon@@ eme . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in phon@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assum@@ ption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA can be installed in / usr / local / Original fax and / usr / local / m@@ bro@@ la .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax is delighted to be the final character of the text , so that an additional sign must be added . the complete command is therefore more elabor@@ ated than in the other examples :
( CAT ) ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ bro@@ la / usr / local / m@@ bro@@ la / dev / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; art@@ spl@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written in a row . the data must be switched on as default .
the Spanish output dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service , which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; uses a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various language output systems .
since the setup of the software only takes place in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use only kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
to set the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which is installed in the installation dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ mouth ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally storage for the language generator ) , which depends on your computer and configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application that can &apos;t speak with people who can &apos;t speak to the text by the calcul@@ ator . there is a list already sung phr@@ ases that the user can re@@ generate new spending .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language syn@@ thesizer . on the computer must be a syn@@ thesizer .
detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( give either this URL to the address bar of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; a or start the help center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the language output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is an modules of existing service which allows for each application to read text by the &amp; D@@ bus ; -@@ interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a partial system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it is a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programmer is ready to be equipped with their applications with T@@ TS capabilities . even the user offers interesting options .
read texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; Kate ; also , if &amp; Kate ; in other &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications is embedded .
the language output is carried out via the program @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher , the various background program such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc .
allows creation of voice expenditure on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; support program .
in Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ice@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Meta @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the language output service of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible windows , the T@@ TS services via &amp; D@@ bus ; offers .
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and device of kt@@ ts@@ d on Arctic m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for web browser and quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a web site or part thereof .
a module for text editor &amp; Kate ; with which a text file can be read or partially read .
in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de.@@ org / mail@@ man / list@@ eners / k@@ de @-@ Acc@@ essi@@ bility . the developers can also be found in the I@@ RC ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de.@@ org , channel # k@@ de @-@ Acc@@ essi@@ bility ) .
before you can access &amp; kt@@ u , you need to install program code @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher and set correctly . see also
for the first start of kt@@ ts@@ ky or as long as yet without speaker , the map ticket is indicated . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the card card will be displayed . see .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ izers offer various languages and voices , such as various male or female , or such that is located at lou@@ dness or speed . you can also call several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should have at least one speaker . you should use at least one speaker , before you are using &amp; kt@@ ops , since the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher is used .
various speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable with several pressure expect@@ edly for the same printer .
if you click on the cart@@ oning card speaker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card is nar@@ row@@ ed . these will appear automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ ky and still not a speaker .
all the speakers will appear in this list . the preferred speakers will appear in the list . the top speaker is used for the language output when applying a application .
choose a mouse click a speaker from the list , and then click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
choose a mouse click a speaker from the list , and then click on this button to change the settings . see below .
choose a mouse click a speaker from the list , and then click on this button to push the speaker at the list below . the order of the speaker in the list also determines its priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; system .
choose a type of tuning , there are three male and three female voices as well as a Jun@@ gen@@ - and girls and girls .
when you click here , the new spokes@@ person on the map ticket is subject to change . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can check &amp; kt@@ u . go back to the map of General and check if your speech output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is crossed , so the T@@ TS service of &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ops ; use to create text messages to create text applications and manage . see .
when you set up at least one speaker , you can open the language file system from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the card reader to open this card card . here you can set some general options .
select this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ u . this start is successful , and you can create text applications and allow you to read and read text applications . see . remove the marking , will hold K@@ TT@@ SD and the T@@ TS @-@ System from &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated .
if t@@ ug@@ m@@ gr ends , &amp; kt@@ u is running ; further , if the field &apos;s speech output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is crossed .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ ach@@ m@@ gr appears automatically in the system area of the control strip , it dis@@ appears again as soon as it is closed .
with buttons in this series you can start recording orders , stop , stop and record .
with buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; read in cli@@ p@@ board or open a text file to you . you can also download the speaker for a mission .
click on user or OK , then all included settings are taken on all sides .
the card orders will only be displayed if K@@ TT@@ SD is started . in order to run K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the box name re@@ amer General and cross there speech output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; you can check the text of the displayed page . check first if you want to read and read the text , which should be read , and choose the main menu Tools Text . after a short time , the language version should start .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre@@ ten@@ sion@@ ing and other invisible brands also read .
in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; if you want to read more text here . check first if you want to read and read the text , which should be read , and choose the main menu Tools Text . then you should start the language version .
this also works when &amp; Kate ; embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Quant@@ a ;
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; you informed about the events , you can also read the text of this news by &amp; kt@@ ts ; read the text of this news .
in &amp; conversation ; , the I@@ RC program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can send various types of messages . you can send &amp; conversation ; for example , if you come in an I@@ RC channel , you can read on your nick@@ name . you can then read the I@@ RC news text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry will appear in the menu settings of this program . here , the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy distingu@@ ish themselves according to application .
filter for drawing chain creating a good opportunity in &amp; kt@@ ts ; a good example is a good example . you remove the tags b@@ r and b from the messages that can be sent by mail , and also the expression / local / In@@ box , since that in most cases it can be accepted as provided .
filters are one of the advanced skills of &amp; kt@@ ts ; . for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filter is not required .
in filters , text is processed , before it is sent to the program @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the language , to choose wrong spoken words or ab@@ brevi@@ ations , a suitable language and spokes@@ man to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of syn@@ thes@@ izers and their voices .
in order to understand the working mode of filters it is important to know how the program &quot; page disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; diff@@ ers four kinds of texts .
the output of Screen re@@ ins has the highest priority . it will be drawn to all other orders and will hold these orders . if the output of the screen Reader is read , the orders will be continued again .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important News such as &amp; eg ; processor is too hot . a warning has preced@@ ence and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be resum@@ ed after the release of the warning .
News have the next priority priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example for an application that lets you use &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone welcome you to enter the room . &amp; k@@ de ; al@@ erts are also news . read here .
the rest are simple text applications . each mission is a text order . KS@@ ay@@ it is a text order . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications that have been used in text applications . text orders are intended for the output longer texts that have no particular drums .
all four order types are processed in maintenance @-@ long , with the exception of the output of Screen re@@ aders . if an application reads the output of a screen @-@ reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just a such pres@@ reads , this edition will hold and finished .
first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ ders . they will be applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text applications as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News .
filter edit the text and give it to the next filter . at present there are three types of filters .
filters are available as modules . in the future , there may be more types of filters in the future .
substitute parts of a text , replace parts of a text by other text . you can specify either as words or as regular expres@@ sions , which will replace the detection of chat @-@ E@@ mot@@ ions as : - ) by text or for converting messages from &amp; con@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; @-@ mail ; in a better under@@ stand@@ able form .
&amp; XML ; trans@@ duc@@ er use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format into another format . in delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are contained in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
with speaking per@@ formers , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program , send the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you have set a female voice , you can read text by K@@ DE messages about it .
each of these different filter has adjustable rules , after which he is applied for a voice output . if the filter is specified that its rules does not apply , he gives the text to the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning , or a k@@ ite ; -@@ Noti@@ fication of &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent by all activated filters which have been arranged on the side down . the processing of filters are carried out in the order in the list below .
this shows the list of normal filters . is a filter not crossed , it is not activated and is not used . filter will be processed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of the filter , and it will be shown below the below dialog boxes .
for the installation of character strings , you need to enter a list of words or regular expres@@ sions as comparison pattern . if the text is replaced in the text , then the text is exchanged with the corresponding replacement text . large and small sc@@ roll@@ ment is not regarded as opposed to comparison .
in order to specify a name for your filter . this name can choose between the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expres@@ sions . filter compar@@ es the text with the drawing chains in the column match and replaces him in accordance with the character string from the column . the list is processed in the shown sequence from top to bottom .
click here to p@@ one the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can download a list of words or regular expres@@ sions from a file , select the current list or delete . download a list from a file , the entries will be attached to the existing list .
is here a language listed , the filter will only be applied if the speaker for the text order one of the here registered languages . click on the button to show a list of languages . you can also hold several languages if you click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; button pressed .
if a value entered the filter , the filter will only be applied if the text is specified by one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separately by Com@@ mat@@ a . example : conversation , mail
the user @-@ ID running programs is available with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; D@@ bus ; numbers must be bo@@ oming . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copy @-@ 34@@ 32 shows , you may only copy a copy .
the character set filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box did@@ ym@@ es filter . if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts .
in comparison of words , the character filters of regular expres@@ sions used in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words thus must be limited by divi@@ ders ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual you can find no instructions for writing regular expres@@ sions . if you have the &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regulatory &amp; # 160 ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; check out in the package .
&amp; XML ; trans@@ duc@@ er transl@@ ates &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format in another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such form@@ ations . however , it can only be installed on your system . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program must be installed on your system .
specify the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H , is also enough x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
with the optional optional filter you can send texts to a certain spokes@@ man , which is set on a board ticket , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can determine that texts by a female voice should be read by a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text to the filter sur@@ passes the text , the spokes@@ man is available for the text . the speaker is directed to the text , send the text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; send and the characteristics of the board map spokes@@ person is selected . with the speaker optional filter you can over@@ write the selected speaker .
here is a value registered if the text is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call this with one click on the button to get help on the input .
in order to achieve a faster processing , you should try to combine the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
click here the properties of the desired filter conditions . if the text meets the top filter conditions , the speaker is selected , which corresponds to the desired requirements at the eh@@ est . click on the button to indicate the dialogue speech selection .
use these buttons to store your microphone Settings or delete all settings .
the optional optional filter is only applied to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box did@@ ym@@ es Ap@@ ply filter if applicable . you must have at least one condition .
the language output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with the programm@@ ers can give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ;
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , added with the syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that syn@@ thesizer can use .
the following section includes a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ bus ; -@@ interface of the language configuration API from &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / Cat@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de.@@ org ) .
applications demand for language assistance via the &amp; D@@ bus ; interface from &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d on the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
here is text of the text to read and option a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc .
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands
open two &amp; console ; -@@ window . start just kt@@ d in a window , then kt@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned language syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Um@@ reth filters , but when using the module for festival websites are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone , so that you do not want to use this voice , if you do not have this voice to read from websites . make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c installed and can be found via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain signs or inter@@ actions seem to cause errors in syn@@ thesizer , so that all propositions are ski@@ pped or only Kau@@ der@@ ella . what can I do against it ?
first , make sure the option encoding is set to the right value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain signs or words , this may be fixed by a character set filter . see .

the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter , but is not necessarily necessary . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command ap@@ t @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to comp@@ ile &amp; kt@@ ts ; you need to comp@@ ile a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including the packages of p@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program .
if you refer to the source texts by &amp; kt@@ ts ; you have downloaded Tar@@ ball for each night , or install the program with the following commands :
before you can use &amp; kt@@ u , check first if the disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your language syn@@ thesizer . you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ skri@@ pt SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ u . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ g is to be developed so further that the installation of the screen disp@@ at@@ cher is not possible and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is divided into individual propositions . the user can return or retri@@ eval , repeat , output or break down .
when applying an application to &amp; kt@@ ts , it can request the properties of the preferred speaker for the issue . if you choose a speaker , otherwise it will be selected , otherwise the best appropriate speaker is selected . if you want to know more about it , you will find out a speaker , see you in .
if you click on the map ticket spokes@@ man to add or click on Edit menu , the map card speaker device is displayed . as an example , the device map for Festival Interactive is shown below . details on the modules can be found below .
enter the path to the detailed festival program . if the path is included in P@@ AT@@ H , you &apos;ll need to enter the festival only .
select the character encoding for text that will be handed over to the festival . in terms of voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is generally considered that Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 are applicable , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with this sli@@ der , you will provide lou@@ dness , speaking speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select a knob and displayed this grey , the chosen voice can &apos;t be displayed by you .
some voices such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices will require several seconds due to their size . if you select this box , these voices will already be loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( with greater memory consumption ) the first set is qu@@ icker syn@@ thes@@ ized .
if this check box cannot be selected , you don &apos;t have a spokes@@ person ( or forget to view it ) . see .
if this check box is marked with kt@@ ts@@ ky on the program window . otherwise , after the start only the symbol m@@ gr on the system section is visible , but not the program window . click on the icon to display the program window .
if this box is marked and kt@@ ops are not running , it appears in the system area , as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is read a text . this allows you to read or change the possibility of reading or otherwise .
here are all orders placed in the maintenance long run , along with the application that has set the order to the current status of order , the number of propositions and the straight movement . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the map ticket spokes@@ man .
with buttons in this series you can select a full way in the order , which is selected in the list below , - or return . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with one click on OK , all changes of the settings ( also on the other card cards ) and kt@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window .
when the sound system &amp; arts is not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the card card audio . see also .
there are only text applications listed and manages . issues of Screen @-@ re@@ a@@ ders , war@@ nings and messages are not shown . more information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio output . if a component can &apos;t be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled or kt@@ ts ; may not load the necessary libraries .
when G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used to the audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you have to install at least one module , select the PCM device here . see also
set the microphone speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % roughly double normal connection speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be SO@@ X installed .
click on the user to take the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; -@@ system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices comprises all PCM devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to figure out what device works with you . in doubt choose standard .
on this card card you can establish special actions which will always be executed when the text order is interrupted by a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language orders :
the output of Screen re@@ ins has the highest priority . it will be drawn to all other orders and will hold these orders . after the output of the screen Reader was read , orders will be resum@@ ed .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
messages have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example for an application that speaks messages . if you have a long text on a website , you can welcome you with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone welcome you to enter the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen re@@ aders , add &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the qu@@ eu@@ e .
this audio file will always be played when a normal text order is interrupted . if the introductory sound is active as well as introductory news , the introductory sound is played before the introductory message .
the settings on this card card only applies to normal text applications . for messages , war@@ nings and issues of Screen re@@ funds there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ Noti@@ fy @-@ News read , launch kt@@ ops and click on al@@ erts . the map noti@@ fications appear .
mark this box to switch the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; dis@@ abling directions . if this setting is not marked , the other settings are de@@ activated and &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads no al@@ erts .
this setting is marked , al@@ erts where a sound is played by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . if you click on the button , a dialog appears where you want to add the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message that &amp; conversation ; sent when someone mentioned your nick@@ name in an I@@ RC message .
all events that are not specified in the list is igno@@ red by &amp; kt@@ ts ; igno@@ red .
use this selection box to determine what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do if an event is coming . you have the following selection options :
if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
you can also enter the properties of the desired Inter@@ phone . standard sel@@ ects the speaker , which will be displayed in the list on the map map spokes@@ man as the top entry .
note that there are three levels for events . if the action is specified for a specific application , this is executed . otherwise , the action is executed for all other events of the specific application . as last option , the action is set to carrying out under standard ( all other events ) .
the event All al@@ erts for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . you can define the al@@ erts as follows :
use the button to save the settings for the al@@ erts to a file . use the downloaded loading to load saved settings from a file . if you want to start stored with an empty list , click on Del@@ ete . all entries except all reviews are deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to select text for a voice output . this standard contains brands for the control of voices , speaking speed , the voice , the voice of the voice and the pitch . in addition , marks for the control of exclusion from for example ab@@ brevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is a part of Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3C standard .
currently &amp; kt@@ ts only ; SS@@ ML only partly and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) because this is the standard voice to use the festival in the SS@@ ML edition .
if the settings for speed or pitch is not set to 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ ot@@ on .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ positi@@ onal im@@ pregn@@ ation filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds can start up text in individual propositions . as only the first set is syn@@ thes@@ ized , not all the text order . thus , you can also keep track or withdraw or break or break , even if the syn@@ thesizer does not support them directly .
here you can see the sat@@ a lim@@ it@@ ance filters . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , it is set automatically set up a pro@@ positi@@ onal im@@ aging filter . you can modify the settings or add additional sentence detection filters , but is not recommended .
at the easiest way you can check the device selection from and give text to you . if you choose the speaker selection , you can change some features and check how the selection of speaking speaking , if you need more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then qu@@ icker with the reading , as only the first set can be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
you can get assign@@ ments on board ticket orders or can not break even if the syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons the normal set @-@ border filters are automatically set up when you can start kt@@ ops on the first time . it can &apos;t be removed only . do not change anything to this filter , unless you know what you do .
with a regular expression for Sat@@ is@@ sing and add a tab@@ ul@@ atory sign ( Dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the proposition limit ( tab signs are removed from the text ) . please note that the standard proposition zone filter does not retain the character encoding .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News ( k@@ le ) , war@@ nings , news , or the output of Screen re@@ funds .
if you have removed from the normal set limit filter , you can retri@@ eve it again by using the standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c file .
on the card tab , you can over@@ write the microphone Settings for the application . the card card will be displayed , if
using the standard speaker ( the top on the map ) . with other words , there are no speaking properties specified .

I have an additional voice for festival from the Internet . I installed it and can use them in Festival but kt@@ m@@ gr show this voice not .
add the new voice in file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / dict@@ ts@@ d / festi@@ val@@ pin / Vo@@ ices the new vote . if this is successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; in which you have found the voice to the developers .
on the card card audio there is a setting speed . that this works , the program must be installed SO@@ X and via the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ er@@ modul@@ s such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for speaking speed will be igno@@ red when &amp; kt@@ ops ; &amp; HTML ; ( this is sure that the HTML code is converted into SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or if you are very cour@@ age@@ ous , change the .x@@ z file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ according to @-@ SS@@ ML @-@ pass filter , and set up the speaking speed .

before you can check &amp; kt@@ u , check first if your language syn@@ thesizer works correctly . follow the instructions that you have received with syn@@ thesizer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is obvious . the quality of the votes is generally well , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices , you can set noise , speaking speed and pitch .
you need to install at least one language . help you will find in the instructions that are delivered with festival . would you like to read websites you need to install ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices , you need to comp@@ ile an additional module , so you need the source code of Festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on the transfer .
this voice creates Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . if you enter the voice in a early development stage . un@@ pack the software in festival / lib / Vo@@ ices / Russian / . if you enter the Russian votes , you need to enter a k@@ yr@@ illi@@ c _ di@@ phone _ di@@ phone ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is normally included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . search the festival as first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the coding must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the coding must be set to a 8 @-@ bit K@@ yr@@ illi@@ c as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; -@@ syn@@ thesizer . then , Festival takes place the le@@ x@@ ic@@ onic analysis and &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; produced from it the audio output . the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; program and the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; c@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; which enables the management of the network interfaces , the rout@@ ines and the DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; enables the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings on a single , integrated surface . the &amp; c@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; D@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way , such as other settings from the &amp; K@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installing a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; displayed . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) may be launched by a selection of k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; k@@ menu ; started .
it is important to understand that &amp; net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must already be operational and configured to be installed and configured to allow &amp; net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all indicates and enables the setting of the network characteristics .
in most cases device drivers for network hardware and other devices will be installed at installation of &amp; lin@@ ux ; use network devices to be added later , the drivers must be loaded according to the following files , according to the kernel version :
the network settings will be loaded when the network settings are selected in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; index settings are tried . starting at the module network settings , this system will automatically detect the system automatically .
if the platform is not recognized , the spring selection will be offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and the release is best . by selecting the setup non @-@ again questions can be taken permanently . at the next start of the network settings , this selection will automatically default automatically .
changing the network settings are possible only in system management mode . before , all options are displayed , the settings can only be viewed , changing mode is not possible . in the system management mode , the input mode is required at the right lower end of the module . it is necessary to enter the password required .
in the management process mode the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three riders :
the rider network interfaces to manage the network devices of the system . all available network appliances are displayed . the following tasks are made :
the settings shown network interfaces can be set by selecting the desired device in the list and click of the button interface ... can be processed in the dialog button .
by default only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button Extended Settings menu displays the dialog with further options .
in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings are taken from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP servers . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP information is required for any system start , therefore no further adjustment required . in the selection list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
with selecting Manu@@ ally , without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be performed TCP / IP address . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as the characteristics of the device in the box list .
it should be ensured that the IP address will not already be used in the network . with ping in the &amp; console , you can determine whether the desired address is already used in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off . on @-@ off of a switched network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking on interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off . if a activated network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on interface ....
using the IP address of the host in local sub@@ net , which convey@@ s the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ networks .
if the computer is more than a network interface , the interface must be selected to the network where the Gateway computer is set to be selected .
a computer with DNS support is replaced by the respective IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the calcul@@ ator ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS resol@@ ves this name to an IP address such as approx . 12@@ 3,@@ 4@@ 5,@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator for the name @-@ resolution part of the equ@@ ator name solution enables simple administration of this list . entries can be added , remov@@ es or change wer@@ .@@ DNS entries can be ordered by selecting a entry and up or down@@ gra@@ dation in the list with buttons or down in priority .
by clicking the button add ... from the group computer to name resolution you can add a DNS server . it will add the new name server to the New Nam@@ es@@ erv@@ er .
first , you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button to add . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution you select an entry and then click on the button Edit .... It will be shown to the dialog .
the list of renowned computers describes the name @-@ to @-@ IP address mode for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily by bo@@ oting , if no DNS server is available . in small , closed networks can replace the DNS server .
normally the list of well @-@ known calcul@@ ator contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses support . this still available in the test version of IP should replace in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computer , and click Add .... The new dialog box will be displayed .
click on the name of the well @-@ known computer and click the Add button . if the known computer has several alias names , de button add several times and enter another alias name .
select an entry of a well @-@ known computer from the list and select Edit .... The dialog for Calcul@@ ator will be shown .
it may be one of the following tasks , then by clicking OK , the list of static hosts will be updated .
the settings of the network settings are not immediately effective in the system . in order to activate the changes , the following command must be reset .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of source file .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough when &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed .
the installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is simply downloading the rpm package and can be downloaded in one &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool with graphical user can be used as a package or the installation tool of its distribution .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but additionally the development plan will be required with libraries and other things .
this is recommended only experienced users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; net@@ work@@ conf ; use the following commands to comp@@ ile this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information on basic network technology will be discussed in the second , all by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; changing configuration files .
this area can not replace further knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endix only basic information on the integration of the PC in a small ( home - ) network convey@@ s .
currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP Version 4 ( IPv4 ) . IPv4 has never found large spread . from IPv6 it is expected to continue in the near future . this description is therefore focused on the widespread IPv4 .
one of the main information is the knowledge to as@@ sign IP address of a network interface . in strange networks , on &amp; eg ; workplace is the network administrator that will be able to address a valid IP address . in any case , the IP address can not be chosen as desired !
when creating a private small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected specifically for this purpose to avoid IP address data . the addresses from the table below are not re@@ directed on the Internet , hence its use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines are possible through setting a g@@ at@@ ew@@ ays .
for smaller networks , most addresses in the range from 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 is used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net mask usually is set to 255.@@ 255.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all computer participants are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.0 and 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own computer ) . the default route is required for the IP address .
the network address 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 is reserved for IP traffic in local own machine . normally , the address is assigned to 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 of its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
in this part there are the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes changed to DSL connections , so that it is not surprising when in case of active DSL connections , another content is defined there .
for &amp; SuSE ; is known that this file is sorted by scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand can be found .

&amp; dat ; is a back@@ ing program for tape drives based on t@@ ar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a band . the first goal was to create a surface for correct , selective un@@ pack . the second goal was the answer of a question that took my wife : how much longer does it take ?
before a tape can be used , it must be bound by &amp; dat ; this can be done in three ways :
&amp; dat ; go back to the band and reads the pre @-@ span of the band . recogn@@ ise &amp; dat ; the pro@@ vocation on the band will not be asked if the tape should be format@@ ted .
recogn@@ ise &amp; dat ; the ban on your table , if it is not found , you will be asked if the band index will be re@@ produced .
everything has gone smoothly , changing the symbol for the tape drive to show that the band is bound . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the volume of the belt can now be searched for the tape .
before the dis@@ closure of the ban@@ der , first the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to do this :
&amp; dat ; can be seen by a change of symbol for the band that the integration for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be rejected without risk .
before a volume of &amp; dat ; used , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; dat ; format@@ ted .
a band types must be format@@ ted before you want to be used to store data . this process does not need to be format@@ ted before using the tape using &amp; dat ; it needs to be format@@ ted before using the tape of &amp; k@@ dat ; form a form@@ att@@ ing of the tape ahead , D@@ AT drives are not being format@@ ted .
after entering the band named and the capacity goes &amp; dat ; with the form@@ att@@ ing of the band . all data on the band will be lost automatically ! after completion of the form@@ att@@ ing process the band is automatically bound and is ready to use .
before you encounter the backup process , you must select the files that can be secured . it can be done on three ways :
select a file or folder in local file size . only this file or folder is secured .
select a safety profile in the tree . only the files are secured in the profile .
select files in a local file tree with a shirt . only the selected files and / or sub @-@ folders are secured .
click with the right mouse button on the local file @-@ tree and select the pop @-@ in menu ...
once the backup was initiated , the dialog for backup . in this dialogue you can check out the selected files and change the settings for backup .
if you confirm the settings , the dialog box backup . the dialog will show the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only select the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archive in the entry for the band with a shirt . only the selected files and / or sub @-@ folders are checked .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry . ....
once the test procedure was launched , the dialog appears for review . in this dialogue you can check out your selection and change work@@ folder for review .
if you have confirmed the settings for review , the dialog appears to check out the progress of the test process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can create the Rest@@ ore , the files you need to be recovered . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub @-@ folders will be re@@ produced .
select the desired files from one of the archive with a her@@ esy . only the selected files and / or sub @-@ folders are recovered .
to open a file or folder in one of the archives and select a folder in one of the archives ....
once the recovery process was started , the dialog for Rest@@ oration . in this dialogue you can check out your selection and change the work@@ folder for restoration .
if you confirm the settings for the restoration , the dialog will restore Res@@ ell . this dialog shows the progress of recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it refers to be necessary to create the Band@@ inde@@ x@@ file using the band content . this procedure del@@ etes all existing index files for this volume . you can create the index on two types of the band :
this is a secure profile with just selected files and default settings . you can make the following settings for a secure profile :
the current sub@@ folder where the backup is to be done . the list of the files will be updated automatically according to the chosen work folder .
for all folders that are under backup files are valid that only the files are secured that are located on the same file system , like the folder . folders that are on other file systems , you can register separately under the backup files . each entry is considered t@@ ar independent of the other .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have been changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is secured that since then they have changed since .
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before calling from t@@ ar . this causes all files to be secured and created a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons are gt ; and lt ; lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creation this documentation .
the settings can be set via the menu option K@@ D@@ at ... in the menu settings . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device works for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path has to be transferred to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the belt device .
this setting is active , transmitted &amp; dat ; before the tape is bound to the drive . in some disk drives this is necessary , before read or write operations can be performed .
if the option is switched on , tries &amp; dat ; to lock the capture of tape drive . possibly , this setting does not work with all band drives .
if the option is enabled , the bond will be subjected to the integration of &amp; dat ; automatically cast out the tape . do not use this option on flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is enabled , tries &amp; dat ; not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you need &amp; dat ; in any case the block size for your tape drives are added .
when &amp; dat ; a band is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the band . this file should only contain one memory block on the band . the file data sets itself as follows :
( n byte ) The Band @-@ ID . the format of this string is hosts : seconds , with host@@ name the full name of the system is format@@ ted on which the band has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that has been format@@ ted since the ep@@ och in which the band has been format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the remaining files on the band are pure t@@ ar -@@ Archive which can manage directly with &amp; GNU ; - t@@ ar . even other t@@ ar versions should work , as long as it is not an incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
review the content of a backup tape . this symbol is only active if a volume is mounted .
&amp; ks@@ ach@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewing for system protocols . the program is available for in@@ experienced users , where you can get information on your system , or where the system allows users to access the system via your system , allowing users to access information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; Editor log ; helps users to understand what your computer is making in the background . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users , which can &apos;t know where you can get information about your system or where the system is deposited into the various protocol files .
furthermore , &amp; Editor log ; experienced users access the fast access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; ks@@ ellers log ; therefore , a few advanced functions have been trying to be filtered and evaluated by using the protocol files .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 contains &amp; ks@@ ellers log ; a number of useful features include amongst others :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other features are also included in addition , and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screenshot , &amp; ks@@ ellers log ; functions can easily be fil@@ tering and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file easily and sort them . the individual possibilities for sor@@ ting and filters are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after launching &amp; ks@@ ellers log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol , you will not appear , and it will not open a small message window , so you will not see with system administrator right . the protocol files are normally under Linux normally in the folder / var / log , for the normal user does not have any permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter out according to a limited range of crit@@ erion or according to the filter bar . in the default setting , select a log line next to the filter . then , a protocol line will only be displayed if in one of the columns , the filter search is included .
you can also select another entry in this location . the drawing of the filter search term is then used only with entries in the protocol file system . select the process of a process as shown in the filter bar the name of a process , so show you &amp; ks@@ ellers log ; all protocol lines sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in default settings and helps you to recogn@@ ise the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level error are displayed with a striking colour as protocol lines of level note . the color representation of protocol lines can be switched off .
would you like to display specific process ( for example , in the system protocol or in cr@@ on protocol ) , you can then be useful if you want to examine the output identification ( P@@ ID ) if you want to examine the output of a certain command as for example to the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case you will use filter bar .
furthermore , you can jump to the new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new protocol lines .
&amp; ks@@ ellers log ; enables you to open multiple protocol files into separate sub @-@ windows . to open this function , use the entries in the menu window to open additional signatures . once you have selected a window , select a protocol to display .
&amp; ks@@ eway log ; has a dedicated website to ht@@ t@@ p : / / ks@@ system log@@ .@@ forum @-@ sof@@ tw@@ are@@ .@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find further current information about the source of &amp; ks@@ ach@@ log ; .
&amp; ks@@ log log , you will also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archives : ks@@ system log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; this section leads some concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ;
the V In@@ it has quickly evolved into the standard for control of the system start at the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it .
I &apos;m not going to go on historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is below / s@@ ist and not under / etc . this is therefore important because someone might try to implement a machine on system V in@@ it without a new installation and new format . that &apos;s why you will need to make sure the old In@@ it was removed from there , if there was one there .
the SY@@ SV In@@ it diff@@ ers from BSD In@@ it , that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder / etc are instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d. D@@ ort you find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole amount scripts . basically , you require a script for each system service , which you want to start at the high @-@ level system . system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , ht@@ t@@ p@@ d &amp; etc . system services include such things such as set@@ serial serial that will only be started . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should lie down under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you require it . most of the systems have this file , even if it does not have much use for this . you can also use a r@@ c.@@ serial / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port .
the kernel is looking for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first to take it .
the standard run@@ level is in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . in the initial area you should see line like the following :
at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably determine that the default , you can change / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab by hand and change the 3 . if you can change anything , then you &apos;ll fix it by using the system and run the following :
but how does it start to enter all the right scripts ? if you enter -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you will probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how starts and stops in@@ it ? very simple : each of scripts is so written that there is an argument like start and stop . you can actually start this scripts actually from hand on the command line as follows :
this would keep the ht@@ t@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the K comprises , the script will be called with the argument . if it includes a S , the script will start with the argument start .
some people desire a simple way to set machines for many purposes . I might have ht@@ t@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . in addition , I could also have a user Run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc .
here you can learn the use of &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was so user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is simple to say not to say : simply drag an entry from the area of availability to one of the six rounds to start it at this level ( or stop ) .
you can also change scripts , or change the position within a level by changing it . thereby , the entry is removed from its original run@@ level ( or its position ) . this happens only if they will extract a entry in the area of availability .
note : entries will be post@@ pon@@ ed if you want to copy this into a new run@@ level , you need to select copy from the menu click here or from the context menu -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target range of the action .
the sor@@ ting number of an entry can sometimes be calculated sometimes . in such a case you have to process the sor@@ ting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try to insert the system service .
note : there is no possibility to restore entries that were thrown into the tr@@ ash tr@@ ash . be careful .
you can use the tab button to activate the different working areas ( availability , run@@ level 1 stop , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc . ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection of top or below the previous one .
to move one entry into another round level , move it with cut into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sor@@ ting number or the name of an entry manually , press the input button to switch between different fields . connect the tab button to accept the changes in order to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to dis@@ card the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are taken in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / ks@@ ys@@ v@@ r@@ c . pre@@ ferences will be taken from &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v . otherwise they will be re@@ produced by &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v . changes to the default settings are stored in a local ks@@ ys@@ v@@ r@@ c .
I have to experiment with the standard Run@@ lev@@ eling , and now the machine is re@@ structured . what can I do ?
enter the L@@ ILO -@@ Pro@@ m@@ pt lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single use mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be OK ) .
I have some system services with &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; available at run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; SuSE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only present in these distri@@ butions . please read more details in the manual of the distribution .
the type , such as system services are started in these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard simpli@@ fies for the propri@@ etary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using another distribution : please check if all configuration files are needed ( and even if they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ t@@ p@@ d ) are simply without message if your configuration files are not available or wrong .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , may even be different from version to version differently . if you use a different distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level , so that this manual can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; user ; it is sufficient to read Chapter adjustment of &amp; k@@ user ; read .
after having made changes you have to save it . either use the corresponding symbol of the tool@@ bar or the entry saving in the menu file .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two cartridge card , user and user groups . for processing , choose the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog &apos;s user or group characteristics .
some cartridge card will only be displayed if you have extended system settings . only if you can specify a card card , if you can change individual settings , if shadow -@@ pass@@ words or e.g. / etc / master pass@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d may be installed as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes .
the card information is released , if shadow pass@@ words or e.g. / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d is installed as in BSD -@@ Uni@@ xes .
this card card appears only if for at least a embedded file system of limitation ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( visible on the file rates quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , for every user parameters , the limited restrictions in KB are :
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected using the field of fil@@ esystem with space limit
the card groups informs about the groups of the selected user . the standard group , to which the user is heard , you will find in the field of Pri@@ m@@ ary Group . furthermore , the user can be a member in other groups by selecting this in the large field .
the dialog characteristics of the Group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select adding from the menu or group or click on the matching add button of the tool@@ bar . the processing or del@@ eting of the selected user or the selected group works analogue .
with this module you can install the L@@ ILO boot manager , remove the boot order , remove and change the time to boot of the standard operating system , remove the standard operating system , add , modify , change operating systems , change and more .
