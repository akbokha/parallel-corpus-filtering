<seg id="75">& digiplug; used the program gPhoto2 for communication with digital cameras, which has been developed continuously increasing numbers of over 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, which has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images of digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos in general files are obsolete and transfers via the serial port are slowly. & digiplug; supports these cameras and leads the transmission of the images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>

<seg id="150">The first thing you will do and know before you want to be organized into your system, the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. you must decide whether other access to your photos should be saved or on a network drive & etc. make sure you need to move on a larger drive.</seg>
<seg id="151">Perhaps you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly about your location. if you have enough photos, then you will use subfolder as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export is then a folder for images which print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, work processes, constant supply of pictures to different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% Archive and 5% work files and you will not want to organize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">Which types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the stack-processing easier. do new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and operating files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are searching for an original or a derived picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend to activate the metadata option in the installation page of the metadata in & digiplug; this ensures that Exif- and IPTC data will be written in the file. if you forget, you can then select the metadata from the database in the files by clicking the corresponding point in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change it? with it & digiplug it is a metadata editor for a number of selected attribute. these are of course the most important.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work, since you should select every photo keyword, and you should select all the images that will need the same attribute if you start with the same attribute. this makes sense when you can concentrate on top of the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now touch with keyword, keywords, such as you are often hot in other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import cataloged images from another source of embedded sample, then add & digiplug; automatically add the tree to you and can be easily done by the drag of a sub-tree to another. they will be updated by & digiplug; updated while there are undertrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graph shows how different metadata. this is a very rough representation, since each block of metadata in truth consist of many sections. data names and calendar data features all pictures.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of words - the next section refers to labelling or comments using the third important tool to katalogise your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You want to leave most niemakers your photos just, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. they are certainly interested in how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance there is not even a nice beach panorama. if you are closer to view, then catch some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say that this is the landing area of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. Wow! one begins to dream associations, memories, the historical period of time is again present, you may even hear the silence. so the labels has been changed completely.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who consider your photos can be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you are showing pictures you should tell a story. think the key is the meaning of the viewer to help Him. help you understand what you understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is OK when an image is not perfect, if it has the strength only with a label for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digiplug; you can also use a much text in an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8), then you can export to your images in web galleries, then you will tell you a second time in web galleries. you need to tell the story so for the opening of the web site.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find in another city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet before Google Earth? good, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now already with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities for geolocalisation are already innumerable and will be able to open a deeper place in the future, and can also be able to open your journeys using Google Earth. you can also show the photos at reception location. you can also show the pictures at reception location. you can also export the pictures even to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc. you can export to Google Earth viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a vocabulary with copyright and signifies the practice of copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all amended versions, i.e. also for the work of other.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description says you what information is on the installation page of & digiplug; as information should be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for Eritioner and Writer): this field should contain your name, or the name of the photographer, for example, if it was not desired to be the name of the photographer, then it should not be changed. after this value, it should not be changed. this field does not support semmas nor Semikolons as a partition.</seg>
<seg id="173">Autortitel (synonym for author): linked to the author. this field contains the work name of the photographer. examples of this field can be title as: employee photographer, Free photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a merk to the car field, this also has to be filled out.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (Synonym for providers): do not use the memory card to identify the photo. if the photographer is responsible for a message such as Reuters or Associated Press, you can do this organizations here. if the picture is a storage photo, then the Group / Agency will offer this picture here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they have no more protection against misuse. anyone who have a little more than basic know in work with calculator, these are digital watermarks. for individuals, this is important for the majority of your photos only of low interest. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique. & digiplug is unique. & digiplug; is available in the near future, such a module for stacker processing.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: turntables, plate, power supply, ECC, transmission error, ageing of storage media, recovery, redundancy, disinformation, life time, temperature, data size, widespread itions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we don't talk about CDs that were lost on the road or a fire. these kind of losses are the same which can happen to you with traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section there are problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the largest data recovery company in the world, has some interesting statistics which has the reasons for data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs they must be treated, and you may not have any longer than a few years. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality. there are offers over gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 that have a lifetime of 100 years for yourself. whether you believe it is in your discreetrack.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can use this risk in which you can use good disks and good recording devices. the best DVD recording devices are not much more reliable than the cheapest way, but you are much reliable. it turns out to select the right.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable for mistakes, even if you have just been written only. therefore, they use a control system to protect themselves. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for the formatting and the control sums. despite these massive protection words they are required by chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs there is a reasonable program called IsoBuster, which runs on Windows and & Linux, but is not available for Macs. there are also similar applications the damaged data of damaged disks, hard disks, Flashmedia, USB drives etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray Disks seem to save the format of DVD to HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disk can store 50 GB and therefore almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. everything was said to CD and DVDs, of course also for the Blu-ray disk.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good capture device to high-quality media in a non-proprietary format. read the media with a description, date & author label and then place on a clean, dark dry and locally protected site. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest hardware or software that this media can read.</seg>
<seg id="186">Floppy disk provides your statistics for themselves. their manufacturers guarantee a new disk, but not the data. Google presents a large field study about the error mechanisms of hard drives available: dismissican</seg>
<seg id="187">In brief: disks keep the trouble when you are operated in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. some of SMART could not notice the error. some of SMART could terminate the error. these are particularly reading and publishing signs. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is a complete loss due to overvoltage due to overvoltage. of course, you can also have data loss due to a current account before you have secured the files, but this losses can normally be expanded without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices are not much account, these can take heavy damage. at your computer, these anomalies can cause severe loss of data loss, complete data loss, destroyed motherboards and other defects. protect themselves before the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">Most popular protection against electricity peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that a part of the energy seats absorbs and the rest. it is usually in the form of a plug-in strip. remember that not each plug-in strip contains a overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should pay attention to the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a specific minimum of protection. you should also make sure that it protects protection against flash and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage can be connected to your computer, you should also make sure that all peripherals are connected to your system. some manufacturers can also include overvoltage socket which also include a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modems and the TV map.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specifically designed for notebooks and therefore also contain the protection for the modem. so you are ideal for travelling.</seg>
<seg id="194">While a overvoltage protection of your system is used in the power lines, it will not really help you. even a few seconds can lead to the loss of adverse data. it can therefore be meaningful in an uninterruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protection against overtensions, these devices can automatically store your data. this gives you the possibility of converting your data. if you have a USV, you should be sure that they are the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the enclosed software can be interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk to avoid your computer system, and compare his safety for current dysfunction with the cost to avoid this. a high quality overvoltage protection can be used for less than & euro; 40. this is only a small price difference if you think, you should always remember all the cable before you go into the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - easy storage service. with the right configuration, you can use it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular range with you to save any quantity of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are very expensive compared to the hard drives, however very expensive - 40 GB costs & dollar, 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollar; 500. in addition, you need to send the data about comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">Solutions are therefore suitable as a solution for a local data loss of the most important pictures. it is not a bad solution but it is not a general backup solution. it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com are available online. its professional variant is not available in full resolution online. the professional variant is more available to you in case of Flickr dramatically. for $25 per year you will receive unlimited memory, which should be reviewed in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup, the web solutions are very safe. transfer errors will be automatically included, thanks to the TCP protocol, and with the big companies it is included in the offer a backup and a partial storage.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the calculator. all transmissions are due to transmission errors. the filesystem zfs and btrfs ensure the data integral between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that nobody says when a transmission error occurred. all this disturbances remain unspotted until you have destroyed during your surprise. nobody seems to have been thinking about it. nobody seems to have thought about it. nobody seems to have been thinking about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much more reliable data way than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are a further source of transmission losses, since they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not affected by transfers problems you should see in the future. as early as 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS by Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it is available soon for & Linux; and Windows is available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched an own initiative with its btrfs system. it is still in the Alpha status. it uses the same protective mechanisms that uses zfs and is also available for & Linux; but it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Underestimate that these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss in notebook and 46% at the workplace systems. in case of notebooks, the proportion of theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less widespread than most. it leads to a lower damage, as such as theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & linux; no longer has been observed.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the common file systems. you can find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during one operation is higher and a definite status is avoided before the problem occurred, she is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings of fundamental physical limits. it is meant that the technology continues to develop a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and roughts characteristic for all types of light sensors are not far away from this border.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixels sensors. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the final result more deteriorate. a sensor size of 6 Megapixel and a high-quality optics are the optimisation for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have a full format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard drive are available today for 100 & euro; so do not make any data loss for data loss. make your data often come after a plan and test this backup before using any risk as the new installation of your operating system, replacing records or the size of the hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backups on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash, you are lucky if the drive was not connected to the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A Desaster proposes locally and destroys a lot. do not forget by plane, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, Descriptions always means non-local storage. bring your backups up to the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of the physical separation: as above already said is a common reason for data loss despite backup the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all the files will be secured. it is a moment recording without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differentiation: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup has been changed. generates a complete torque at two time points: the complete insurance policy and the latest differential backup.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of files that have been changed since the last backup. you can restore the original status to any time again. this backup comes to a versioning system at the next with the exception that it is only disgeted and not continuing.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful tool which can easily copy to your machines. unlike a script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transmissions. this happens only the difference of files that really changed. this happens when you want to increase safety over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure important pictures directly after you saved them on your computer on a DVD or another optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach lets you need enough time to discover losses and restore. at the end, you will have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly moment of performance for at least one month and a moment intake for every month. each additional thinner should be manually taken after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in image file, IPTC information, associated XMP files, original store, storage, scalability, media, relocate pictures and metadata, copy the images onto the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual equipment,..., using the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">To survive valuable pictures the next 40 year, that is about the period in which you really interested in you because they should remember your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unforeseeable, you must look at all this day. unfortunately, there is no other way to manage. unfortunately, there is no other way to manage. all 5-8 years should ask oneself like the current system backward. if less variants you have used in the past, it is easier to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. if you have an old system that is important for reading your images, then store it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and backing technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to a newer standard. continue with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist printing for the possibility to change a system in its size. it actually means to enlarge.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's go out that you have the scalability with inplanning and the area you want to zoom on a dedicated table or partition. at * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this range and transfer to a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check out with the command dmesg whether your new record was detected by the system, but do not depend on it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& / dev / SDB / dev / SDB, the new record is / dev / SDC # Source: / dev / SDC / SDC # Source can be / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the plate in MBgt; # works with ext2.3, FAT16, 32 and ReiserFS & dollar; resize2fs / dev / fried c1 # change the size of ReiserFS if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open Source Standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if a day no software can be read, then you can create this itself. this task is easier for year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format which disappears slowly from the market. so you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard, but it can be much more. it is loss freely, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit pro color channel and full transparency. it is that there is relative many administration information, but not as many as TIFF and a slow compression. this format would like to save you to save your images.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widespread as image format. TIFF can store images in high quality, but requires very large files. with some cameras, you can customize your images in this format. a problem is however that this format has been adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital negatives file format is a licensed and open shell format that has been developed by Adobe Systems. DNG is based on the TIFF / EP format and is required to use Metadata. a handful camera manufacturer DNG is now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is probably one of the reasons why to replace the XMP technology for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is an important label technology that allows users to enter your data into a file itself. the file information are stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; saved the XML / RDF file.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers draw it before an original size of your recording, mostly in the raw format, it can be archived from the image file. however, however, it can be used separately from the link between the metadatendatei and the image file and as above mentioned, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization that support itself for fully compatible online metadatboards, which support a wide range of application areas and modelling, discussions and collective work in the DCMI communities, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and explaining efforts to achieve a widespread acceptance of metadatboards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images of the camera, the card reader or scanner. as long as the pictures are on the camera line, you can use it as temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your shell archive. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine-layer processing you can use external programs. if you have the pictures again with & digiplug; edit, then you should add the metadata again. these were cut under circumstances from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for the copyright with a digital watermark. export you only in Webgaleries, encode in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc.</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos into & digiplug; in the section of adding photos you can have already on your hard drive, but the camera interface will provide you many advanced settings for importing images to your Albendatenbank.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; connect these to the computer to switch off the camera to the display mode and switch them. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, they try to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a pigmented indicator will be displayed on the camera. if this is the case, the filename and a symbol for file mapping will be displayed on the camera, photos, movies, music, etc.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you can download the photos on your computer, you may need to install the camera information on each entry. with the page afford characteristics and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the characteristics of an entry or his metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and the photo information that can be saved from the camera. a symbol indicates that the picture has not been downloaded from your computer. please note that some digital cameras do not have any information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider Metadata shows the internal metadata such as EXIF, manufacturer remarks, GPS, etc. this information is the same as the metadata sidebar from the main window of & digiplug; or the image processing. note that these metadata are not available at some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer, is the click on the button to download and then download the photos from their camera to a single album in & digiplug; if the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures have been downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, you can only select the desired cards selected by & kde; if you choose the photos selected, use the button to download and then selected selected. download the button as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option is available for download. these pictures have been downloaded from & digiplug; download the new pictures featuring a star in advance window. if you choose this option, only the new pictures are downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you are using the buttons all download or selected, a dialog appears where you can select the target album, displayed in which the photos are listed below. the list of existing albums can be shown in section my albums. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you select the target album, press OK, and & digiplug; the photos of the camera invites you to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos you can delete this from the camera. you can delete all of them to delete all. if you want to delete all, you need to delete this first and delete it later.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there are no possibility to recover from the camera. you should not check if the photos are successful in a & digiplug; it should be carefully deleted if you want to erase them from the camera. if you want to delete it from the camera, you should make it much faster than the camera's camera.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as filename for the photos often not particularly meaningful names. this can be automatically deleted after the photos from the camera. this can be meaningful, the date and the time that the image has been taken to integrate into the filenames.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for turning and mirrors of the image and for file-based underside. if you use this latter option, you will automatically create a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options during the transfer will open three more options before the photos are stored on the record. if you select this, the respective entries are copied from the EXIF fields in the IPTC fields. with the latest option you can correct the date & time for all downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you wish to use another type format as the standard format, you can use the prefix photo -% Y-% -% d% H:% M:% S. turn the option date & time. for further adjustments, you should read the help of the command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera filename option, you have the option to change the file names in lowercase. or in case letters if you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the & digiplug; used for a photo, will be displayed below the name, which is displayed in preview. your settings are stored and automatically used if you can open the camera windows.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digiplug; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to be used to implement a automatic rotation during shutdown. not all cameras do this information. in the section sidebar metadata, you can also read more details about the information that your camera is embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is normally switched on, and if your camera doesn't deliver & digiplug; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to switch the automatic rotation, use the button Extended and select the automatic rotation within the lower range of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera has been made information about the date, at which the photo is made, can be used & digiplug. all images with the same date are based on the same subalbum. not all cameras are available in the same subalbum. not all cameras can be viewed in the same subalbum. in the section sidebar Meta Data you can read what informations could be embedded into the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally switched off, and in this case stores & digiplug; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this option, use the button Extended and select the option-based subalben at the bottom end of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to download photos from their computer to your camera is so download. select the file selection dialog & kde; in which you can select the files that should be uploaded instantly. you can also choose more than a file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the picture selection is, asks & digiplug; you, where the images will be high. select the desired folder for the camera. select here the desired folder and press OK to start the upload. the images are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this is a position which can be displayed in longitude and latitude, which can be displayed on a map. the data can be performed from the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers, it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographic place. not everyone uses a plane to create an area through automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planner, military, police, architecture office and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you forgot later, where exactly the photo was done you can open a browser that shows the area. if you want to locate a postcard to another & digiplug; user would like to locate to localize the place of photos, it is good to record the position data of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how to get the GPS data in the picture? first you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data areas, such as the data in these fields? there are at least three ways to reach this. directly with the right hardware, via a reprocessing of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module to the geographic assignment (manual) and last about the manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has a GPS unit. but there is a few to work with GPS recipients. either as a map module or via transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>

<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset back by pressing the button on the right from each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the luminance of & digiplug; can be set on this page on the default values. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is then not available. the option & quot; In the entire image size ladenquot; if you have one, then you can obtain better visibility results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, the image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can switch this here. you can switch the toolbar if you use the image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Overand exposed areas of a picture can be marked with dark or brighter color in the picture. these colors are specified here. in the image processing this picture can be switched on with F10 and F11 and switched off.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma subsampling is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance as in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia on this explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With setting PNG compression you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality, since PNG requires any loss algorithm. if you have a quick computer, you can set this value to high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the TIFF option, you can compress the Deflate compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it does not have any influence on the image quality as the Deflate algorithm uses loss.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the setting-free JPEG 2000 files you can save your loss. even if you were able to save the loss setting, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than at normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata was not yet supported, but was in planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the earlier versions of & digiplug; the image processing was just a picture viewer for photos. currently, it has been developed very quickly to manipulation of your photos. with this dialogue you can change the settings of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default content is that all green pixels are equal to ultraviolet light than the pixels at odd lines, this difference is a bit soft, eliminates the picture with a minimum loss of details. this option shows the picture a bit soft, eliminates the 2x2 Gitterpatterns with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">When this option is set, the white-off of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white is not reset. default is it a fixed color balance which was photographed on a white card which was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. the use of the second sensors has the effect that exposed to exposed images in four steps more details in the peak lights. for other cameras this option will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the top, so the parts of your images should be embedded in the settings, because of the inability of your camera. using some unusual results since it shows the peak beam in various roses. most recently, you can try some parts of the missing information from the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general is not as fast as green and red. & dcw are therefore trying to reconstruct the missing green and red proportions from the still not saturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question, how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option, you will get the option to set a level. here's a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted individually for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the Luminant value after your taste. you must probably set it somewhat higher than the standard 1. this can also be done later in the image options of & digiplug; -image processing are made. in order to hold time for the Demosaeval small, you should be conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demo process is a digital image process to obtain a complete image from the particle measurement data, which provides many cameras and the matrix color pixels is available. this algorithm is also known as an CFA-interpolation or color construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digiplug; and Dcw provide you three alternatives to your disposal: Bilinear, VNG-Interpolation and AHD interpolation (for Adaptive Homogeneity). after some tests it was produced such as AHD interpolation (for Adaptive Homogenesis). however, this creates color order to the edges. Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color softening of your lenses, you can place the rotor and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for a color correction, as you are carried out during the shell conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions like this again. there are also LCMS and & digiplug; information like the color information from a color space in the others are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Ask if a painting is opened in image processing / colour management module with shell files.</seg>
<seg id="314">For example, click here the file, such as / usr / share / Color / ICC or / home / Color / ICC, in which you store all your profiles. & digiplug; this file examines during the start.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of the ICC Profile you have the possibility & quot; standard squot; for your profiles to be paid. everything can be changed when opening the shell file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The screen saver view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here only your pictures are not managed on the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should be able to fit the camera manufacturer and model you can fit. there are some, such as Canon, which do not contain dtoners or gammacorrection. currently, dcw Gamma is not corrected for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to perform the color mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options such as the Soft Proof-Profile, which you can emulate the picture from one device. this is very useful before you can print a smaller colour range than your camera and some colors are so very saturated. this could be manually correct, rather than to rely on the blind algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is quite obviously what colour profile is planned for them. unfortunately, not in the models of Canon. unfortunately, here is a table of cameras and profiles together. this answer is naturally unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile expansion leaves the style for the destination: F for an accurate style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for Portraitund S for the standard style.</seg>

<seg id="337">& digiplug; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools. you can use these to view your photos and to improve your photos and improve image processing through a click with the left mouse button to preview of a picture or through the context menu of preview and selection of the entry advertisement / editing.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of these are available as modules in & digiplug; for example, you are not part of your distribution. more information on the KIPI modules are available in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status parts at the bottom edge of the window, the filename, current data number, magnification factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top edge and including the tool bar for fast access to the most common functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The processing functions of image processing captures your photos. however, no of functions will change the original photo, before you can use Save or the button Save from the toolbar. note that you can't recover the original photo, as soon as you have stored the picture.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should add a copy of your image before you change it. you can Save the Save as a file.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can reproduce the original image by creating the image processing of the image processing in the toolbar. you will then lose any change you have been carried out at the photo since the last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost any action of image processing can be back or re-manufactured. the last action can make you back, by processing your work back or re-produced by select Edit menu from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you often use it, you should make the key shortcut, Ctrl; -z to reboot and Ctrl; -Shift Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you choose the & LMB; check back button in the toolbar a moment longer, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions are made between also back and re-manufactured.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the image processing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, picture high, picture, or the entries in the menu file, you will be asked if you want to save these.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can also get in the photo and zooming in which you can use Ctrl; Mausrad, or the symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the insured menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To customize a picture to the window size you can use this button in the toolbar: choose the magnification factor</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode shows the picture in full screen mode. if you do not want to use the toolbar. if you do not want to change this in the installation dialog of & digiplug; you can also call this in the installation dialog of & digiplug; you can see this from the & digiplug; see the section to set the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can select a picture in the menu file and get the standard & kde; print dialog. you can adjust the settings before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual pictures or whole phrases. all of the images can choose from your selection. you only need to select the images with the default methods and select from the menu album exporting print assistant. if you follow the assistant, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digiplug; main window has a sidebar at the right edge, which provides important information and promotions for selected images. the same sidebar is available without the navigation components, even in image processing. it will be displayed if one of the five riders is clicked on:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple Click on the same tab, the sidebar will disappear or disappear in the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the labelling view, you can enter labels with unlimited size or add. note that the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed to be used in the EXIF- and IPTC- fields that you can use other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated to 2000 characters and special characters are changed. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should notice that limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you commented on, you can either use the button and switch to the next image, the labelling are saved then.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the user button there is a button More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also choose the metadata to the files. however, this will always be done if you have a metadata setting, which will always be written into the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The section assessment shows an evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the scanning shortcut of Ctrl + 0... 5. in order to evaluate multiple pictures simultaneously, select this from and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written into the IPTC field. the coding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keyword, the keyword tree and a selection box with the previously mentioned in this & digiplug; -Session canned.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word. you can quickly restrict the number of possibilities in search for a keyword. this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is a further relief on the input of sample files at a picture series. if you have entered different words, these are stored for fast access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Passwords can also be set through check boxes in the tree. all tags of an image are stored in the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several pictures are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree, this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection, if you want a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The side bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. normally, the left sidebar will be used with their album, - data, keyword and viewpoints. if in addition, one or more keyword filter will be used from the right side, only the cut quantity of these two are displayed. all words created are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag tags and lay down. if the keyword exists, you can simply drag them from the right side bar and put it on the selection. then a dialog when you ask if you want to set up the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the pictures on one calendar day. the keyword filter is found on no words which reduces the quantity to three images. they were drawn with Ctrl + a, and then a keyword should be drawn from the right-up tree to the selection and taken there. a dialog asks whether this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes will be held at any start of the program. you can also be switched on different settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and determine that it would have one or be, you can easily change this with a double-click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry in which the database is sought. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or string, which is already in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can define an Extended search for all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to grouping options, you only need the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button in the button. see the options as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed below? the free disk space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>

<seg id="377">The reason why you have a color-administered workflow is that the colors come from your camera or scanner, you can achieve a predictable deviation from your camera or scanner. with a colored workflow you can reach the colors on your monitor using your camera or scanner at the same and the colors they print or in the web, to which you can print out of your digital dark chamber.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the topic is on color administration then you would like to press the buttons. unfortunately, color administration means that you inform you adequate information about color management at each point of image processing work. in addition, links with deeper information allow you to make your own informative decisions to make you the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workings meets all six criteria listed below, you don't need to worry about color administration.</seg>
<seg id="380">They are working on a monitor that is calibrated on the RGB colour space. (see below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image expenditures are by e-mail or web, where sRGB of the de-facto standard is standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB does so good work and life for everyone so easy, why should I use another color space and make the thoughts about color spoilt?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB compared to the colors which we really can see is shown below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors which we can see, the hufeisenular region, and the colours in the RGB color space, the triangular area.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger farms, visit Bruce Lindblooms, and then click on info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to meet my monitor when I decided to work only in the RGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you work in the RGB colour space or not, you need to keep your monitor kallibrimm. so, if you are working as a color space of sRGB, you need to use either your monitor on the RGB standard kallibrieren, a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections to improve one picture in most cases. use it before you try to pass a further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, abstained, Automatic and contrast expand from the menu. automatically correcting your colors the best. they will have to experiment with these effects, to see what works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled up the entire picture, so that the darkest point black and the brightest point as bright as possible, without changing its colour casings. this function is often a stomach correction for images that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">Equivalent: this method adjusts the luminosity factor of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity is as flat as possible. sometimes, the same very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only garbage. it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracles by a picture or destroyed it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic abnormalities: this method maximizes the colour range in red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright border ones and adjusted the rotor, green and blue channels at the complete histogrammar.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast extend: this method improves the contrast and the luminosity of the RGB values of an image through the one of the lowest and highest values on the maximum possible range and a new jiusting of all values. this is only visible with balanced pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digiplug is a semi-automated tool to perform the white balance of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-equal correction is slightly limited since a colour space is done with 8-bit per color. if you are able to perform the white compensation in the raw mode, which is working in 16-bit mode, so your possibilities for correction are better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm of protected by Pawel T. Jochym. they start it with the menu entry colors white as the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adapted in size. on the left you can see both the original image as well as the preview of the target image. the preview will be dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original whitish, it is enough to view the window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview photos shows a red marker. the Luminance of the Pixels under this marker is displayed as vertical line in histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">On the right, a histogram appears that dynamically changed, as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, most Pixel very small luminance values. with a button you can choose whether one of the three colors or your sum will appear. the sum will be called luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and Gamma. the shadows is adjustable you can improve the shadow details of your photos or also down.</seg>
<seg id="401">Anstat with the above controls performed, you should use the color temperature pipette. press on this button and then use anywhere to use the color temperature for calculating the colour temperature of white. on this type, the temperature and green values are automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposed level dictator increases the colors when more than a color channel of Pixels are overexposed. this is shown in preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons Save as and shop do exactly this. each setting of the white balance you have set you can store this in a text file and later reload.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button preferences will return all filter values again on their standard values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that also neutral settings will result in another photo as your original. if you save that, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the coefficients per color channel of the machined image. 8-bit coding is better suited for high quality images. however, this coding needs even more disk space, calculating time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialogue as the processing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiled. color-mapping can be performed through the subwindow for the usage of color profiling allows you to rate the chapter of color administration.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu below colors. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust and allows you to use these for multiple photos. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner will always make the same errors and you always need the same correction. in the manual you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility of exposure problems to correct is the tool for gradation, that you can find under colors Gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digiplug; tools Farbeffective sets you four farms, a solar effect effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and an edge filters.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, a effect that emerged when they were partially inverted with a short light. the result was a partial negatively of the image. the result was a partial negatively of the picture. this tool allows you to fine this interesting effect.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar panel. at approx. 50% intensity the picture shows what is chemically possible. a further increase is finally a negative image that is not possible to generate photo paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar effect. the original picture is the (1) and the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation, that he makes a stronger contrast effect that makes the colours brilliant and brilliant. try it simply, it embellished many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an optimized color film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thereby a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvet. Velvet. Velvias strongly saturated colors are also some photographs, especially those who are hardly landscapes to do.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neonfilter simulates neonlight on the contrasts. the parameter level controls the brightness of the results and the slider repetitions the strength of the Neonlichts. at large images the filter can be extended the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusually that you want to change the color contrast of your photos with the tools in the menu below colors. once you are satisfied with the result. once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo of bad light conditions you can get the reverse problem. even in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation guarantee a good choice for brightness instead of increasing them. all changes you can see in preview. if the result you can do the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool Gradation and the simple Leuchase / contrast / Gamma is the tool sound correction to improve the exposure. even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated, you will need only the range of slides for this tool. specifically, the three slider below the histodate.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains an indication of the intensity values, a histogram, the active canals or the selected area. under the graph, three slider can be clicked on the picture to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn operation is to move the knob and move on it as the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right side, the original and preview of the picture can be viewed. the preview will be dynamic, based on the settings of the image, updated. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box can be set if the histogram is dominated by a linear or logarithmic y axis. in pictures the large areas of a constant color is dominated by a single pillar. in this case the logarithmic classification is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controllers: the top for dark tones, the middle for bright tones, and the bottom for the middle tones, often called Gammavalues.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pin pettes can be used in preview of the original image to adjust the input values of the shade, medium and bright tones automatically. furthermore, there is a button for a fully automatic alignment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection values for each area. there are also two regulators that can be used to change the output values e.g. in the input values. the compression of the output values can be used as a background, while something different in the foreground is to be used.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: this knob will automatically set the images automatically depending on the image values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save and load: with these buttons, the set values can be saved in the file system and later recharged. in addition, Gimp levels format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you are using this mode and the three color pipette, the input values will be automatically adjusted for all shadows, medium and solar sounds. activate the color pette to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">This option provides overexposed pixels, to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect on the preview only and it's not a effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example of the adjustment of input values to the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected picture (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left side, half of the original and the target image will be displayed dynamic, depending on your settings. on the right side the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modification channel: this selection box allows the channel to be changed from the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box, there are two symbols to change between a linear and logarithmic view. for images that were recorded with a digital camera, linear mode produces a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a short valves to the right, for example, bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones are correspondent and the corresponding picture pixel are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red mark. if you want to change this marking on the curve, the right curve is displayed on the curve, which is the original value. create a point on this line and move it on and off until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save and load: with these buttons, you can do exactly this. every curve you can create this file system and later reloaded in the file system and later the file format is Gimp cursor format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you are using this method and the three color pipettes buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shattens, medium and sun tones. activate the color pipette which you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminescence curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option overexposed overexposed pixels will be found to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels, you get the combined result. this is an indicator that is only shown in preview and it's not a effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-white photo that was corrected in the luminance channel. shadows and sun sound was used with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of & digiplug; image processing is a tool to improve the colour channels or change the shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The Channel Mixer is another highly developed tool to mix colour shades of pictures. you can edit it from the menu color mixer of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first note how to correct the channels by taking the relative distribution and impact. the left area of the window shows you a preview of. the original can be viewed with the own riders.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red markers. if you are positioned in picture below, a vertical line appears in histogram to display the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are on the right below: knob for red, green and construction allow you to change these channels. if you want to activate the respective color component, this is especially convenient, when the Channel Mixer is using DAS tool for creating great black-white conversions from your photos. try the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially if you can mix monochrome, the reduction of a color comes to a visible noise that comes from colourless. colourless consists of small crayons to appear in each channel. if that is the case you can improve your monochrome conversion in which you need to reduce the colourless first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save as and load buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any mixer setting can be saved for later and then load. that used file format is the Gimp-mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">This option provides overexposed pixels, to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect on the preview only and it's not a effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was re-adjusted. the original image is enabled (1) and the picture was shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / White-photography was always fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white a work step, as colour images can be easily converted to the computer. also with a set of film roller profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green linear filter. this looks good, with all scenarios and fits very well to Portraits of the sky. similar to the 004 Cokin (TM) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filters: simulates a black / white film exposure with a orange linear filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos. similar to the 002 Cokin (TM) orange filter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotational filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red line filter. this creates dramatic celist effects and can simulate lunches to day time. similar to the 003 Cokin (TM) Rotate filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellowfilter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow linear filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thereby similar to 001 Cokin (TM) yellowfilter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: this creates warm bright and medium sounds whilst he adds a little cold in the shading of a pressure and the development in a Sepiatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to 005 Cokin (TM) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Using & digiplug; mould texture can apply decorative textures on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless whether it is a color image or not, you can look like an oil painting on a screen, the Stich of an old master, a pop kind of portrait of enlarged points or like a wall picture on a wall. the menu entry of the image processing can be used for this.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: postpone this parameter increases to the right or three dimensional stability of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text surface is applied on the photo below. the original photo is (1) and the modified (2). the relief parameter was placed on 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">A decorative frame can be added with the & digiplug; tool frame can be added to an image.</seg>
<seg id="462">The eye of an observation to keep the limits of a photos is no easy task. a possibility to maintain a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier to the scattered eye. under the frame the module can be started under image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image. we move it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-white pictures), kantet sedet it with a nice three-dimensional frame of the ideal solution for a buttonhole and decoratively adds a decorative frame with pattern.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: the width of the frame is in percent. the range for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">This will be bigger than the original, but the original aspect ratio is greater than the original but the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool After aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can easily insert a formatted text in any picture at any spot. this also goes to several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply use the text and place it with the mouse. using the text, the larger must be the character set. at the end, simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background. already the picture is finished.</seg>
<seg id="468">Each setting which you have chosen for your text can be changed until you want to push the button "OK" after the image has been saved once, the text is part of the picture. it can't be changed anymore.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digiplug; tool stencil apply to create a stencil on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image template in image processing can be used to place templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the stencil, there are no restrictions about the size and orientation. you need to add the PNG file size. if you want to add your stencil template. you simply send an e-mail in English to the & digiplug; mailinglist digiplug-Users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for first time, you have to put your stencil with the button Base folder in the dialog. select the folder where you have to copy the stencil files. these settings will be noticed for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder for templates, a building view appears, which reflects the file structure of the stencil template. the selection of a folder is updated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">You can find three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this knob increases the next image. it is centered around the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrinking: this button resized the picture below. it is centered around the mouse. if you want to use the template on the entire image, you have to shrink the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Postpone: use this button to move the picture below the template. take the picture and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK when you want to use the stencil on your image. the image will then be adapted to automatically.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digiplug; presents three different tool for sharpening. each of you have advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but produces especially in dark areas, grained pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">Sharpness mask works on the contrast of the edges to a picture sharpate. actually, it doesn't work to remove atmospheric Dunst and makes it a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by copyright protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">It is probably the best of the three because he really improved the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its use and has different parameters to adapt.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalised images need a correction of sharpness. this again leads to a common colour. this is that sharp edges are printed. the same phenomenon can usually be printed on paper. SLR cameras do usually need more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for the private user.</seg>
<seg id="484">At JPEG pictures, a camera is often applied to internal sharpening. images in the raw format is always necessary during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanner apply a sharpening filter already during the reading of the image. when you disable this deactivate the control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can obtain usable results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening device. you can correct sharpening the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">However, they should be careful if the results are not very naturally result: the sharpenness increase the edge of the edges, but also amplifies the noise. in general, the usable technique is sharply to correct. in general, you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to correct but sharpen it is much easier than it's sharpening. use the tool for softening with the menu entry to the right side of the dialog box shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp masked is a very good tool to remove the veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original photo and preview can help edit the picture. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values do often generate good results and should try out first. an increase in the radius or amount amplify the effect. if you make the sharpness mask to strong, crayon and the impression of barbecue will produce near sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is how many pixels are affected on each side of an edge through the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. you should therefore sharpen pictures at best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the ignoring picture one of the original is added. this makes the strength of the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling value is a break from the maximum RGB value and the fixing difference. one can thus define a minimum difference to use the filter. this way, areas with a soft change between the potters are exempt from sharpening from sharpening, and therefore beautify errors in mind, heavens and water surface.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of uncoated filter. the original picture is the (1) and the illustrated picture (2). unsharp masked was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swelling value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digiplug; tool refocus is focused on a picture due to improvement of the sharpness. it used to be protected by the protected protected exhaust filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries an image to & quot; reforessive quot; in which it is using a technique called FIR Viennese filtration. this is using a technique called FIR Viennese Filing. it can usually reach better results as unsharp. you can start from the menu by taking colors refocal in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular saw is much better than the Gauss's folding. the Gauß's folding has a very long tail, which is far away from the source pixel, which is far beyond the source pixel size. the FIR Viennese Inverse is affected by most cases even very strongly influenced by the remote pixels. that causes unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for use of this module. for most images, the default value should be 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image should be very unsharp, but then on canyters.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: a correlation of correlation can help reduce artifacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation was reduced the sharpness effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Caterfilter: an increase of the caterate filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values are higher than 0.1 only rarely helpful if the sound quality is too low, and eg; 0 is the image quality very bad. a usable value is 0,03. a high value will continue to prevent the image.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauss's sharpness. do you use this parameter to avoid unsharpening filter. in most cases you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you need a value equal to 0, you may also increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrizensize: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. however, an increase in the mat size can choose good results. however, note that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter. in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any refocus parameter set you set for later and can be loaded afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform any cutting, color and intensity fixes on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before changing the image elsewhere. the reason for this is that many surgeries are not visible yet visible, but later left unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you want to read and compress pictures, and eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masked better results than sharpening. this could cause it to be blurred, use a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically it must always be blurgently to produce artifact. even under optimal conditions it can never show the effect of unsharpic filters. practically, the result of the FIR Viennese Filters is always at least just as good as the infinitely mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better than the machining of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between different filters, on a small unfocused picture, see:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color image has to be corrected. this image has been made with an analogue camera. the unfocused result is due to unsufficient light for the Auto-focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about methods of sharpness structure in digital images, you can consult a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The knob glasses sets the imsharpness of the range which has been dark, to generate a more natural Pupille.</seg>
<seg id="514">The paint tinte allows a adapted color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can set this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool error correction is one of the most developed tool to remove the desired artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The intraocular algorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen, France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains several preferences as Starpoints to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the rider smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Details p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of details. a small value leads to an even smooth curve over the picture. a value of 0.9 should be used for details because no sharpening should be subsequently needed. please note that the details will always be listed below.</seg>
<seg id="520">Angle dependency of alpha [0,100]: a small value is smoother evenly into all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film grain size or CCD noise will produce a high value of similar patterns. JPEG Artefakte will be removed best at a value in the vicinity of 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">[0, 500]: this sets the maximum setup factor above all. p then defines the relative glucose. therefore, use this value matching the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Rule: [0, 100]: this parameter affects greater structures. the higher the value is set, the more will appreciate if it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh's turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: are on how often the algorithm will pass through. normally, 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle focal length da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropy Alpha. if Alpha is selected, you should make sure that small angles can produce a long runtime. so you should choose this value so the greatest possible and unacceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrative step width [0,1, 10]: integrative step width in pixels. you should avoid the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation: the more quality you will get through the choice of this option is low. it doubles but the running time. we recommend it to let him leave.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons Save as and shop do exactly this. each setting of image error correction can be stored in a text file and later reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image error correction is comparatively very fast in work. however, it can still be very long and a high CPU load after moving. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button termination.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how to remove image error with Small Artefakt. this module is used on a picture that was caused by a bad filmmaking during the journey failed. the original picture is under (1) and correct picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digiplug is a very powerful tool to reduce image exchange. it uses a protected algorithm by Peter Heckel.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artifacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove senses from the camera or moireins; remove effects from scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read this tutorial on English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screen photo above shows a typical scene which was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grain noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases you need only the subwindow details and the subwindow advanced settings can remain at the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controlled the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which requires the filters a pixels per pixel and can increase the image. by the radius the area is moving across the picture and the color in it is smoother and thereby smaller errors.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness of the filter. this value sets the pixel pitch after the front, if it is increased. if the value is too high, the adaptive filters can no longer be received and smoked up. if the value is too high, the adaptive filters can no longer receive and smokers down.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. if it is too strong, the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, the entire noise can be removed or noise-tips. put it at a value close to the maximum, if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance of the image. we recommend to change either color or luminance to improve an image. this settings will not affect the smoother process by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerant of the image. we recommend to modify either color or luminance to improve an image. this settings will not affect the smoother process by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the Gammatolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker ranges which typically affects stronger, but also polluted the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the alignment of phasenjitterdamping. this value defined as quickly the adaptive filter radius on variations of the luminance. if it is increased, the edges will appear on the edges. if it's on a minimum, cradle and phasenjitter may occur. it can remove space and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used exactly to use. all parameters for the noise, which you have set, can be saved in the file system and later loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example to change how to change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected parameter was used with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture to crisp for your purpose. the solution, the image is a bit soft to sharpen. use tool for softening with the menu entry to correct and experimenting with the plain. the preview window indicates the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digiplug was; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo albums.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter to restorate you the opportunity to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts about your pictures. it is very good adapted to remove Gauß, original or subsequently digitalised images. the smoothing takes place along the image contours and makes the content as it also makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and text application. the text box is performed using another tool, the error correction, developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannoses and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefakte reduce the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a deserted compression algorithm produces some compression & quot; - small standards can be correct in the uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons Save as and shop do exactly this. each setting of photo restorration can hereby be saved in a text file and later reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restorration is comparatively very fast in the work. however, it can still be very long and a high CPU load after moving. you can therefore start the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below, you can reduce as a photo with Equal space. this module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the infamous film gradation on the vocabulary. the original image is listed below (1) and correct under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example for the photo restoration. this time, textures can be applied to an old colour photo that caused by a scanner. you can see the scan factory which was shown by the Scannerillumination and photo paper. the original image is listed below (1) and the correct picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digiplug; Tool Hotpixels allows you to remove Hotpixels from photos which have been removed with a CCD camera, eight were used to remove algorithms from the JPEGPixi Project that are protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are especially a problem since many cameras with JPEG compression via a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixel quot; and "quot; bright pixel quot; on a photo with a dark-picture subtract method. there are currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file into the assistants with the button dark screen. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixel. these are highlighted in the image review.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important that you can record the dark screen directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the appropriate dark picture to the correct picture. an automatic processing of the dark screen will find the bad pixels. please note that the assistant invites the last dark picture and this automatically gets in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image range and the preview will help you correct the result of the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are highlighted in all areas of view.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to watch the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. choose the best filter method to interpolishing these pixel blocks. these are the available filter available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Thirst: there is an average of neighborhoods. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a gap of 1 pixel pitch will be drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolishing the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel rate are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which then uses to interpolishing the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a gap of 3 or less are drawn to compute a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of Cuban curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolishing the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photograph, made of a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been increased to 300% (1) and the corrected picture is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digiplug; Vignettification correction is a tool to correct the Vignetting, i.e., lower corners, one image to correct.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lens, especially those in the medium and large photo format, often can not even reach the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignetting quot; (shady) it reaches the edges and edges of the picture by reducing the light to the sensor.</seg>
<seg id="568">But he also has disadvantages. many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter, which should be impossible to keep the camera with hand. wide angle lens should also use center filter, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, since otherwise unsharpening effects will arise through movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure areas of today's filming and shades of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter, which is used without this filter. the tool for Vignettification correction is provided with a Centerfilter on a picture. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">Check the Vignettification correction filter with three control units and three more the exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light amplification at the point of the greatest density the filter. the default density is 2.0, or randomly to compensate a luminous intensity of 2, unriverb.narrates to compensate a larger degree of vignetting, reduce it to compensate a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leuchintensity, contrast and gamma settings: the works of a picture with the Vignettification correction is reduced the luminosity of the target image with these options. regulators set only positive values as you have to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want to adjust the imaging of the exposure of the target image, so let the values for luminosity / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digiplug; picture production from the menu color Gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignettification correction to a picture. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the correct picture and counterfcorrection is also performed in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digiplug; Linsendistortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometrical distortion. colorless distortions can not be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree deals with the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar effect, but flashing the edges. this correction is not used in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of fourth grain is corrected the remote corners opposite to the second degree. if you can combine these two, each geometrical distortion is almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of the distortion second degree. with negative values can be corrected and positive values kissenic distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion part of the distortion. this value is stronger than changing the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'corners of the parameter set the parameter of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size and causes a correction of first gradient by. negative values improve during positive the picture.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brighter: this value adjusted the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase.</seg>
<seg id="584">To find you the best filter settings, illustrating the dialog with a preview of the distortions. the values for your image are stored and used as default values for your image.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonnage or kissenic correction should be carried out in front of all concision or size changes. best result you perform this correction as all the first. if you have a painting and then perform an asymmetrical correction would be the effect of wrong the wrong.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you can find the best correction to show you this tool a vertical and horizontal relief line. move it into an important place, such as the sea level or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines on this place. in connection, you can correct the tonnage / kissenic distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a crust-shaped distortion is the resulting image of black corners. you can remove these with the cutting tool in the menu transformersing from the image processing or via the zoom knob of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures the tonnage correction is enough. the next logical step for some motifs like pictures from the front, frame and paintings are the perspective so correct to correct the angle in the picture 90 degrees. note that if you keep the camera with hand, you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example for the tonnage correction to a church in Norway. the original image is under (1) and the corrected picture (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film of GvaccGuru.org website, which is available under this URL. filter reproduces the known Ilford (TM) SFX200 Iinfrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left-hand side of the window you can select the area for the preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can adjust two parameters of film grazing and film sensitivity (ISO). enable the ISO regulator the amount of film grains and the dominance of the color Green (chlorophyll in nature) in the conversion. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter color channels are misused by infra-red film, especially the green channel does not turn the effect on black / white photos as the color information are missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of Infrared cinemas used on a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is listed below (1) and the image of the film has been set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a type Aura in the peak lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digiplug; filter filmmaker is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film grazing on your images. this is known from classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X, known to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturer of great silver grain of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film effect effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. if you want to use this special, gallery-like, road photo, graceful view, especially in your monochromen photos, you need to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is even though higher values are needed, to ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can use the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of film strip effect on a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked (2). the used film sensitivity correspond to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digiplug; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digiplug; Filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting. natural pictures and styles are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controllers to influence this effect. the upper selects the pin size between one and five. thicker brush are better suited for large pictures. smoother controls the plain or from the other side, the hinge.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with (1) and the picture is marked with (2). pinching size for this 640 pixels wide image is 1 and Smooth 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digiplug; Filter coal drawing used color and intensity gradients to create a cabbage in drawing, are therefore emphasized for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene would have chosen to skate you. this would be good pictures to start making it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pin size and the lower adjust the contrast.</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon-recording filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2) and the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digiplug; filter engraving contains your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digiplug; Filter engraving is a fast tool to return your images with a 3-D effect. it works especially well with a simple structure, in which colour is not the most important at the content. filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey, monarch landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, is equal to 10%, the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engravant filter. the original (1) and the illustrated picture (2). the depth used is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">This filter group allows you to transform a normal photo in an artwork with distortion effects. it uses a copyright protected algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divide the image in cells and makes it look like if it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analog to the wave blocks 1 the image here is distorted with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can terminate this effects at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">This filter group allows you to transform a normal photo in an artwork with visual acuity. it uses a copyright protected algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharpic: wipe the image along steep lines coming out from a center. this simulates the unsharpness of a zoomed camera and thereby creating a dynamic expression of often in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radiale Unsharpic: wipe the picture by rotation of the pixels around a center. this simulates the unsharpness of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distances: wipe the picture to create the effect of a non-focused camera se. the object seems back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion sharsharpness: wipe the picture through horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the imsharpness of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photographing, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softening impulses: wipe the picture soft in the dark and strongly in the bright tones. this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or add a warm and subtiled light.</seg>
<seg id="620">Push-sharshark: wipe the image through accidental shift of pixels and simulates the imsharpness of a arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent unsharpness: finds the paddling in the picture and wiped them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divide the photo in rectangular cells and then created it by filling with an average pixel rate.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The rainy drops are a nice little tool to make rainy drops onto your image. this gives a natural look for natural look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Drip size allows you to change the size of the drips. because the drip size is not possible automatically with the size of the image, it is often necessary to reduce the size for small pictures. number of drops change to the optical effect of drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the & digiplug; image processing is free of regression. use the range of tools to choose the area, e.g. a vision that should stay free. if you then start the filter trays, the area will remain free of regression.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrops Filters. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the illustrated picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the picture has the wrong orientation, you can bring it by mirrors or turning into the right orientation. you will find the tools in the menu transformations and transformating mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflated is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">An image to shrinkage is simple. the big question is how you can find a picture when you reach the resolution? how can you find the missing information? how can you see the missing information? how can you see the missing information? how can you see the missing information? how can you see the missing information here. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo is the wrong size you can change it to the desired size with the size of size. select the size change in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog box is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool used to change the size of a linear interpolation method to enlarge the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality then try the tool to blown off.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use a type of interpolation, e.g. split interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digiplug; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You must tell the tool as you want to change the size. these settings are available in the rider Neue Size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Keeping aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, when entering the new size, the aspect ratio will preserve the aspect ratio of the original image.</seg>
<seg id="636">Rule: [0, 100]: this parameter affects greater structures. the higher the value is set, the more will appreciate if it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh's turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons Save as and store are used exactly. each insert for photo can be saved as text file and later reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflated is very fast with what it makes, but it can still be very long and a high CPU load after moving. you can break the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo shooting, enlarged by a small color image to the double size. the original (1) and the enlarged picture (2) is the result of the linear standard enlargement to comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photos is not just a frequently performed surgery, but also a often underestimated tool to create a picture with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and pull out the rectangle, then you will see this rectangle that move your mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you start the mouse button, you will be cut off the area of the photos. therefore, you can change a good overview how your photo would look after cutting, by clicking on the corners of the rectangle, creating a new rectangle that simply drag along with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting button, use the button Concutting button in the toolbar and the photo is tailored (Ctrl; + X). use the entries to Save or file Save as in the menu file to save the newly designed photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the courts, you can change the size of the rectangle by postpone the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool for aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high-format or cross-format. in high-format, the larger value of the height and in the width of the width is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool According to page ratio uses an important aspect ratio. this means that it is always equal, regardless of whether you use centimeters, Inch or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of dialogue there are two buttons to adjust the selection automatically horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below the dialog you can use the Max. relationship button to cut the maximum possible, depending on the selected relationship and orientation, set.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool According to page aspect saves the settings depending on image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you are stored the access tool to the next time, this settings are displayed in the EXIF tables so that the EXIF data is reflected and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The compositions of the compositions enable help to create and put your pictures better. these are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic submissions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third party, harmonic triangles have an opportunity to have a rectangle in similar harmonic triangles to the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden middle is a split which is in different natural growth pattern, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the blossom leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all possible things that we find as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden pitch is the error number 1,618033988... and it was used to build your temple and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you have your images, buildings and even photos, to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc., where each number is equal to 1 equals 1: 1.618 the golden middle. a composition of this rule is considered visual harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden middle represents more liqueer supplies available if you have an image. these are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will bring you good results for your photos. compared to third party cones, the golden spiral is a liquid line that can follow the eye through the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">A further rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called the golden spiral. it should be something that the eye can turn in the center of the composition. that can be a line with or different objects. this thing can be just there without the eye, it will carry out its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles is also separated from the above-discussed golden spiral. please note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles are no equalled triangles. diagonal to plazing these lines can be viewed as a static object.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you are using golden triangles around your frame, you will create a effect of professional photograph dynamic Symmetry. try your image focus on one of the intersections and other visual information in triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can't reach anywhere else.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options horizontally mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic submissions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button Color, you can set the colour of the auxiliary lines. if you have a painting with many colors and a high contrast, the help lines can be invisible. on this type you can adjust the colour of the lines your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, then it happens to fix the camera. this creates a picture where the things turned around an angle. you can manually repair this with the & digiplug; image processing and the tool free rotation. choose this transformating free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your image with the slider angle. the values on this slider are given in degrees. with the button presets you can reset the slider again to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture will be shown above.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the module includes a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse pointer to the two lines. after you move it over an important point of the picture, you can affix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have shot a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a possibility to repair this is the function transformersing from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the picture is easy to cut the function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The option of anti-aliasing glutteth the picture a bit after the rotation. however, please note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectral transformations are performed to a fixation of the so-called reference point. this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to view the red squares in the corners of your image. the preview will then automatically be calculated automatically. on the right side of the dialog box you will find some information which will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas which are created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas which are created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left above: shows the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed zone.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees on the upper right corner of the transformed zone.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left: shows the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed zone.</seg>
<seg id="675">Right bottom: shows the current angle in degrees on the lower right corner of the transformed zone.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image is somewhat polluted. for individual adjustment, this effect is small, but two adjustments generate twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After completing the perspective, you get unpleasant triangular holes in the corners. an option to refer to this is the picture with transformersing cut out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool used is used to move a part of the image to the right and move the other part in the opposite direction. this is no rotation, the picture is distorted. with other words, a rectangle is transformed into a parallelogram. you can start this module via transformers.</seg>
<seg id="679">Check your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical corners. you can press horizontally and vertically at the same time. if you want to push the angle, the angle will be displayed on zero. a preview of the effectiveness will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="680">At your help, a vertical and horizontal line are integrated. move your mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have carried out the signature, the image will usually be wiped. for a single level, this effect is usually neglegible, but two casings generate twice as much as wiping and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After crossing the image has unbeautiful triangular holes in the corners. a possibility to remove this is the image with transformersing cut out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digiplug; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write files from your system and, in some cases, from the type such as these libraries are compilated. in most distributions you will process a large number of image formats with & digious cases.</seg>

<seg id="843">The MPEG Kodierer module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length, add the packages of MjpegTools and ImageMagick. you can also add a basic image file between the individual images. you can also add a audio file in MP2 or WAV of the Diashau.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images will be scaled automatically to the correct size for the selected video format. in addition, you can create a background color for the selected video format. with this module, it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first select the images to be packed into MPEG Diashau. then you can start the module via extras MPEG Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected by you are under image files in the portfolio. you can also change the images or the content of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should customize the other settings. the video format can be selected from different formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. PAL is pre-set and most probably the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should specify the time in seconds. the speed of image transition will be specified among them. a low value creates very sudden, a high level of smooth image changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set as the next one. in doubt you should set it black. the name and the path of the generated file you can define it under the name of the MPEG output file. keep them as if possible the Enummpg.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify a audio file under the name of the audio source file, you can start with the button. after you can start your computer with the button. depending on the speed of your computer you can now drink a coffee or drink in all tranquility if you are back again.</seg>

<seg id="852">The print assistant allows several pictures on one sheet paper to print together in standard Photosizes. the combined pictures can also be opened automatically with the image processing gimp. this is a sense to improve it or print with Gimp module to direct expression.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can convert your RAW format saved in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM respectively.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw from Dave Coffin. a original version of Him is: expect from dcw not that there are the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with dcw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, select the RAW file to be converted and start the module. the Raw image converter window appears in mode for a single image. with the button you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides whether the camera settings are to be used to the white. the key parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can further edit the picture later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected to use the contrast information. if your camera has been working in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview you can choose one of the three output formats and converting the conversion result. JPEG uses a loss algorithm. JPEG uses a loss algorithm and produces the smallest file size.</seg>
<seg id="859">Tagged image format, TIFF, keeps all information of your image and uses the lossfree LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you're using your images frequently or later you should not continue to use JPEG format, since there is only a limited number of operations before the image quality is deteriorated. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose to JPEG as a memory format, the metadata will be stored in the RAW file in the EXIF information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start the conversion button. if you want to break this process, you can abusing this process.</seg>
<seg id="863">The pile-processing mode allows you to convert various images to one time. do not use this mode if you are sure, for example, by testing in a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for individual pictures. however, this is helpful if these were created in an earlier attempt. however, this is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to recompress all images in a album. it uses the program to convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>

<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection. it is used to reduce the image from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce the image or enlarge it:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is automatically selected, in dependence of the image orientation, selected. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to match your image format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Non proportional: nonproportionate size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed for this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pressure preparation: prepares the image for the photo-pressure. the user can adjust the pressure resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, boundary size and background color is adapted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module, you can send selected pictures with your favorite e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the connected pictures in advance. more images can go to the list of the connected pictures and place there.</seg>

<seg id="877">Do not pay attention to many pictures at once. most e-mail accounts have restrictions on the size of the e-mails. it may be a good idea to send several mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The E-Mail Window is used to change the settings for the sending of the images. your configuration is stored and changed once again until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail clients from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you need to specify the right path for your installation.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail Service, you need to install the GMailAgent on your computer. you can download this here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After the selection of comments in a fixed file, comments on the pictures are put together into a text file and email.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format below the menu file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted under the lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you want to have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise, we recommend to JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG under Pictures file format and select the original files in JPEG format, then the original Exifdata will be added to the senseless pictures.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not be closed automatically, so you can watch the status messages, on the search for errors. your e-mail program will automatically start at the end. with the button closure, you can get this window schlie? EN.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the Moduls Advanced Diaschal, a window will be presented with questions like you want to show your Diaschau. you can choose between the selected and all images of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL transitions option in the presentation allows very elegant image outputs using OpenGL. however, you have to own a corresponding graph card, otherwise the Diaschal will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The filename option ensures that the filename of the pictures will be displayed in the left corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an end loop. you can then remove manually using Esc;</seg>
<seg id="889">The option is randomly chosen that the images will be displayed in a random order. it is not used in the order of the images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Among delay between the images may be set between different pictures. 1500 milliseconds are set to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect. you should test this way before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can choose. randomly selects each transition between the pictures a different effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the Diaschau, you can access to a toolbar at the top left screen. move the mouse into this corner to switch you.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this tool bar you can hold the presentation and start back to the previous and next picture and stop the Diashau.</seg>
<seg id="894">On the left side of the screen, you can see the current file names, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing, please contact the mailing list of KIPI teams under kde-imaging @ kde.org. attention: participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background picture is a tool to set a picture as background picture for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the lower part, as a background for your KDE worksurface.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes, you can see with & kout album; by these browsers, see picture. as you can see by a comparison with the picture, so in any group, so in people, places and in group words.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you can see the categories as you have entered information and videos with notes. in addition, there are entries to view the file structure on your hard disk, and of course the current look at. in the following is described for itself.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you press with the mouse on the entry, the view of the browser window is changing. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select one more person, only the pictures are displayed on which both individuals can be seen. by this selection method, you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images on a few single pictures.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all people, places and other settings, you can view with preview images to view the pictures of your active area.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture, each person has the same symbol in front of their names. you can store with & kite album; however, for every person an own eyes, this is also true for locations, passwords and other categories that you own themselves. see also the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">In order to view images next to the name, select the button where you want to use the right outside on the toolbar. please note that you can view the view for each category. this has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of persons and simultaneously a list of sample files (if you have no suitable pictures for your words).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must also specify the image for each individual person. in order to see this, you'll need to customize the image editor, as shown in the picture window, you can customize the magnification factor according to your requirements and thus select which part of the image will be rendered or cut.</seg>
<seg id="906">If you are looking for searching in the main window, you will see a dialog box which is very similar to the illustration of the image properties. this dialog can look at the picture once again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you want to enter a character sequence or descriptions of the pictures to this text, if you want, you can also enter a date, so for example 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all images after certain names, as you can see in the picture. here, on images, on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kite album; if you don't like to read manuals, but rather to test functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kite album; and check out the fast entry, screen photos and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & check out Album; and select in the first dialog for the demo if you start & check out Album; for the first time, or select the menu entry to the menu entry into the menu. as a result, some example images are loaded and you can try the functions of & kite album; try out.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual you will find it on the homepage of & kite album; as a program HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom edge of the main window of & kite album; see the time bar here. a picture of this laviest see here:. as the name already says, these will show you data statistics about the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The time bar can display several different time units. each strip indicates a different unit. you can switch between the units, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying the strip only 10 minutes sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The time bar can be used on the following ways: you can change the displayed preview view from the database (if you select a date, you will always look the first picture of this date in preview window) and also shows the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in preview View.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a range of time bar by pressing the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the time bar, so the time values are displayed. you can select the selection only pictures of this period. you can select the selection by clicking on a bar of the time bar.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kite album; presented to you two options available to create HTML websites with your images. the one is available in & kite album; integrated and the other than module available (see). in the following part of the user book, the text is described in & kout album; integrated version you can create about the menu file HTML... call.</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages you need to make some settings. these are described in the three areas of content, layout and finish. the following is described in the following areas.</seg>
<seg id="919">First enter the title of the review and a description which should contain the HTML file later. on the list box; HTML example pages you can see an example of this settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, you choose whether a & kite album; export file is to be created on the review page. do more information about export files you will find in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Last, you can select which information can be displayed on the HTML pages. so, for example, all pictures are displayed by a party. please note that all pictures are exported. currently you can't use this setting to hide certain pictures from certain viewing lights.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this range you can define how the HTML pages should look like. most of the installation options are clearly, why not for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="923">Below the page you can adjust different resolutions for the pictures. as you have to view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no images can be downloaded, for example a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer's viewer can change the dissolution at any time. it can thus change your images with low resolution, which means to a lower transfer time, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting area, select the various folders and the URL to where your site is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">At best, choose a base folder for all your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent sentence.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you need to select the main folder where all your pictures are stored. this folder will be stored and automatically supplemented by the next time. this folder you can select either a folder or by KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your pictures, you may check if this really is visible for the base folder, a web browser after the pages have been created, the URL should be specified here. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created in the final target folders you need to copy them manually. thus, the import function, see, correctly, you will need to specify the final goal of files. this is not the folder of the current files but the base folder where all sub-folders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The just described positions have all three basic folders or URLs. in these, a subfolder is created, whose name can be fixed in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are looking forward to a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or anywhere else, you would like to create a HTML page for viewing the images. if you already have a lot of time to view the images. if you already have a lot of time to consider the pictures, recording location, etc., this work must not be done once again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kite album; you can import a copy of your images into a .kim file. you can import other into your database. they are imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim -files, internal and external. they distinguish themselves whether the images can be stored inside the file, or if the images can be stored in the file, you can put all the pictures into the file, and this file is so independent. the obvious downside is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can convert a .kim file either directly from the menu file exporting... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with a HTML file, this will create an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file search the pictures at two times. first, the pictures will not be found in the folder of the .kim file. these images will not be found when creating the HTML files, this is only possible if you have created your .kim file using HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting pictures will be described above the menu file exporting up menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is to do if it is an internal or external .kim -files. there are the following three selection options available:</seg>
<seg id="938">With the option Manual close to .kim-file you need to copy the pictures into the same folder as the .kim-file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option Automatically copy the .kim-file to copy and copy the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim -files are normal Zip files. as most pictures have been compressed using JPEG. if you want to compress the files even very small, if you want to compress this, simply select the export file option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is maximum picture size. if you would like to send your friends pictures if the .kim file would be very big. here you can limit the size by example, by example, that each picture should be at maximum 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you want to import a file using the folder .kim from the web browser or from the menu file importing... select & kite album; the exporting database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to importing consists of four steps. first you need to select which pictures you want to import, in which folders should be copied to import pictures.</seg>
<seg id="944">It can be that you are called the category of people to imported file the category (if you are a Dans), while this category is required for your database. therefore, you will be imported in the third dialogue window, which are to be imported in categories as well as these categories in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can read the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database. one example you can see on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse pictures to browse and see: if one sees pictures, you'd like to watch pictures of your Italy vacation and see a picture with your friend you would like to see all the pictures on which this friend can be seen.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will find the different steps from (1) fixed the information about your pictures, about (2) to search and see up to (3) advanced themes and adapting possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoalbum was started as a program for managing your pictures. however, it was expanded and today's your videos. in many places in this manual you have talked about pictures but often simply closes these videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kite album; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the top folder of their images. this is a simple XML file which you can use with a program of your choice, e.g. Normale backup tools, copy to a disk or revisions in CVS, where you want to.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kite album; remembers the folder where your pictures are stored and uses this with future start again. if you want to start another folder in & kite album. if you want to start another folder with pictures, you can start & kout Album; with the -c option -c ~ / company / images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu entry Settings menu; configure... get to a window with which you can change the settings of & kite album; in the following section of the user book you will be explained.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols, with which you can call the possibilities of preview and options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which allows you to retrieve your F1 key and click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">In fact, as you can create different features such as objects, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">You can see the dialogue that is used to process already existing groups. for each existing group you can choose a labelling and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories were already mentioned. in the dialog box options, you can teach complete membership groups, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a mediator as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">You can see the setup possibilities which are available to you to configure membership groups. in the top window you can select the category you want to configure. in the left window, you can select a list of the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kite album; divides its modular system with other graphic applications such as digiKam and Gwenview. this modular system is called KIPI and means & kde; image plugin interface. you can find on the homepage from Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called via the menu modules. the modules can be viewed and are not described in this manual, since they are not part of & kite album; however, most modules have a help page which can call for the modules itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules of several applications are common to each other, it can always be tested with the demo database before you want to retrieve it on your own pictures; demo database can be found either via the command line with the command &gt; kumerinput\ &gt; or via the menu help. do not say, I would not have warned!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use modules above KIPI have been common, are very different, making it possible that some modules with & kout Album; do not work. this is the downside when you share functions with various applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kite album; and other applications that also use KIPI, is that the other applications have not supported their images in albums, this type of order is not supported, simulate it for some modules the order to albums, so you can use the functions with & kite album.</seg>
<seg id="962">It simulates & kite album; the current album that simply corresponds to the current view, so all the images that show you the picture preview now.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, & kite album has to pass the modules, even a list of albums. here goes & kout Album; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">When & kite album; s browser shows the contents of a category, for example, all persons, then each entry represents a record for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it is the category that you have specified in the dialog for virtual albums as a category for virtual albums. if you can use the category for example, if you have selected the category for example, so if you have selected persons to view and add this module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kite album are not compatible, you can remove this from the list of modules. start the installation dialog and select the modules installed which modules are to be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example for a start screen once you start & kout Album; start your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you have been used by any other KDE application, you can see the window with which you have entered your image database. currently, we don't have any more information about your pictures. in the section we will see on this window, then click on the picture to show you an overview with all existing images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kite album; is the opportunity to see each picture with notes, where the image has been taken on the picture where the image has been recorded separately or for a larger number of images assigned simultaneously. if for example, on all images of Jesper, and all pictures were taken up in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All of these notes can be used for searching and browser, as you can read in the section. if you want to see this notes when you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In case you can see three lists with a text field by taking people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kite album; if you're still using information on your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is to move the pictures within the list: if you are looking for example a family party and on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 people can be viewed, so that the names are moved to the above, can be found faster and easily.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to see an alphabetical list of alphabetical list, click on the icon to list under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected comments for each image, you wish to edit any selected images and add these pictures with notes. just click on the buttons and back buttons, which are located under the preview of the picture to the top.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have several images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to select all these pictures and add the menu item multiple entries at one time with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all in the USA. there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you can see a Browserwindow of the US as an overgroup. in order to show you, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the attenualogs is it possible to add an entry to a subcategory or subcategory. in addition, you can also add an entry to a subcategory of this entry. attention, this assumes that you are involved in alphabetical order alphabetically. see here.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the concern dialogs by clicking on the edges of the frame, click and postpone. you can also make your own window by drag him outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs, you are satisfied with the settings, click on the button options..., which offers you the possibility to save the current structure and the appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also view a frame completely. if you want to recover this window later, use the button options... and here then window will see a / off. this procedure can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry images in your browser, you will get an overview of the current selected images, or all the pictures if you don't have a filter. for example, you can see the size of the keys, by simply follow the mouse button with the middle mouse button. try it just once.</seg>
<seg id="983">When you cover a picture on the background of your desktop, this picture is set up as background images for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">When you click on an image, this picture is displayed in the image. if you have no window with a picture viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the picture presentation. simply select the corresponding images from which you want to delete or choose either the removing button or select the menu click here. now you will see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kite album; you can also use a solution for this problem. you can also use the pictures without you saved on the hard drive. in the picture you can see the pictures anywhere, so you can see the pictures from the hard disk image. in the picture you can see the view from & kittens; if not all required images from hard disk can be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images, where the right corner is cut off, are not stored on the hard disk. for images 5-9, however, these pictures are present, so that your images can show you the preview of this pictures. however, you can also view this pictures with the image.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see this function you need to copy files from the folders and copy it again. if you want to avoid any longer a CD, if you want to avoid any other hard drive, please purchase a larger hard drive to save all the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu pictures you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to make a little more privacy, see the pictures so that you may see for others inaccessible in the menu privacy. alternatively, you can also see all the images that may see your little sister, you will see and select the menu item anything out of current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">In order to set the images in the case of the thread, you will simply lock the menu entry to your little sister, so that all the pictures you want to be blocked off. if you want to recover the pictures again, click to Sperre.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to set a password which must be entered for unlock the pictures. in order to set up this password, you will simply change password in the menu privacy.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please remember that this picture protection must not be very safe. for example, all images on the hard drive and others can only read or delete this type of password protection. this type of password protection is only for those who are familiar with & kout album; not very familiar, looking at private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you can manage all your images with & kout album; manage and hours over hours therefore, of course you want to view it sometime. from this reason & kite album. this is what you can see from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see the viewer. it shows the picture, but additional all the information you have shown on the picture, such as anyone is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the Infobox on the upper part of the picture you want to see, so you can configure this simply using the mouse, and what information can be displayed. all these options are available after a right click on the viewer. all of these options are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the Infobox are underlined. if you click here to see your browser on Anne Helene, the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Helene. as if you have been selected from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have multiple pictures in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back, by using the buttons picture high and picture. you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos1 and end. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple pictures are uploaded in the viewer, you can then press this as Diaschau. & kite album; invites you to press a new picture after a few seconds. as often a new picture can be checked by pressing the Ctrl button and plus Minus by buttons Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability of the viewer's viewer is to be able to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete space on the screen. simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">If you are using the viewer, you can easily go into the picture and get out with the mouse. using the Minus button, you can zoom out again to the middle of the picture. shows how a Zoom-rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point-button you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not drawn with the zooms, so that each pixels is equivalent to a pixels of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoomoperations work with videos that come in and out with the Plus- and Minus.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the script functions from the context menu you can turn the image. this does not work with videos. you can note annotations on the actual picture with the menu item notes from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you have a look at the picture you can see a picture of a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture. at the moment you can open the image and configuration dialog of the picture to select this name. however, you will have to mark the picture to mark and look more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the pictures on paper. to see what photos you want to start the viewer with the pictures and try them as good or bad, while you can see one after the others.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the opportunity to view images with features while you watch them. characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature so that you can press the corresponding letters. in the case you can see a picture where the A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your pictures, you can view it in your browser. if you are reading all the pictures you can edit, print or whatever you have selected, so you can use one module to copy the selected images on a CD or what you want to do.</seg>

<seg id="1024">When a transformation is elected, marks disappear the control points and it is displayed a small cross in the wire-section view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift through pulling out with the mouse within the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a visual inspection level. you can specify this value relative to the visible object of the superior object or as an absolute value. objects are displayed only if they are selected or their visual levels of small or equal to the visual stage of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& Kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as a default. the object-tree and view of the object characteristics are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you do not like the standard shutters, or if you need a different arrangement, you can store them as desired. you can also save multiple shields and easily between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To ensure a window over or under a view over view, drag the folds to the upper or lower edge of a view. a rectangle below shows the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, please take a look at the right or left side of a view. the new view will be anchored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the overall height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views over each other, take the list on another view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card reader reamer above in the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window frames are floating views: views that are not enshrined in the main window. to solve a view from the anchor, drag the counter top to the top left or click the little arrow on the left corner.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To complete a view, click on the small cross in the Anfasserbar. to prevent the closing, click the small square between arrow and cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can add additional views to the main window. in the menu, you will find entries for any type of views. new views are floating, you can combine it in any position.</seg>

<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can renders them. & Povray; 3.1g for Renders, this program has to be installed properly. as this manual is written, it was not supported by Povray; 3.5. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on the icon Renders "icon in the toolbar or select the menu entry view scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode meets the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of the rendering. if you want to add a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can add any number of Render modes, from a quick preview up to full images in highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the icon of the Render settings in the toolbar or in the menu pane Render modes..., the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it is a name that can recognize the features of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size, you can renounce the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to renders a small area of the image, select the box section and enter the image section to the rendering in the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination with quality, you can select the properties that uses & Povray; used by a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuser reflex lighting. a detailed description of the Render properties are found in the usandbuch / Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If an image is rendered with only one beam per pixel, there are often different errors. these pictures have often appear a moirè pattern or stud effects in curves and lines, sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel. this effect is aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; used a technique called anti-aliasing, to reduce the influence of these errors. in general, pictures will look better with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn off anti-aliasing, and connects & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technology means great sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. the second method is adaptive and non-recursive; recursively, because each pixels is split again and adaptive to the calculated values of the calculated colour values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray persecuted a ray per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold. if you calculate the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be charged, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) extra rays each pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays each. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, then the pixels will be divided into 4 sub-pixel, which can be controlled individually and to further subdivision. maximum depth of recursion can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another possibility to reduce aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process called Jittering. if you switch Jittering, changing & Povray; radiates a tiny amount to avoid regular samples.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; the diffuse light reflection is calculated. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this card card you can set whether the alpha channels are calculated by POV-Ray. one pixel is transparent if the associated rays have no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying & Povray; -console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly, you can find the reason for this.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; -scene to import, select the menu entry file importing... and select a file in dialogue window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently & kpovmodeler is currently not supported by the full command line of & Povray; when importing error messages or warnings, a dialog window shows a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; import the source between the two special comments / / * PMRawning and / / * PMRawend.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can draw objects from the object tree into the editor to import the source file for & Povray; this add the source file in the editor. to import objects in the scene, select the source text in the editor and drag him to the Object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copying and insert in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor, you can also insert source code for & Povray; also included.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler is a scene. it usually is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on the help of your own view, opens & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation to the quoted object. set here the path to your document and the version. supported versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example alp data) into the path to the povray; libraries. if you enter files that are not in the folder of the scene, you will also need to get the path to these files here. if a file is used in different paths of the library, the first folded file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for wire models. the second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type characters.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can adjust the object-catcher of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire-screen views. you can adjust the grid separately for shifts, scaling and turning.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values indicate an accurate wire model and therefore a better sewing unit for the displayed objects, but require more time to rendering. for some objects, such as the ball you can set the detail level for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross the highly detailed projections for extended projections, all the camera are using a extended projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions to the perspective and vertical projections. this feature gives a better approach for the projections, but requires more time to renders.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross a wall, there is a wall behind the objects. the wall is displayed in a chess boards from two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the bottom, there is a floor below the objects. the ground is displayed in a chess boards from two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you need to disconnect the non-recursive antialiasing method for the renders of scenes. the values for depth and swelling value can be set. more details on the parameters can be found in section Render modes.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders. in the section window orders will explain how to create windows and save.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The standard version of standard shutdowns: displays all existing window orders. & Kpovmodeler is used for the selected window of shutters at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list box arrangements shows all existing window orders. a new arrangement allows you to create and delete a selected arrangement with the button removing the button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window order is identified by the name. the name must be clear and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name displays all the views of the selected window of window. new views can be created with the button to add and delete selected views with the button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with new column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with unequips the window under the existing window, with card card you will receive a card box view together with the previous view and webmaster the view is not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just returned & Povray; and & kpovmodeler is installed and now you would like to follow no more accurate knowledge of the two programs. if you are able to build all the steps in this tutorial, you should have the ultimate scene with very popular: a ball on a plain.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should keep following warning warning, before you complain about it, that you can use a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program to first time, you should note these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't set off any camera, no rules for the renders can be applied, as a result you will get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you add no light sources, your entire scene is in the dark and you get only a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have any error free installed, see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following preset shutters are installed:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to meet the menus and using existing symbols of the toolbar. read the documentation that you can get an appropriate idea what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will now have to use these menus and symbols now, therefore you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& Kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you must first remove all objects from the object tree. mark the scene and then select the menu entry. so you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire-model view shows how the camera is considered to create the whole scene. in particular, note that in the fourth wire-model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the viewpoint of the camera. this shows you the outcome of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The Object tree now contains a new record with the designation camera. if you click on view, see the content of view object properties, where the different parameters of the camera will find. in user documentation to & Povray; find additional details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Change anything to the basic settings of the camera, this is later subject to the basic settings of the camera, which you can change the camera in view of the camera, with which you can change the target point of the camera. simply click on the left mouse button on a control point and drag him to the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you push the button users or input buttons, the wire-model views and the object is immediately change according to these settings. as a result they see the scene from the viewpoint of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. you could adjust for example a Quader (insertion body Quader) and the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is an enormous approach to solve these task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& Kpovmodeler is actually a simple way. you can use an infinite layer as ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and press the button user or input buttons. the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire-model view now shows the level as well as in the moment only as a limited level. if you renders the scene, extends the plain to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you can view the object tree, you'll notice that you can see the entry for the bottom. in this case you can see the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. choose one of these options, also change the possible settings in view of the object characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should postpone the floor to exercise a unit below the horizontal line, only in order to get some of these parameters. select shifting and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">Select the ground only to hire its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose a bit Easy in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog box opens in which you can select how the object is inserted. please choose the object. the pigment is displayed in the object tree (name = bottom-pigment), with one click on the button preview you can see how the pigment now looks.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigments is just a matte black material because you can still need to check the appearance of materials at any time with one click on preview. specify the colors for the pigment. also, there are many possibilities now, but you can now take the easiest ways now.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see in the preview of no color on Quader and ball, click on the button and call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now correct. if you renders your image now with one click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, you are not able to enter the color. here are further settings required. in the color version you need two new attributes. then edit this entry twice (you can also edit this entry twice, but the chess boards-color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Choose the object tree jedesmal once and change the colours in the view of the object characteristics:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should you already be able to run as you have the basic work of & kpovmodeler you should have. the ball is just as easy as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In view of the object properties you can change the settings. use the value for the radius: to 1 (don't forget to push the input or push the button), so that the ball has a ball over the ground, as you have shifted the floor to a unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the renders makes now a simple result: as already in advance, the ball surface appears like a matte black material. put the following step into a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball you can now show a material now. as already in the bottom, enter the ball a pigment as colour:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select the first object and change the name for example in sphere pigment. click on ball pigment, select one color and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve an interesting effects if you take the time, some finish features:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values like in the following screen photos and click on user or pressing the input.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The brightness effect and reflection result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metal: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression what you have to offer you & kpovmodeler. hopefully, you have already learned as much as you can create nice scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracycing is a render method to create a double-dimensional picture of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you racking a scene raytracing from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that reflects the scenes) through each pixel in the scene. the Render calculated as this beam is reflected in the scene and how atmospheric effects will work like the fog. so the scene pixels is processed for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see without a camera, the camera is your eye, with which you see the scene. without a light source you can see nothing but the image is simple black. obviously, any scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the standard file dialog you can select a file that you have created before using & kpovmodeler</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open a new model or create a new model, the file is inserted into this submenu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">Have you saved the model already, it is stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you need to enter a name and disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">The scene is recovered in the last stored version. all changes since the last storage are rejected.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you don't have any stored changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last back on the command. this menu entry can only be selected if you want to work properly.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Stores the current window arrangement and opens up a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or an existing order.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for the setting of & kpovmodeler; here you can change the appearance, the key root and the standard behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog for changing the button shortcut. you can change using this option prefix for & kpovmodeler; commands to change or add new commands.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens up a dialog for establishing the toolbar. you can add this option tool symbols for & kpovmodeler; add commands and remove.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump-map is an option to feed rough surfaces without changing the surface, without changing the geometric form of the object itself without changing to the geometric form of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file both for a Bump-Map and also for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic body are simple geometrical forms which you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic body. these models will continue to give them a more realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is an option to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis, by application of an image file as a color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuk show; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser. the application features a file browser where you can select images on the ad.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Pictures can either be displayed in either own window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuk show; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can display with clicking on & LMBn or button Return.</seg>

<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can be exchanged with Amarok and Amarok. the easiest way is the use of command dcop; that everyone should defeat each KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most script languages allow executing external programs and commands. in this way, dcop &gt; is usually used. this way can be called dcop &gt; relatively easy. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& amarok; sends alerts to all current scripts. to this reason, scripts are going to monitor their standard entry and react accordingly to events. of course, a script will ignore the events even if there is no use.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure the script to display the setup dialog. to save the saving and charging data, each script will take care of each script. if a script is started, Amarok sets the work folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signalized that a new piece is played. the script could now query & zb; with DCOP features further information on the new piece (for example, the metadata or the unit length).</seg>

<seg id="1195">Before & when the user will stop a script, or if the user sends a script, sends & amarok; the signal SIGTERM is to be ready to do. this signal should be processed to do so for example, e.g. storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amarah script executable can also install script packages that can be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2), which can also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2), so that users can clearly recognize the archive as a Amarok script package.</seg>

<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & K3b features functions like copyCD, format DVD and other functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createMovix.Project () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovix.Project () DCOPRef createMovix.Project () DCOPRef createMovix.Project () DCOPRef createMovix.Project () DCOPRef createMovix.Project () DCOPRef createMovix.Project () DCOPRef createMovix.Project () DCOPRef createMovix.Project () DCOPRef createMovix.Project () DCOPRef createMovix.Project () DCOPRef createMovix.Project () DCOPRef createMovix.Project () DCOPref createMovix.Project () DCOPref createMovix.Project () PCOPref createMovix.Project () PCOPref createMovix.Project ()</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result such an createXXXProject method you can create a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (K3b, K3bProject-0) alternative, you get a reference to the project via # dcop K3b K3bInterface currentProject By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the top of the K3bProjectinterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectinterface, which can only be applicable to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">The createFolder (Qstring name), createFolder (Qstring name, Qstring Parent), addurl (KURL path, Qstring Parent), (Qstring path), renameitem (Qstring path, Qstring newname)</seg>
<seg id="1492">So it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then add files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop K3b K3binterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder dcop $PROJECT createFolder / foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder dcop $PROJECT createFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder test dcop $PROJECT create</seg>
<seg id="1494">& audiocreator; is an audio CD; reader for & kde; with him can easily be read and stored in MP3- or OGG files. also other formats are possible, depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& audiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (compressed) to MP3, oggenc for OGGs and FLAC (lossfree compression). currently, lame for MP3, oggenc for OGGs and FLAC (lossless compression) are required. further coders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, select the title of the & CD; read and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these WAV files (generally one per title) compressed into the MP3- or OGG format or other formats like the lossfree FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, read out the & CD; it is compiled by & Audiocreator; cdparanoia. almost any distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this has to be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggpreuntil (for OGG) or other coders have already been installed, so it is probably not necessary to compile yourself. however, only the codec packages are needed, but if FLAC is not used, the installation will not be required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">What encoding / file format should be used? the chapter of the Kodierer gives a small introduction to codiers, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, uses & audiocreator; cdparanoia, to read out audio data from the & CD; if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device is not possible, it is not possible to handle an protected audio CD; it is not possible to avoid the mechanisms of copy protection. simply avoid the purchase of copy protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While the setup may only be made (the setup dialog can be called as often as often as a suitable configuration. this leads to the hard disk. this leads (hopefully) to understand the slim approach of the user interface, which can be regarded as frequent in the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which coders are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc.)</seg>
<seg id="1504">It can collect & CD; information from freedb from the internet or can work completely without network, whereby everything is recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of commands of the main window. on the page, there are further information about how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the register maps for the configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The CDDB request will start the CD-data according to the setup tab CDDB. (this can be locally or online, in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be produced.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - when a encoder is configured in the tab code parameter Settings - the coding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoder, so that the selection can be read with another Encoder as the standard. it is recommended that before the encoder is configured in tab settings.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager so that a already read file is selected to encode a full & CD; read and encode.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of alerts (such as protocols, piepsen) for programming (such as reading & CD;) to configure.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main entry dialog of & audiocreator; with different card cards (like Encoder, to set the Encoders). here you have to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, coding and compression ratios and helps you choose the right codiers.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is lost, a loss-free audio format is required. apart from FLAC, there are also other such as' shorten 'or' Monkey 'which may be available for this distribution. disadvantages are low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats, the information caused by data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may today have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bitrate the differences will produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'Not so 'free, lame is still supplied with most distributions free but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high up to very high sound quality (with high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly lower quality for lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - when only music is to be heard from one computer or computer-based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG player devices is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special car stereo systems. today - beginning 2009 - these devices usually support the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list with parameters to audio quality and resulting compression ratios for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting provides good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting was usually sufficient for most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency, and has quite high quality. good enough for stereo audio systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 up to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. requires up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate of about 5.5. some older devices need CBRs. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for stereo audio systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate around 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of a titels. good enjoyment for music from youngsters, portable devices and auto-travel systems. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting is overdrive for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the absolutely highest quality without feedback on the file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information provided by the freedb via the Internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / needed / used with & audiocreator; and the code reader to create folder and file names and the features of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with Kodierprograms, there are often a combination of program settings for the codiers and these parameters here. the manual or help to the Kodiers explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; titles are to be encoded when MP3s with lame has to add lame and the title parameter of & audiocreator; the result looks as follows: '-tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & audiocreator; parameters, which can be used (= button name in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database, in which the audio CDs can be uploaded, so that all others can download this information instead of itself in the computer: & CD; titles, artists, names of the pieces & etc., not by the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal but I (Anm of the Ueberster) is not attorney. however, no one can extract the information without the & CD; more or less valuable, so the artist cannot be added to the music company. all information can be found in a ummel by a & CD; business, physically or virtuell.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & audiocreator; is active to select a check box (sending an address). in this type of configuration, it seems, the email address is not used when calling the data from the server (This may only know the programmer that has the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are in many countries copies of the main database. if & Audiocreator is used to use freedb, the geographical location of the next mirror server will be used. this saves bandwidth in the network and resembles the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror attachments for the online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, the entire database can be downloaded or (usually issued monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which program is used to store pieces from the & CD; saved in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There is rumours that cdparanoia is used; who wanted to be more precise, searching in source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; please note that the cdparanoia package must be first installed first if this is not done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To store the utilized WAV files, the coding can be selected for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lossfree compressing for audio data) to register the codile. other coders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The coding package must be installed from the appropriate Linux distribution before the codierer can be used. this is also necessary for the predefined codiers. more information about Kodierer are in the chapter caterer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a codile, further information on his switch can be obtained through the input of a command -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). it must be replaced by the name of the installed Kodierers.</seg>
<seg id="1540">That can have many causes. check the device of the device model of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and readers of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc.) are installed. try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal. this could indicate what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check out the case of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this will be how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, all understood but are not somehow to do something? well, no problem, follow this step by step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas, which will make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, all recorded and our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to use MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 sample (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">It must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found as it is not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files what you can do of course.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please ensure that the directory / usr / share / cd set, and that you have write permission to it (eg. copy you to copy with the queror anything).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setup of & audiocreator; something which is thought to be done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the way to read out a & CD; what must be repeated for each out & CD; it must be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the used codiers to compression music (lame) and the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 up to 256 kbps). since we are lazy to use the program to use the freedb and download the data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably change it very likely to read out any & CD; if once the matching settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device designation is handed over to the reader program to read the & CD; -data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently, / dev / cdrom a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive. if this is not working or if more than a & CD; / DVD drive can also be used, if the disk with other programs can also be accessed using other programs, the device records for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">Map Card General settings. here you can do not much to do. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything becomes so bellow as shown in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only for incomplete information, please note that you will be informed when information about sample files (tags) are missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; Settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and leave the & CD; data automatically via the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected during reading & CD; it can be connected to the Internet to access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is simpler, a & CD; entry found, starts immediately to read out & CD; this can be easily changed with the database entry and the resulting directory name / filename or day entries, you can change easily and the ID3 tags with Kid3, dem & kde; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, if you want to enter everything manually, you can use the selection areas and freedb. however, this is more than 620 MB large, but you can use it twice if you want to use freedb in the offline mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following card card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us freedb. these are settings for the data request, for the retrieval of the & CD; information from the freedb server on the Internet. how knows the system that data can get the CD? read the section about freedb. set everything as shown in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we have not downloaded the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to the freedb.org and look at a mirror server in your way. on this way, the load will be distributed between the machines. this setting is however the first attempt to work.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equivalent to the server, as many firewalls will boot the protocol 8880 standard, there is perhaps more luck with the protocol 80 because the & HTTP; Protocol is usually open to surf the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we want no & CD; data to the freedb server. the first check box should be enough.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings of screen photo. (make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneous pieces: excuse, there is a reason why more than one at the same time when using an existing drive? parallelreading and encode? the author knows it not, therefore just try.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece: cross this to the & CD; throw out at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom file for temporary files: if you can cross this checkbox, then the path / folders can be saved in which WAV files can be stored. if the box is not crossed, the files will not be checked in the private folder, if you don't forget this folder when you want to create something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All such as it is on the screen photo. the command is somewhat long, under circumstances it must be blotted to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of MP3s. as previously mentioned, it is sufficient for very good audio quality, even for very good stereo set stereo systems. the resulting rate factor is 6.3 to 256 kpbs. it's a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for the restriction of the creation of tags on version V1 / V1.1st 'ID3v2' tags can be used when needed. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tagger for & kde; in case of later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the complete path) and output file (including the complete path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Use the rest as in screen photo. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously to costing WAV files: when a Dualcore or Quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can be tried to encode more than a WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is, we have just completed the basic setup of & audiocreator; this configuration will be used as standard for each read of a & CD; if you have chosen the organisational structure of your music, you will never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section it is described as the process of reading the & CD; we will create MP3 files. first, we are being organized on the internet, as we are convenient to pick up and the & CD; data from the freedb. the process of which is described in this section must be repeated for each output & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we are a & CD; they are not included in freedb, look at the screen photos a little different than the data for a & CD; so you will learn the & CD; data manually, instead of retrieve it from the internet. comments are displayed on the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Don't try the & CD; this example is to find. it is a 'special' issue of the author's manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not done, now the & CD is now being defined in the drive that has been defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in screen photo. this only if the & CD; as audio CD, could be identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, then check in the section questions and answers to the previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD will be picked up by the freedb, all titles of the pieces are already completed and also the name of the artist and the album is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="1581">For the case there is more than an entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; -key for your & CD; there will be a window embedded, and you can select the database entry, which will fit your opinion best to your & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not have the check box for automatic query of freedb (on the page & CD; Settings in dialog for Settings), you can also manually fill out this manually by selecting the first button in toolbar. if you don't have any local database, you will need to collect the data from the internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 2: the CD Editor - Input of the CD data and song of the first unit</seg>
<seg id="1584">Type the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen photo. the title of the unit in the first line of the input field 'actuator', the rest of the data in the input field 'album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist does not have to be entered in the input field 'actuator title' unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower commentary box can be used for the single comments of inidiers per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments which are common to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieve of the data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it is always a good idea to review the content of the CD-Editors (e.g. all words with grandletters or not...) but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use ID3v1 tags. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & audiocreator; maximum allowed. this option is set on the tab code settings; take a look at the section 'basic settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the day information of the generated files later with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all codiers or file formats. see the coefficient for coding to obtain more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry, which is obvious to the style of the created CD; in this example, this is not important because we do not transmit the & CD; data from freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example can be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' come back to the main window. click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD-Editors appears and you will see that the fields for the album has already been recorded with the entered data, which we have listed for the first piece of data. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current denomination. simply select the titles of the piece to any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click the next line in the main window and process you to the same way until you have entered the title data of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window will not appear when you have downloaded the data from freedb. you have already been sorted into one of these categories in the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third knob of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the log list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check sign before each line of a piece. only the titles are selected to choose one or out. make sure that all pieces are selected, or check the button All pieces select at the bottom edge of the screen to choose all pieces at one time.</seg>
<seg id="1598">If the click on the button selection starts, this window appears to confirm the confirmation. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the riders orders to switch on the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly below the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is currently read on the hard disk. the status of the program will be displayed in the lower part of the window at the bottom part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1601">You can see this error message if you are trying to work with a codierer you have not yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully coded with a red'X 'in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the tmp file and target folders are not what we have entered here in the example. did you checked if you have a write access to the folder for temporary files and target folders?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it's clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: mission 4 is the encoding of pieces 1 into the format MP3. so you can read and encode parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program does not have any configuration settings to read this behaviour. the only thing that seems to read and codified the result is unclear. the used calculator with a AMD64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and encode (however two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read, while another piece is coded, and a third order in the queue of the body is coded. after the last piece is coded, a little window will be embedded with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & audiocreator; you will need & kde; 3.x or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you need the coding of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">& audiocreator; is now available within the & kde; CVS, as part of the kdemultimedia-package. however, you can download an anonymous copy, as a part of an important & kde; package is a part of an important & kde; -packages. if you read this, you probably have done it...</seg>
<seg id="1609">This section is addressed to individuals who compile the source files and are not intended for users who use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are searching for assistance how the program can be adjusted to your needs if it runs once, then the following is right for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls many different programs, has many variants of settings. best read the step by step example to get the options and settings. it shows screen photos of the different card cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hello, always read on? even if only the help menu click on the initial start of the program, without any reference point as it should go on from this somehow empty screen (especially if there is no audio CD; in the drive), or from the unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">Worum it goes? who reads this, probably already the program started. it should look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no e-mail. the author can't stop this manual. it is thought as the first version for a guide to & audiocreator; it is thought to do. at least only after contact with the author. and if you read this section, he has let this section and therefore agree with this suggestion.</seg>

<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; a piece play, you can jump on any spot by using the middle mouse button and drive with the knob and drive.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find out that a song is too fast or slowly off, you can click on the left and right of the speed display and then change the speed speed. to get the original speed, double click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The Leertaste has two tasks: if a piece is played, a pressure on the button break or select the menu entry break in the menu, so interrupts the playback. if no piece is played, starts & kmid; playback will start.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored on two ways in a piece of music. some pieces use Texts, others use lyrics and other both. some pieces have no text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can adjust what events will be determined and even better: the event type is automatically determined, so that you can manually adjust the karaoke text, but you still have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other kind.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set a event type, select from the menu settings the entries text gradients or forgings. the same function also have the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you summarise. these are the series to play in this section as you can efficiently use collections.</seg>
<seg id="1635">In order to win a collection, open the collection manager. these can be found in the menu collection below the point. click on New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by copying them on copying and then specify the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs like the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than a collection, you can set the desired information about the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection all songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection will not be saved. consider that if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, she must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song with the button. there is again the file dialog, which you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the setup of automatic adding to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic add to the collection is enabled, a piece when opening (using file opening or drag & drop) is automatically added to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">When automatic add to the collection, it is activated, when opening a piece the temporary collection, then it will be added to open pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click on Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the sequence where the songs can be played. if you select the row after the submenu of the menu window, the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add songs or remove any random order in the menu, the sequence will be defined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump a song, select the button next song, the entry next song from the menu or press the arrow on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song back to jump, select the button 2 piece, the entry would previous piece from the menu or press the arrow on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection and click on the button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection can't be deleted. however, this doesn't matter if it is not saved by & kmid; it is not saved.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is necessary to synthesizer that are not General-MIDI-capable. in this case, MIDI-Map General-MIDI events is translated into events that understands the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the Change patch to Bright piano in events of the Change patch to Trumpet type and thus always a trumpet sound, if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have just a sound card you don't need MIDI map because all soundcards GM are compatible (incl. Awe - and CIS cards, FM and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There is no programs to create MIDI-maps. you need to process the appropriate file from hand (with your favourite ditor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that saves all necessary modifications to play one piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the KEYMAP section, which may appear as often as desired. prerequisite is that every appearance has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Source PATCHMAP... END define KEYMAP "name of Keymap..." END define KEYMAP "A further Keymap..." END DECHANNELMAP... END options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that it is needed to show that a section starts (except for options) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an e-mail to which I have in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are not General MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section it is specified as the patches from General MIDI to your specific keyboard are shown. the general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equalling is ignored. it is believed that the GM will not change in the right order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and also no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional all-KeysTo M is used to create all sounds which supports this instrument (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to a defensive effect. with this, you can also bear the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So, if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 (defensive net), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of what sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the concept Drum patch of the patch is meant, with each tone a different percussioning instrument (drum, basins, Maracas & etc.) and not the one, with the tone the pitch of the always same drum means (as some keyboards own).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to specify such as sounds at a certain channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As the PATCHMAP section is the order of lines very important, as their presence. you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple Keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use various names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to form tones on the percussion channel. check out as an example the supplied Keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to convert some channels to others. if you want to exchange the first and second channel, you can simply do this easily in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards which have perkussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is listed on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the Keymap must be used in the file. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, try to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x is used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Forcepatch option can be useful for example to use the percussionist patch on the percussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderratio can be multiplied in which ratio pitch Bender events will be multiplied by the value n, this with the formula n * (r / 4096) is converted and then only forwarded. the value 4096 is used to be installed in the map file in the Map-file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM is needed to play a pitch Bender event with the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, however, some Keyboards get up to one octave higher. in order to find the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, just open the dialog for MIDI Settings. these can be found in the menu under Settings, Point MIDI Settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with all the clavies (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you can see which sounds are just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you have changed one instrument. if you have an instrument change, the button is no longer green but red, to display that no more the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (until now) has two different views to display the played tones. view the viewpoint settings below the Point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The Tempo-LCD shows the speed that a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the speed of a song. if you find such a song be too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the pace, use the arrows to the left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A file containing MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece must be played. it also contains the notes, rhythm, speed, & etc. thus, the same MIDI file can lead to very different results, the same as two different musicians can play the same notes on very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't be able to use & kmid; but with a good synthesizer you need a similar sound quality. in addition, you can also change a similar sound quality. in addition to a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc. you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">That may happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) of & kmid; it happens because & kmid; without AWE support, you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's home)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree to support & kmid; drag & drop. just open the folder that you want to add into & conqueror;, select all files from, and drag them to the & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Simply disable the adjustment of automatic add to the collection. otherwise the files are added to temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can see the arrow button on the left from Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the standard tempo you can click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have seen on a & mixed lot; -windows with my MIDI file and & kmid; if I want to play a karaoke file, or if I want to play a file, merely go into the & conqueror; -window to change and drag the file into the window by & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file quickly, without having to add to a collection, turn off the adjustment of automatic add to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. please do not only want to play the first file. so, adjust the setup automatic add to the collection and open a temporary collection, then exactly these a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then unlock the B.mid and C.mid version and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. all many thanks! when I see this songs you hear or see the postcard, animated me further on & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& Kmid; has been written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; at the moment I'm not much free time for my hobbies, but I try to take a bit time for my hobbies. as hobbies, I try to collect MIDI files, music make music and phrases.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where you want to download MIDI / karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you simply want to make me happy, send me an e-mail: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrais.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really do a huge anticipation, if you send me a postcard from your home or a MIDI- / karaoke file of a local group. if you want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file, you should contact me if you have a MIDI file, but you might have to contact me as I might have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; it is completely written in my free time and I would like to make money a lot of money. I therefore would like that I only want to score users, because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or e-mails).</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer because the sound quality depends on your sound card. it is not the same if you use a FM device or AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you have no sound card, you have to compile & kmid; with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it runs when you would have a sound card, except that you can't listen to music.</seg>

<seg id="1709">The application window is made of called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. alternatively, there is a window with the playlist. and finally there is a information window that will only be displayed when information is recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to specify the preferred connections below the menu. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the Category Dauerhly playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarchestufe. if you copy an entry, its group and all its subsets to the current category copies and playback starts with the requested entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', television and continuous playlist, can also be changed by direct editing of XML Configuration files. of course, the various files can be changed, but also by application itself. simply click on a name of a category clicks, on the menu click here and as next processing mode. by clicking a sub-group, only the XML content will be shown this part.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, the menu must be chosen with playlist, or select either the processing mode or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost if the processing mode is selected or another group is selected without the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Following the convenience of the author of & kmplayer; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation when starting and loading can be deactivated by editing of ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayc and change from [General option] No intro = 0 obab option to '1'. if the option is not available, it can be easily inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate one other animation. & kmplayer, the files ~ / .kde / kmplayer / st.xml and ~ / .kde / kmplayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation at the starting point doesn't need to be short, it will automatically terminate through the opening of another source. this would be annoying with the end-animation, but the user can therefore end the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start-animation can be the ads of a favorite photos: & lt; & lt; and lt; / / / home / Koos / mum.gif "fit =" Meet "and lt; /; /; /; /; /; /; /; In the spring package of & kmplayer; are in the directory tests / some examples of SMIL the of & kmplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a rider for configuring MPlayer in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer; here the path of the player and the interspace size of the data can be adjusted from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the toolbar by kmplayer. here's the output of mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this playback at the configuration dialog of & kmplayer; everything must be configured by manual loading of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayc. here is an example like a 'flash' with the module swfdec Mozilla.</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played within & kmplayer; it can even be played the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>

<seg id="1725">The conqueror or kmplayer; is available in a console application and after error messages concerning the loading of the browser module library to browse. if no error occur, the backend output is within & kmplayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">This is always an appropriate backend for a certain Mime type (of course only if this has been determined), this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayc. for example, phonon all ogg files are used:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& kmplayer; can play TV cards, either by using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer), which can be configured to use the device and the TV channels. it can be used manually from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (Video Data recorder) settings in the kmplayer is the dialog for Settings - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there should be sure to be selected from which one is selected (e.g., it is PAL for Western Europe), the correct name probably has a DVB in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of kmplayer is only able to work XVideo (probably this type of playtime video devices under Linux can also work only on the first screen (: 0.0). for this reason, the video forlinux extension refers to the X server. for the XFree86 server you need to include the following in his configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>

<seg id="1777">As soon as the above source code was entered the & latex file; the easiest way is to be compiled. the easiest way is to use the MenÃ ¼ s Building or the button quick construction.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored before the compilation. & cile; for storing the storage.</seg>
<seg id="1779">The compilation of the document must be sought after the errors in the protocol. when using quick construction, & eyepiece should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the protocol also should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (English) is a text that will be treated differently than the remaining document. for example, a report with the font is made 12. the command\\ Begin {environment},\\\ and\\ End {Premature Ejaculation} shall be a copy of the font only within the surrounding area. (in English).</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes will only be paid within the environment (from\\ Begin {environment} to\\ End {environment}). there is no decision type (number) for changes in the environment within a environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many varieties available to read the readability and user-friendliness of the document. it is possible for example, certain fonts, lashing pressure, sub-submissions, etc. these commands are either with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ Begin {emph}: this command is for short-intensive and is as long as long until it is closed with a\\ End {emph} or another environment. a single word in a set can be displayed using\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ Quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote begins with\\ Begin {Quote} and ends with\\ End {Quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After writing the source text by & latex; a step-step instruction for creating a document will follow in & styles.</seg>
<seg id="1786">As soon as the assistant was entered a bit text, a few adjustments were fulfilled for the better readability of the document. these should be a quote, a few places in the fat and spa printing and a poem to the application to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, by editor-View or Ctrl E can be returned to the editor (in the internal view). in an external viewer, its window must be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file created, the document can be printed or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file. easy to try and fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a balanced file format (English D e V ice I noses). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output like printers, & PostScript; / PDF transformer or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI; file the same steps as for creating the document must be displayed (see). in the 7th step - after clicking on DVI, then the document can be printed (if the printer is correctly set).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar enables the conversion of DVI; file into other formats. once the DVI; file created from the & latex; source code can be created, the conversion can begin in any other formats using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The preliminary search for the direct jump from the editor to the daisy position within the DVI; -file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& cile; offers a corresponding adjustment for all & latex; -binding files. for this purpose only Modern will be able to set up a... Tools construction.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To search for the anticipation, the mouse pointer can be positioned in a line of the source text and can be clipped on stock search. the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI; viewing takes place then.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; comes with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI; document the corresponding & latex; document by & kile; read and clarification; as text editor shall be specified as text editor... editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">Should the use of quick construction of the & DVI; viewing is not possible, an error can be found. if there is an error, this will appear in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The protocol file narrowns the error source in the source code. the log file is always used to view the error. in order to view the faulty line, the protocol has to be clicked on the error in the log-regulation, and jumps to the incorrect line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once on the respective knob in the toolbar, a window appears to choose from the appropriate template for the document. the pre-set mixes are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">In selecting from empty document, a document can either be written either by reason or the assistant to the quick creation of a new document. further information is included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">HÃ ¤utively user of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be stored in & cile; created, stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, it needs to be created either a existing & tex; - / Latex; -file created or create a new file. & cile; can create a new template using an existing document and selection of file template from document... create.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using the file, some strings can be replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables will be set in Settings... settings General.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own presentation, it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by what variables are:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by entering the documentation class. typically, it will be used as follows:\\ documentaries [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is the use of the Assistant and the associated entry into the editor. once the document has been prepared for the following steps:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, the own template can be selected instead of default.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files will be created. a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and will be displayed below the steps below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Kate; used & Kate; as an internal editor. & Kate; is a text editor for programmers with the readiness of reading and highlighting of many different types of text files (including also & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for & Kate; can be made out directly in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & Kate; the handbook of Kate will be attracted to Kate. users of & kile; users can start directly with reading the chapter of Works with the Editor & Kate.</seg>

<seg id="1815">Many assistants can be enclosed. this is an own kind of bookmarks within the text. the menÃ ¼ ge bezel give the jump to the most important or last jumping mark. this jumping stamp will also be highlighted, so that they will automatically acquire a character on the first input of a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The work is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as & cile;. although & Kate; important functions for the writing of a & latex; source codes for their selection. among them are listed below are the following commands to include text code:</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is a complete subsection (such as lines that contain on both sides a blank line). this extended meaning has been added to the tables, & latex; -commands and all other lines of the source text. the only visible thing in & cile; is that the space is separated by two empty lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">The word below the current cursor position. this selection has also a expanded meaning because this command is also & latex; commands with a lot of rooms (\\) and an enclosed star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">For example a part of the document can be removed from this first. & Kate; offers the key figure Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & cile; offers you own commands for a faster sensitivity. under processing, the following commands are included in the text:</seg>

<seg id="1824">If the cursor before or within the command\\ Begin {surroundings} is located at the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering a lot of elongated ambient commands, this command can be lost quickly. this command was close to the most recent environment, so that the scrapped environment structure is not scared.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& cile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups that are determined by brackets {...}. among the work teX group are some important commands that correspond to those in the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">With this command, the command is to start at the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). cursor is placed directly in front of the guesthouse.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command, the command is injected at the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). cursor is placed directly behind the attached cladding.</seg>

<seg id="1973">For & quantitative information; from version 3.3, the troubleshooting was completely redesigned. support for the non-built-in & PHP; (3) Debugger was discontinued as well as the support for the DBG Debugger. instead of its a debugger plugin concept was implemented, which enables different implementations about plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">At present, only one plugin is available, support for the use of & gubed; inquantitative;</seg>

<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP request to the server to initiate a debug request. this is equivalent to the use of a browser to watch the current document. the issue of this requirement will be displayed in the Debugger issue.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The debugger started to start with the execution of the script and information on the supervised variables as well as the currently completed line will continue. if this happens, the execution is continued, the script will start with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Points the debugger to start with the execution of the script file, without any information on supervised variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script was given, the execution begins, the execution begins as soon as a requirement is provided.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger leads the next order in the script without entering the functions or include files.</seg>

<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the day XML and clear whether they are necessary, or not. although not all necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible, so other users have a better insight and more information on work with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in easier manner.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a day XML document. it can contain only once in one document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but it can only contain any element type above itself.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tags is a script function. when using it, attr &gt; an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>

<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, an interface and a methodology name. the arguments that are handed over to the method. can be empty or% day name%, which means the name of the current tags.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container day that contains the elements of a list. it can only occur once a attribute description. it is an only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">The position of the attribute excretes of a tags within a dialog. this tag can occur once every attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; -day). the element is empty.</seg>

<seg id="2017">All day XML files must begin with a & XML; declarations start with & XML;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be tidy and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces influence nothing, but pay attention to & B & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt;, especially in elements such as & lt; toolbar &gt;, and lt; text &gt; will not be replaced, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To review the tagXML files, the tools dialog appears in & quantitative information; -window to start and check out TagXMLA. another dialog will appear, whose simple instructions will follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available yet. currently, check only when charging the tagXML files in & quantitative.</seg>

<seg id="2030">The first must be the name of the script and the interpreter. example: SH / home / myhome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptyourself variable in the command line: $KDEDIR / share / Quanta / scripts / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable which can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we replaced the URL of the current document. in case of a local document, file: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with the PID of the current & quantitative; process. if by & quantitative lus; only one instance runs, the text is distributed to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantitative script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameter for this event, normally the file name of the current document or the path to project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above method, a script can be obtained from & quantitative. in the selection box, input can be determined what is to be sent to the standard entry. possibilities:</seg>

<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can also be redirected. there are two types issue: normal output, based on the standard output file; error messages can be done with the default output written by which the value is specified by the value box issue:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups. it is necessary to create a custom toolbar for each group. in the case it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you have to add promotions and configure the actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are rather self-explanatory. press the new action button at the bottom end of the window starts scanning mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all the necessary fields and add them to the matching tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and if the day attributes has and you plan your use, activate the dialogue "tag, if available, so that a input should be possible when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is that a ugly icon. who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol? we replace it before we have difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action is better, we will use & kiconedit; choose from the & delicious, graphics further programs (or where otherwise it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol no just helps you to remember what the action does, but also all other users of the & DTEP;</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the day that the day is, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. due to the use of green (green is usually considered loose, rigid, further interpreted), or should be signalized at least, a message to the user will show this symbol no & lt; startup; -day in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it must be connected to the action. this happens via the menu with Settings... (in & quantitative;) and selection of the desired action. in addition to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the user button and put them on with other tags if there are, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some usual & quantitative; -functions to toolbar supplement or it should be shared to a better overview by some separator in several groups. open the toolbars a dialog for Settings toolbars. make sure the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the Trento (left above) for my tool bar. after selecting the element, which should be added to the toolbar, press the arrow button to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">I would like to make a quick way to access the queror preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note, as the Trento support the group. someone who doesn't know my tool bar could believe that the & conqueror; button on the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested through stimulation of all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure the right folder, after NeueXML does not exist, but your tool bar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please adjust their & descriptionrc; so that their toolbar will be loaded (s) if a file is open from the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most chosen expansion of & quantitative enlargement; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation to the script language or the formatting language that you like to do in love. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check back in & quantitative; -Repository whether someone has already done for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you have to search an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc. language. then you need to create the docrc file. we will need to handle the second part here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc You = Path, relative to this file, e.g. php42 / # Elements in the main index Top element = your description for these documentations, e.Sec2.3.html Section 2 = # Sec2.1, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec2.1, # Sec.tag1 = tag1.html tagn3 = tag.html 3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, see now in the & PHP; documentation as something:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE config file [Tree] Doc Download = php42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = .age.basic synthes.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. it shows that there are sub-folders in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the chess boards (except the understanding) mdash; but try it out.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents can be referenced directly to a file (and consistent, at the upper end of the building view & mdash; folders will be displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces do not affect nothing but pay attention & B & lt; signs. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantitative; Resourcendums will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The section of the docrc file is used to be displayed on the writing of a & PHP; the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function is to be displayed. by selecting the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context-help would be the documentation directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (Context List) and the file attachments.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separate text elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can store your file docrc simply save and proceed to $HOME / .kde / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / doc / quantity for local and global use. then create a folder (as if you specify this in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and it's worth to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information about the & quantitative policy; -Repository for use by the & quantitative lus; -community. you will not be rich, but are proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantitative, you are not alone. it is possible to divide resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can send us by email to friends, partners or otherwise. at different locations, there is a email address, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, email, in context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our head archive, from where all other & quantitative users can download. the contributions are checked and only available for publication if our team needs them as correct and useful for publication. to ensure a valuable contribution, the source of resources ensures that our team will be ensured, both our team as well as for the subsequent users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for their private GPG key (the Passphrase will not be saved), or in the case you can check out multiple keys. if you have multiple keys, the input fields must be filled (URL preview can be empty) and click OK to upload the upload button.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The upload may also be uploaded from the menus DTD DTD package (DTEP), toolbar toolbar, and in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, even before installing the resource, examines & quantitative. in case of problems, it can be warned. please note the warning messages carefully. if the integrity are given and the resource is correct, a message appears with the indication of the originator of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages, which is currently not able to work by a DTEP package, but it can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files in day XML format might be needed. there is the simpler way to convert a DTD automatically into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the menu DTD store and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description which should be used. afterwards the following dialog appears:</seg>

<seg id="2081">In & quantitative, there are some key concepts. to understand these concepts and full benefit from & quantitative. this chapter is trying to bring them exactly these concepts without their understanding and quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantitative, the working range is divided into three areas: global, local, local and projects. this distinction affects a number of components in & quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are for everyone, the & quantitative, uses, available. from toolbars over promotions is all that is marked as globally, in common folder structure of & quantitative. this enables the group of administrators to secure different toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree that will be available in any multi-user environment at the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local items provide a personal collection of web developments for a single user. these are custom patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in user directory, so that users can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be everything from & CSS; - designs up to toolbars with special promotions specifically designed for the files of a specific project. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which represents the common use of special tools and designs of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantitative; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the Editorwindow, the building prospects, the cartoning with information and toolbars. please strike in, and for further information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the Carteivans with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the latest documentation, such as close to the current, other or all Kartureiter, reload or upload the document, jump to a bookmarks or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click on the editors for a further context menu concerning the revised document content, such as basic processing steps (cut / copy / eings), editing the mouse under the mouse pointer or open the file, if the string below the mouse pointer a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the upper end of the editors are the display panels of the Editors. currently, & quantitative; 4.01 Transitional are displayed as standard, for which a set of tool bar is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantitative methods, the tool will be adapted to the new functions and thus connected user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert the symbol which represents the day, then click the data for this just entered day. if you want to insert the data for this straight day, you should fill out several attributes (such as anchors), you can fill in a dialog for different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The design views (QIT;) allow to navigate to the information and quantitative. in the representation of cartographers are available for files, project, templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation constructions available.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project Management is a powerful tool that provides & quantitative tool. this view shows all files in the project and allows you to manage files in the project via right mouse click. actions like add, removing, uploading or delete files from the storage medium can be performed with the then displayed context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another option of & quantitative lus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc. there are all possibilities open.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on which they are used. global templates are always available, local templates only for the relevant users and templates are only available in the project. more on templates can be found in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information on the available script languages. the concept of reintegration in Global, Lokal and Project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the available information on a script. via the right mouse button, further functions are available, such as the script to start or send an email to.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is placed on the position of the element. by right click of an element, a list of commands will open in terms of navigation and view of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears under the other main views. with it, manfast attributes and namespaces can change. the changes of all available attributes with a few clicks is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development. it can be downloaded documentation for & quantitative information; it can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project, project-specific documentation can be edited, edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantitative lus; two cartons at the bottom end of the window that can be reached via the useful information can be reached: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This Carteireiter shows information on each in Quanta running script. thus, e.g. the DTD of the current document and all changes to the DTD is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This Carteireiter shows all bugs in the market up of the current document. & quantitative information; scripts that are executed, enter all error messages (as there is) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantitative, tool bar are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they will receive the corresponding command. the chocolate page of the toolbar is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in & quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another feature of & quantitative, is the ability to send a toolbar by email. & quantitative information; sends the tool bar as a compressed Tar archive via & via mail; if they receive a toolbar in an email, they can secure this in & quantitative; like any other secure and charge!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the place of & quantitative policy; it has autoconf a number of options to get to the match script. to get a complete list of all options, enter. / configure ----help. the options are easy to understand and not performed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems at start & quantitative; you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folders. also you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in PATH in front of their bin folders. same applies to & Qt.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantitative, is a web development tool for KDE surface. & quantitative and is optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During the effort to create the best & HTML; editor, the developers of & quantitative idea began to deal with a standing, extendable Markup languages? well, this would be an absolutely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer on pure & HTML; limited, is & quantitative; now far on the way to a general and extensive web development tool. combined: if you can define it in & XML; then you should look at & quantitative; for this is the appropriate & IDE;</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the aforementioned claim must be noted that & quantitative policy; as a product is based on the outstanding efforts of free software, the idea of why? thanks to the & kde; rumor is not just this everything possible, but allows users and developers, & quantitative and developers; as they need for their needs.</seg>

<seg id="2124">Shows the symbol no left from the main window. this column allows you to set, bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">When the file is bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu with entries pre or next, depending on the position of the cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other open documents appear in the menu, after the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from hard drive. & quantitative project; Projects are stored with File Extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for insertion files into the current project. select the selected files will then be copied to project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this allows, e.g. graphics files in your project folder or a sub-folder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Load the files in your project on the server high. the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of & kde; from and whether you have downloaded further input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Attitudes, such as & quantitative lus; the project manages. in chapter & quantitative information; Projects are explained by details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Invites you a project certification. these are kept in project you / toolbars and are only available in this menu, if you have assigned them this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: locally or project.</seg>

<seg id="2153">This should generate a help according to the environment of the mouse pointer, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantitative, is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always support help. if they want to support & quantitative form; development in financial form, they find here the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be filled at the best from top to bottom, as for example, after filling the project, the whole directory structure is completed automatically. all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later with Shift; F7 project Project Properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering the name, file is checked automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantitative project; project file. by default it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with extension webprj (eg foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can use the server address of the machine that you want to access the local data. either a name (hostname.exempl.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you use this field empty, the default settings of the chosen protocol is used. depending on the computer's setup, a adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to project and standard templates. if a common collection of files are used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbars can be stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a joint collection of files are used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local file system into the project. multiple files or folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great when you have static website content you can download and change it. by serverside scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc.) one must be different.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Apply, when files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project are to be bound, if a project is newly started, not connected.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option all the files and folders are displayed inside the main board and you can make an accurate selection according to good fertilization.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files through Anhack, or by removing the heresy, clamps from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project assistants contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can also be uploaded in the menu with the project Properties in the menu window or with the button Shift Shift; F7 will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project assistants and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholder possible), which can be re-read in project-related operations like project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to top, even files that are listed in .cvsignal are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which will be loaded when opening the project. can be read more about projection views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">Thus the desired debugger can be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the debugger plugin can be set using the Options. in case the troubleshooting can be described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the subwindow profiles, high loading profile (see in) can be adjusted, as well as the display of a building view for the content of the server for each profile by using a dedicated building view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the subwindow team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the subwindow event configuration, you can switch event actions to change or delete these actions, if a specific event will enter, such as the sickness of a file. see in details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default & quantitative lus opens; the last project that was opened. this behaviour is currently not able to influence.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open a different project, select Project... from the menu Project or the icon project open from the toolbar. the dialog box will be displayed and allowed the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantitative lus; closed, the project file is automatically saved. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, when & quantitative. changed files. same happens if you need a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project management are free access to the files in the project. you can manage the files in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folder will be like, however, are missing the entries open and open with... in with the right mouse button Context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information on the place of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Enables removing of the current profile. if only a profile is present, the button is low to prevent removing.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in the kernel memory and if you forget it. this option is useful if it is necessary to upload files and rather uncertain password on the record -option does not occur in question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or leave the dialog if you change your opinion before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantitative profiles; can be created many high-loading profiles and thus making the project (or parts of the project) to be uploaded to different servers. when working or creation of a profile, this dialog will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server which should be copied to the files. either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed KIO slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (locally) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. usually this must not be changed, except the network administrator operates a service not on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use it to your discretion. the password will be stored on the plate, so that it can't be read easily, but each with programming language can be easily seen in the text-text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is just a set of files and toolbars. it can be done in a project many views, i.e. by simply changing the view, various files and toolbar can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be opened in the menu project or the project toolbar, accessible via Settings toolbar project toolbar, opened or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantitative us; with which one has to do most on most. this helps increase productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantitative. to the own work mode.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, toolbars in & quantitative; the best over the menu toolbar can be stacked. use and add. the add of toolbars will be treated below in the section of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the symbols can be set either by using context menu (right click on the toolbar), in which the new toolbar can be configured, toolbar, renaming or toolbars, which may be specified in the dialogue, where the actions can be visible on this or other toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to a action (symbol) on a toolbar, the entries can be removed and action indicated that are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings toolbars... and set the actions.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are in essential documentaries, code escalel and files to linking. & quantitative information; used templates basically as a common file system with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or any in the system existing directory in the preferences tree. templates have in & quantitative information; in about the restrictions you need for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantitative lus; provided templates have conditions for its use. please read the conditions stipulated in any template prior to use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is everything that it is not pure text. it can be binding any file from text, so images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; binbinary templates are usually inserted in documents via conlinings (e.g. images with IMG src = / src / url). some examples are available in the basic tree below global templates. further information on templates tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created from any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. usually, a simple report for the purpose and organises the work in appropriate way to be efficient. some examples can be found in the introductory tree below global templates. see in for more information about templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if you are not a new document based on a template but the same text area will always be inserted into documents. you can find everything from a comment on a final menu on Javascript or Perl basis. some examples are available in the basic tree below global templates. see in for more information about templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name suggests, these templates are used for whole websites as templates. you are a collection of various documents, which can be organized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure after exposure (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and select File As template when local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">As soon as it is done, notice that (even if it is stored as a project situation) the template is not visible in the project tree. look under project management.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click file as a template selection as local / project templates. alternatively, the selection can easily be drawn with pulling and off onto the building view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file is only enough to copy the file functions in a folder file, allowing all file management functions to be used, such as pulling and insert or add through the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">One can click on a folder or in the Project files building view onto a folder on a folder and secure a name for the template. by default, it will be backed by default folder, but of course it can be saved as local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates allow a very goal oriented approach mode. you can add headlines and footlines or dynamic with & PHP; in addition, some things can be used when using templates in projects very deep-green in the eye.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The structure structure in the subwindow template is based on the files created in $KDEDIR / share / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / Quanta / Templates / Quanta / Templates / Quanta / Templates / Quanta / Templates / templates / templates / templates / Templates / templates / templates / templates / Templates / templates / templates / templates / Templates / templates / templates / Templates / templates / templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates / Templates.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To determine the behavior of a folder where the right mouse button click on the folder and select the context menu properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is blown up, as soon as the attributes can be inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is activated by default and fits all common folders in the previous models. if a trunk folder would be set in principle, except they would be explicitly enabled. in case of a regular folder, the blah would appear with something like the text module. if nothing appears, it is likely to be found in a trunk folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows or presented text for templates in this folder. this could be general headlines or footlines for all templates for a particular project and allows to equip a whole presentation in a folder with special headlines / footlines to equip a whole presentation with the matching headlines / footlines.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, the context menu (shown on the right mouse button) have a full command set for adding folders or copy and add templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantitative; offers two modes: VPL; Editor and VPL; & Source Editor, which are accessible via the menu. the first mode replaces the source editor by the VPL; editor and the second share the editorial window in two parts: the source editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: he invites a document such as a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and when needed for source code editor, which are visible in the source code in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor in a document, the & PHP; contains a small green symbol the vohandy of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit this directly to the VPL; editor. there is no plans to change this behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works exactly like the first, besides that the changes are visible both in the source editor and the VPL; editor is enabled, and the cursor is activated in the source editor and in VPL; this mode is already active, pressing the active cursor from a window to the others, whereby the position is retained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between the VPL; editor and the source editor is adjustable via Settings Quanta.... After selecting VPL; -view it can be set between synchronization after one click or automatically. in general, the recommendation can be set automatically. basically, the recommendation can be set automatically. basically, the recommendation can be set for fast computers and a large range of span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of this website. this is the editing of invisible tags in work with the VPL; editor is also called, as soon as a new document with the VPL; editor will also be called. this allows the reduction of the hanging body. this means that you can change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. bwords for Internet search engines. metering elements can be added or removed by pressing the two switching surfaces below or be removed. one click into the list allows the change of inhalving, e.g. key words on the column name and keywords keyword 2 on the contents column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to design the extension of pages in the browser. you can add CSS rules with buttons under the list or delete. a change on the list is currently not supported on the meta elements.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to insert an external CSS styles by clicking on the file button and select the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursor is as in a text processing, caused by reference to the arrows. under rare circumstances, the cursor behaves as usual. text can be inserted by intipping and easily extinguished by button or swift.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The insertion of tags will be made in the same way about the toolbar, as in the source text editor. it is noted that the insertion of tags previously already existing identical tags is not removed, e.g. if an anchor is inserted, each other ambient air is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars like the tables-assistant or the lists-assistant are deactivated. they will work later in & VPL; in this release, the tables or lists toolbar must be used.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for the investigation of styles. in contrast to other programs for styles is the search for certain elements possible and the execution of styles can be pursued.</seg>

<seg id="2269">Start a shell. enter the & xsldbg; command "help" to obtain an overview of the help.</seg>
<seg id="2270">Add the parameter with the name & lt; and the value & lt; VALUEgt; add to the XSL ambient variable. see also the documentation on the command "addressing"</seg>
<seg id="2271">Performs the conversion 20 times if --repeat is repeated two times, the conversion will be 100 times</seg>
<seg id="2272">The input instruments are treated as HTML files when the support has been activated in libxml</seg>
<seg id="2273">Activates the XInclude processing of the input box when the support has been activated in libxml. this is enabled as default.</seg>
<seg id="2274">On systems with installed Readline library, you can connect to the commands access to / from the expiry date of the previously carried out commands.</seg>
<seg id="2275">Several commands require more than a argument. claim signs can be used to pass the expressions as an argument. & eg;: with the command "break & quot; * _ BAR _ @ quot;" as argument is a holding point in a file named "break & quot; * _ BAR _ @ quot;."</seg>
<seg id="2276">Template _ name: a valid name of a template that consists only from the ASCII characters 0x00 to 0x7F. this name can be a completely qualified name as "XSL: templateName."</seg>
<seg id="2277">Filename: a valid local file name on the system of the user. on Unix- or Cygwin systems, the name may have the prefix "~" as a short form for the personal folder. on RISC-OS systems are also more ambient variable.</seg>
<seg id="2278">Path: a path to changing the workpiece. on some operating systems the prefix '~' is replaced by the path to your personal folder.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Data: the XML-data or XML _ document, which is processed by the styles. see also & lt; FILENAMEA; and lt; URIgt;</seg>
<seg id="2280">Running time commands: {bye _ BAR _ exit _ BAR _ Quit}, step, stepup, stepdown, next, continue, run, trace option, options</seg>
<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for the same. why so & diff3;? let me explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributions made many changes and simultaneously corrects the entry. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result were numerous conflicts in collision.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me only showed me the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines. and there was no evidence for the positions, where perhaps only the influence was changed. the merge of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could be differentiated within a line and changes to white characters. later, any quantity of more useful features were added later.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare text quickly, copy it to the clipboard and add it in one of the comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparisons and merge of folders. this function turned & crdiff3; almost in a fully-known file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way collateral is fully supported. this is useful if two persons can work independently of one piece of code and changes. in this editor, you can even edit the result. in this editor, you can even process the result directly. the screen photo shows three quell files when merge:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& diff3; also helps you to compare and merge folders. this screen photo shows & diff3; with the folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& diff3; displays exact differences and diversified in the ways of today's color monitors. if you often have to check asde, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tobacco are visible. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters, you can see at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no trouble if anyone changes the objection.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other distinguishes itself in one line, then the colour indicates that the file is different. red color means that both files are different.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same names, but in different folders, you can make up the tiff work by simply write the file names of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Diff3 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The opening dialog allows manual winding of file names, selecting from the file-browser (file...) or select an last open file from the opening times. the opening dialog will indicate your choice; if you do not need to specify the entry for C, the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the button folder... you can also select a folder where you can select a folder, if you select a folder, the same or merge of folders will be selected, for B and C, however, use & diff3; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If assembly is crossed, the input field is active for target and editing. however, it is not necessarily required to determine an output file immediately. you can do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before using the same / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you would like to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text compare. & diff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard to the active comparison window. in opening, you don't need to select files, you can simply close the dialog box with the abrupt button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use Zies and Able: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from a editor and let it fall over a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What thought is behind it? sometimes contains a file e.g. several similar functions. if you want to figure out how similar these functions are, that would be a relatively large effort. you would like to compare and compare these relevant sections, and then compare these relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you can extract nothing out of & diff3; only the flames of text is supported in a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the pulling and removal of text into another program as slicing and insert (instead of copying and insert). in such cases your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of any text window, the info line of the source code contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that windows C is optional). (if the path is too long), let the mouse allow for a while over the line. then a small auxiliary window will show the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three sources are assigned to the letters A, B and C. A has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (this default settings can be changed over the settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, one can distinguish on the color, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files. this is good in the next section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">On the left next to the text is the column-column. if differences were found, the colour is not so important. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see the relevant changes. (at C / C + +, e.g., white characters are only in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few, rare individuals.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line, which separates the collateral column is interrupted by the text, where the source file does not have lines. if the line is activated, the line will be displayed on the broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (below the comparative calculation) also has an Info line with the inscription output:, the filename and [Gechanges] if you have processed the result. usually, it contains the automatic result, but often also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!!! until all conflicts have disbanded, the saving is disabled!!! (use the buttons to take root solving / unexpectation conflict around the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparisons are used, each difference must also be solved at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the window, the group is marked in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed. this group will then highlighted the current group. this group is highlighted by color background color for current area and each on the left is a black beams.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, through the automatic merge or by manual loading, no further line will be left in the text, then you will change your mind and perhaps again another source. this text appears not in the final stored file, yet in a marking which may perhaps copy and add differently.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; abstraction conflued; however, in the clipboard, if you copy such text from the chapter window. go carefully with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if the sources select the options are ignored or Ignoriere C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">This will navigate mainly to the image run and mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you are in one of the window, you can use the arrow keys left, right, at the end, Ctrl at the beginning and Ctrl end, Siw, as you can also use it from other programs. if you can also click here to Navigate.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye window, you can also use the other keys to work. using the insert button, you can switch between instruction and transfer mode. (default is the plug-in mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group (as already in the section) and the editable issuing window was explained).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the current / previous difference (Ctrl-down / Ctrl-picture), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-down / Ctrl image downhill) or to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-down / Ctrl-picture), even after manual dissolving conflicts has to be distinguished between dissolved and unintentional conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marking in clipboard, you need to copy the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-insert). if this option is enabled, it will be automatically copied to the clipboard and it is careful if you might write to the content of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Zeilenches are stored according to the regulated operating system\\ r\. KDiff3 reserves the line-line\\ r\. KDiff3 reserves the line-end of the source files, therefore you should use & diff3; also do not use binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of the recently used files will automatically be saved and re-produced during the next start. (menu Insulation - &gt; KDiff3 setup...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialogue also provides fonts with variable width, but you should not use it.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences in cursive script will be displayed. if the selected writing is not supported, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">In systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be represented. in these systems, the button presets automatically introduces an uncontrolled color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is enabled, the tab button is inserted the corresponding number of spaces. otherwise, a tabulator sign will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press entering or Return, the submission of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is activated, each selection will be automatically copied to the clipboard. the manual is then discharged in the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which Zeiling type you prefer to store. the default value is the commonly usual selection of the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When using files, try & diff3; first, all completely identical lines will be ignored in the source files. in this step, white characters can not be ignored. in this step, white characters are not ignored. even during merge, white characters are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a wagon mark '\' at the end of a line, others again save one line-cub '\'. usually, however, files with different sizes in the page-to-page comparison look identical, but as if this option is enabled, this option needs to be disabled. in default, this option is deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2331">The default option is deactivated this option. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated characters are ignored, but the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The default option is deactivated this option. changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensive after even smaller differences are looking for. the option is activated in the default. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the automatic-step mode, this setting is determined, as long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next open conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Automatically dissolves all conflicts in white characters by using the chosen file. (default is manual selection.) that is useful if the automatic selection also should be solved in numbers or comments, if the options are ignored in numbers or comments, if the options are ignored or Ignoriere C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are described in the chapter on scanning of folders and guides. look for details under documentation to the directory comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already an older version exists, then the original version is the suffix .original mount. if already such a backup file is created with Suffix .original, this is without any further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adjusts the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current program. you must stop & be restarted, making the change is active. (this option is not available in KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set to the global control centre there.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following coding settings can be set separately for each entry, when this option is activated, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">On the selection fields for coding, a short notice of what the local coding is. (this can't be changed here and has an informal character for you.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Customize the file code for source files. this is how special characters are treated and interpreted can be interpreted individually. since the encoding for each file can be adjusted individually, even files can be compared with different coding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have a file, you can define which coding is to be used to store.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing, they could not work with your codec. (for example, your files may work 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle with 8-bit ASCII.) using this option you can define the encoding of output files.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn off this way to suppress the illings of changes into white characters in the text or review levels. (note: this applies to changes in numbers or comments when the options are ignored or Ignoriere C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is available only if you compare three files. in normal mode all differences between two of three files are displayed. after selecting from A & B; -gt; B, A & B & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C is displayed next to the normal only supremise column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines. simply click the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Returns the comparison window side or overlap. this can also be useful for displays of long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes, consider the differences and decide to merge the files using the merge menu, even if you want to compare files from the last source file as a default name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">While reading a file it will be delivered to this external command. in & diff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor, which is exactly your needs. you can remove this function e.g. for out-cut parts or to correct the entry.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file it will be delivered first to this external command. if also a normal pre-processing command was specified (see above), the issue of command is used only when using a line output. you can write your own preprocessor, which corresponds to exactly your needs. each input line must have an associated output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The thought behind it is to enable the user more flexibility when ordering the diff results, but most users don't want to program it. however, the good news is that SED or perl is completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command for tick-off to convert the input into large letters: SED's /\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ Change the found text in the first cline pair. the\\ U converts the found text in uppercase.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some key words around automatically generated character strings (info: / cvs / keyword substitution). all follow the same pattern $\\ _ BAR _ _\\ $\\ _ BAR _ Author\\\ _ BAR _ _\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you have to experiment with SED, you might get to understand it and perhaps like this regular expressions even. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">That's ignored by numbers is actually a built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for a further processing command set for line off. SED's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every sign between' ['and'] 'is a suitable matches, and each hits will be replaced by nothing, thus virtually be deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several requirements at one time. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the requirements of each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of SED you can also use something different such as perl. perl -e 's / REGEXP / replacement / switch' allerdings are different from perl. where SED\\ (and\\) needs perl only (and) without the leading '\\'. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal pre-processing will be retained for display and merge. further operations change only the data that the ignition angle equals-algorythmus.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases if you use a normal preprocessor, the line-off-preprocessor sees the output of normal preprocessor.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function, the text changes or differences, you can't notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmer to process many files in one folder. for this reason, you can compare with & diff3; complete folder recursively compare and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes for each object a proposal to merge; you can customize the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate and simulate the simulated changes, without they do it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... will select selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is similar to the same and merge of individual files very similar. you only need to specify a folder on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders will be merged, then folder 1 is used as a basis. if no target folders is used, & diff3; folder 3 as target folders.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically, not the merge. to start the merge, you must press the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (more details follow).</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder you informs you a little news window about the current progress. if you start scanning the folder, only the files are listed, which were compared to then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">If the scanning of the folder is complete, displays & diff3; a Listing window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and each folder that was found during the scan is displayed here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click here.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder is normally folded up. you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object or use the arrow buttons for left / right. the directory menu contains two features All subdirectories flaps and all subdirectories can fold with them all the folders or flaps.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double click on a file, the file comparison will start and it appears a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folder, then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window on the selected object. in such cases the merge tool can not be selected automatically. if the assembly is started, you will be informed about problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above picture, the A / B / C contains the colours red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">With identical entries, the color is also identical, even if the age of entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical if its entire content is identical. then also folders are the same color. with folders, the age is unsignificant for its colour.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea to this color scheme is based on dirdiff. colours reflect the colors of a leaf, which is only green, then yellow becomes and later when it is old, red becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C identical but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>

<seg id="2386">When two folders are merged and select the newer file instead of merge (insecure), then examines & diff3; the date of files are different, but the same date will appear differently, but the date is identical.. such as such bugs are not removed, the merge can't be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During the merge, a file is working according to the other. it has a status column indicates that when the collision was successful, and correspondingly other messages when collateral is finished, you should make a last review and see if the status is everywhere in order.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If the dialog box dialog is selected, KIs 3 further columns. these include the number of Comforter, dissolved, not white and white conflicts. (the column for dissolved conflicts will only be displayed if three folders can be compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge either the just selected entry (file or Odner), or all entries at one time. if you have selected all intermittent actions (even in all subfolders), you can run the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Note: if you have no target folders then, in the three-folder merge mode C, the target is used as a target and used to synchronize A and / or B as a target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you select a target folder, please check if all entries should be displayed in the target folder, even in the folder file, there are some options due to certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directories start / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the key root). to perform only the current entry: choose action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If by contradictory file types there are still invalid merge actions, a message appears to be displayed on the incorrect elements. you can choose to select a valid promotion.</seg>
<seg id="2394">If you merge all entries, a dialog window will run with the options, emulate and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you would like to see what would happen to happen without the really changes. you will then get an extensive list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& diff3; then add certain actions with all entries. if a manual procedure is necessary (merge to a single file), then a merge window will open (please note the screen photo).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are ready to start with a file, choose a directory entry / continue or press F7. if you are not yet saved, a corresponding dialog appears. then leads & kdiff3; his work will continue with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">When & diff3; on an error, a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list, you can try to skip the cause of the problem. if you want to try to navigate the cause of the problem, or to solve the problem, or to solve the problem in any way, before you proceed with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries were logged together, see & diff3; these entries (in the current session) and leads them not even again. even if the merge has not been saved or not saved, these entries will be considered. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & diff3; (Settings - &gt; KDiff3 setup...) has now a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that fit onto the samples are displayed in the element tree. you can use multiple patterns. separate placement holders: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folder must not comply with this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that correspond to this design are not displayed in the element tree, use the semicolon; as a separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that correspond to this design are not displayed in the element tree, use the semicolon; as a separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that are also ignored by CVS. many autismatic files are ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this folder can be configured with a .cvsignal file. (look at info: / cvs / cvsignal.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files are encoded - attribute. this option lets you decide whether these files will be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2406">With links to files: if the option is switched off, symbolic shortcuts are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to the links. this is deactivated in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">With links to the folder: if the option is switched on, the links like normal folders are treated and recursively searched. (note that & kdiff3; not on possible complaints would lead to a folder that would lead to an end loop and add & crdiff3;) This option is shut down in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">A complete analysis of each file through and displays the statistics-columns. (the number of dissolved, unComforter, non-white and white conflicts.) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and considerably slower when it is applied to files that contain no text. (give an appropriate anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders through a slow network, it may not get faster, only the change date and file size. however, this speed is a certain degree of safety. please use it with caution. this option is activated in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similarly to the change date. there is no real comparison. the files are considered identical if it has lost big if when copying the change date is lost. please use caution. this option is activated in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activating the sync mode if two folders are compared to and no target folders. in this mode, the proposals will be identical, so that both folders are identical. also the results of merge files are stored in both folders. this option is shut down in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merge the copy of the newer file is proposed as the action. (this is the knowledge that the other file does not change also.) This option is posted in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or a file is replaced, then the original version is renamed or deleted the extension .origine. if an old backup file is already exists, this will be deleted without further backup. this also applies to the normal merge of single files, not only the merchanger file. this option is enabled in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folders merge view remains visible with the merge of individual files; you can switch the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want to switch the window and text window, main window will switch to the window menu and switch between the two views between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably, you prefer to compare a file just using double click. however, there is also a file menu in the menu. as soon as you need to save the folder, the status will be removed from the merge menu. as soon as you use the result, the status will be removed and the file will not be merged again when you merge the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status is lost however, if you have again read the directory: directory menu: new.</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. Kdiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way you can specify files and folders to open, which are located on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line resembles a local file with one FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. a few things should be aware of:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively unundy or.. included. that's not possible with URLs, these are always absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, spaces &gt;% 20, etc.), for example, a file named / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes, due to the server system on the server, sometimes by the protocol. it follows a short list of restrictions:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be classified as a link to a file or a folder. then, a file will always be accepted as a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no possibility to edit permissions or change of invoice. therefore, the permissions or change of change from the original. (please note the option) (This is only possible for local files).</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is currently being used as differences of viewer in KDevelop. KDevelop starts first ever to start the built-in differences, press the right mouse button on the differences viewer and then select In Kdiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally requires & diff3; two complete input files. if it is used as KPart, decreases & diff3; the name of the original files from the Patch-file. at least one of the two files must exist. then kicks off & diff3; the program patch can recover the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the queror you can select on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - Kdiff3Part. please note that it doesn't work if any of the original files exists. additionally, this is inreliable if the original files has changed since the creation of the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When using & diff3; as part is executed, it only supports the same from two files, a very small toolbar and menu. the merge or the equivalent of folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now it is Combat) there is already. furthermore, the name Kdiff3 already shows that it can merge as the program diff3 from the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs already very long and I have learned a lot in the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers which went on this road or so let him go so.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have previously compiled the program from the sources and the computer script will not install the right prefix to KDE. in the default, the resources can not be found in / usr / local, but then KDE can't find resources for the user interfaces (e.g., diff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information about this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters are different, these lines will be identical as identical; if only a non-white characters is different, the line is as not identical. if the Lines Lines is next to Each Other, this is is coined but this is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notice for each difference in the files where it begins and where it ends. this important information is lost, however, if the result is simply stored as text file and it's too much effort to create an extra file format that could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this has been too large. you can always recover a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger quantities of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing the text is suddenly lt; no src linens; published and the text can't delete. what does that mean and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& diff3; uses already many colors for raising differences. even more highlighting would be confusing and missing the purpose. please use a different editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">In order to use all functions of & diff3; you will need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">You can find information about how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE you can find on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of recent changes can be found in http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / Changelog or in the file Changelog in the Quell package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install diff3; on a system with & kde; use the following command in the base folder of & diff3; distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir gives the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsafe, you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & diff3; autoconf and automake use, you should not have any problems with compiling. should not occur trouble, please report on the & kde; -mailinglists of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift-Remove) into the clipboard and deletes the selected text. add (Ctrl V or Shift insertion) add text from the clipboard to the current cursor position and replaces the current mark.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences: files that are identical in all folders are not appear in the folder, and therefore not in target folders.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you need to re-read the folder with the function updates to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">Only entries are displayed, the differences are displayed. if the target folder will not already be copied to the target folders. if the target folder these files are not already modified, they are missing after the merge. (the behaviour is probably modified in a later program version.) This option is switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to choose from the source with the labelling A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines are attached to the end of the selected group at the end of the selected group (if they are not already present), if the lines are already present, they will be removed from clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">The default option is deactivated this option. underscores in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & kpager; shows a minifigure of all virtual work surfaces. it is quite practical to change their size on the working area to change their size or move them. this works both within a desktop and also at several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & kpager; can view all virtual work surfaces as well as in current applications. the applications can be selected and can be moved to the desktop and to another.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the central mouse button, windows can be moved within & kpager; the movement is possible both within a desktop and other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on it, where the right mouse button is clicked on the empty background of & kpager; if the context menu will only be clicked on the application and the name of the application as well as the entries must be minimize, maximize, On Desktop and Finish.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window on the full size of mind. appears only if you click on a application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. appears only if you click on a application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this box is marked, window can be moved within the & cpager; it can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, will be displayed in & kpager; the name of virtual work surfaces are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Cross this field you can display the & kpager; the numbers of virtual work surfaces. it is crossed along with the name, the names will be ordained, and eg; 1. mind.</seg>
<seg id="2459">When this field is crossed, the background of each desk is also displayed as background in & kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is crossed, the current programs will be displayed as small window in & kpager; otherwise, only the empty working area will be displayed to enable their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows a small view of actual program interface. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & kpager can be used: classic leaves & kpager; available in a 2xn grid; horizontally, all virtual work surfaces in a horizontal position and vertically in a vertical row, which is very good for the presentation on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager miniprogram in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size that can display windows as symbols or with their contents, and is also running outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Click the right mouse button within & kpager; and the following selector switch can be set up... can be released to the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently, this can't be changed in the dialog for Settings. but you can manually fill it manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vie. if you have no write permission for the file, you need to register as user root or login to your system administrator. in this file, you have to set the key windowTransparency mode and to this one value. possible values are:</seg>

<seg id="2482">If you are able to start a window as pictured above. the main window of & kmag is described above. in the following this window is described as a magnification window. the image that is displayed in the magnification window is an enlarged range of screen and is described in the following as a selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the default setting, it can be increased & can; the area around the mouse pointer like a mobile microscope. alternatively, you can choose a selected screen area in the magnification window (selection mode) or the environment of the mouse pointer at the edge (eg; on the left screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid the mouse pointer in the enlarged window, select the mouse pointer. please note that & kmag is not able to recognise the form of the mouse pointer. this is always the standard kde; / Qt; -mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the selection mode you can customize the selection window to your needs. you can change it with the arrow keys and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse pointer in the magnification window and hold the left mouse button, so you can catch the contents of the magnification screw and postpone. this also works with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you additionally fix the & Shift; press the & MMB, you can move the select window.</seg>

<seg id="2504">If Intelligentler is switched on, the shooting time is switched on (1 / 10 s). here the time is set, the & kmousetool will wait, before the mouse button is waiting, when the mouse button starts again, if there is no evidence for the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool is now enabled by clicking a slow motion. this function is enabled, followed by a break, a click with right mouse button. a slow motion to the right and back leads a double click. these movements are stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt for the first time, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can reduce the response time. open the & kcontrolcenter; go to sound & multimedia, select there sound system and here the rider. there is a slide-buffer sound buffer that you can reduce response times to reduce response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is marked, & kmousetool is started. at any start of & kde; this function is currently only under & kde; available at GNOME or other window environments please take the relevant documentation to figure out how you start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Put all settings on the values, which were set when opening the dialog box. have already pressed the button instructions, the settings will be reset to the last pressing of user.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first use presets with the default settings. in particular, intelligent move should first be switched off. if you click on automatic mouse click the smart move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; by sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of what places a mouse click without effect: clicking on neutral components of windows or on positions in Browserwindow that do not lead to unintentionally reactions. you can use the mouse to use such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse printer, you should clean your mouse. this is usually pretty easy. the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball, but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you need to remove the mouse ball. as it happens, is different from mouse to mouse, but it should be quickly clear if you watch the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used. the dirt and the pollution can be easily crushed with a flat blade or the fingernagel.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system breaks down by & kmousetool; if you're using the intelligent move in this case, it means that & kmousetool means that the surgery can no longer be able to finish the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use under another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click here. this is the status of & kmousetool; reset and you can work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mousetool; continue to run the cursor into another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: do you use the mouse to place the cursor there. but if you don't use the mouse on a neutral area of mind, if you are using a keyboard player. so a safe zones for the mouse pointer & eg; the grey areas for the mouse hand are & eg; the grey areas around the toolbars and the frontlines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I'm trying to work with the intelligent move, but I do not create it to edit the text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Intelligent move is a advanced function of & kmousetool; and it needs its time before you want to handle it into the clipboard or want to insert it into the clipboard or to insert any other action, if you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. however, there will probably be some problems. here are some advice here:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Use the intelligent move not just when you just start & kmousetool instead. select text instead of the text and hold the switch-button pressed while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and again the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Do you use the audible mouse click here. in this way, when & kmousetool will use a sound like a mouse click. so you can use the intelligent move time without the audible mouse click here. but later you need to use some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">In order to use & kmousetool; use the XTest extension for & X Window; installed. this should be the case most of the system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse click is only available when the system has a sound card and speaker and this is correct.</seg>

<seg id="2622">In order to understand the working mode of filters it is important to know how the program "page dispatcher" works with a text. & ktts; differs four kinds of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of Screen reins has the highest priority. it will be drawn to all other orders and will hold these orders. if the output of the screen Reader is read, the orders will be continued again.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important News such as & eg; processor is too hot. a warning has precedence and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders will be resumed after the release of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the next priority priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example for an application that lets you use & kmouth; someone welcome you to enter the room. & kde; alerts are also news. read here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text applications. each mission is a text order. KSayit is a text order. KSayit is an example of applications that have been used in text applications. text orders are intended for the output longer texts that have no particular drums.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in maintenance-long, with the exception of the output of Screen readers. if an application reads the output of a screen-reader, while & ktts; just a such presreads, this edition will hold and finished.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Readers. they will be applied to normal warnings, messages and text applications as well as on & kde; -News.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter edit the text and give it to the next filter. at present there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are available as modules. in the future, there may be more types of filters in the future.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and propositional impregnation filters (SDB filters). SBDs can start up text in individual propositions. as only the first set is synthesized, not all the text order. thus, you can also keep track or withdraw or break or break, even if the synthesizer does not support them directly.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you can see the sata limitance filters. at the first start of & ktts, it is set automatically set up a propositional imaging filter. you can modify the settings or add additional sentence detection filters, but is not recommended.</seg>

<seg id="2731">You can get assignments on board ticket orders or can not break even if the synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons the normal set-border filters are automatically set up when you can start ktops on the first time. it can't be removed only. do not change anything to this filter, unless you know what you do.</seg>
<seg id="2733">With a regular expression for Satissing and add a tabulatory sign (Decimal code 8) to the proposition limit (tab signs are removed from the text). please note that the standard proposition zone filter does not retain the character encoding.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; -News (kle), warnings, news, or the output of Screen refunds.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed from the normal set limit filter, you can retrieve it again by using the standard _ sbdrc file.</seg>

<seg id="2834">The installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is simply downloading the rpm package and can be downloaded in one & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool with graphical user can be used as a package or the installation tool of its distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & kde; not, but additionally the development plan will be required with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & networkconf; use the following commands to compile this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information on basic network technology will be discussed in the second, all by & knetworkconf; changing configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area can not replace further knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix only basic information on the integration of the PC in a small (home -) network conveys.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently, IP networks are operated with TCP / IP Version 4 (IPv4). IPv4 has never found large spread. from IPv6 it is expected to continue in the near future. this description is therefore focused on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the main information is the knowledge to assign IP address of a network interface. in strange networks, on & eg; workplace is the network administrator that will be able to address a valid IP address. in any case, the IP address can not be chosen as desired!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When creating a private small (home) network, the IP address should be selected specifically for this purpose to avoid IP address data. the addresses from the table below are not redirected on the Internet, hence its use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines are possible through setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, most addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 is used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the net mask usually is set to 255.255.255.0, so that all computer participants are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = the own computer). the default route is required for the IP address.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in local own machine. normally, the address is assigned to 127.0.0.1 of its own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part there are the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf; and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes changed to DSL connections, so that it is not surprising when in case of active DSL connections, another content is defined there.</seg>

<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be bound by & dat; this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& dat; go back to the band and reads the pre-span of the band. recognise & dat; the provocation on the band will not be asked if the tape should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognise & dat; the ban on your table, if it is not found, you will be asked if the band index will be reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Everything has gone smoothly, changing the symbol for the tape drive to show that the band is bound. in the status bar a corresponding message appears. the volume of the belt can now be searched for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before the disclosure of the bander, first the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& dat; can be seen by a change of symbol for the band that the integration for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the band can now be rejected without risk.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a volume of & dat; used, it must be formatted by & dat; formatted.</seg>

<seg id="2902">After entering the band named and the capacity goes & dat; with the formatting of the band. all data on the band will be lost automatically! after completion of the formatting process the band is automatically bound and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the backup process, you must select the files that can be secured. it can be done on three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in local file size. only this file or folder is secured.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a safety profile in the tree. only the files are secured in the profile.</seg>

<seg id="2921">Sometimes it refers to be necessary to create the Bandindexfile using the band content. this procedure deletes all existing index files for this volume. you can create the index on two types of the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This is a secure profile with just selected files and default settings. you can make the following settings for a secure profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current subfolder where the backup is to be done. the list of the files will be updated automatically according to the chosen work folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders that are under backup files are valid that only the files are secured that are located on the same file system, like the folder. folders that are on other file systems, you can register separately under the backup files. each entry is considered tar independent of the other.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have been changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is secured that since then they have changed since.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before calling from tar. this causes all files to be secured and created a new snapshot file for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons are gt; and lt; lt; files was not fully implemented at the time of creation this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can be set via the menu option KDat... in the menu settings. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device works for the tape drive (normally / dev / tape). this path has to be transferred to the non-rewinding version of the belt device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">This setting is active, transmitted & dat; before the tape is bound to the drive. in some disk drives this is necessary, before read or write operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is switched on, tries & dat; to lock the capture of tape drive. possibly, this setting does not work with all band drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is enabled, the bond will be subjected to the integration of & dat; automatically cast out the tape. do not use this option on floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, tries & dat; not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you need & dat; in any case the block size for your tape drives are added.</seg>
<seg id="2935">When & dat; a band is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the band. this file should only contain one memory block on the band. the file data sets itself as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n byte) The Band-ID. the format of this string is hosts: seconds, with hostname the full name of the system is formatted on which the band has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that has been formatted since the epoch in which the band has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the band are pure tar -Archive which can manage directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work, as long as it is not an incremental backups.</seg>

<seg id="2940">& ksachlog; is a & kde; viewing for system protocols. the program is available for inexperienced users, where you can get information on your system, or where the system allows users to access the system via your system, allowing users to access information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& Editor log; helps users to understand what your computer is making in the background. the program is suitable for inexperienced users, which can't know where you can get information about your system or where the system is deposited into the various protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Furthermore, & Editor log; experienced users access the fast access to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksellers log; therefore, a few advanced functions have been trying to be filtered and evaluated by using the protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 contains & ksellers log; a number of useful features include amongst others:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other features are also included in addition, and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot, & ksellers log; functions can easily be filtering and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file easily and sort them. the individual possibilities for sorting and filters are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After launching & ksellers log; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol, you will not appear, and it will not open a small message window, so you will not see with system administrator right. the protocol files are normally under Linux normally in the folder / var / log, for the normal user does not have any permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter out according to a limited range of criterion or according to the filter bar. in the default setting, select a log line next to the filter. then, a protocol line will only be displayed if in one of the columns, the filter search is included.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry in this location. the drawing of the filter search term is then used only with entries in the protocol file system. select the process of a process as shown in the filter bar the name of a process, so show you & ksellers log; all protocol lines sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in default settings and helps you to recognise the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level error are displayed with a striking colour as protocol lines of level note. the color representation of protocol lines can be switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Would you like to display specific process (for example, in the system protocol or in cron protocol), you can then be useful if you want to examine the output identification (PID) if you want to examine the output of a certain command as for example to the start of the Samba server. in this case you will use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Furthermore, you can jump to the new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksellers log; enables you to open multiple protocol files into separate sub-windows. to open this function, use the entries in the menu window to open additional signatures. once you have selected a window, select a protocol to display.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& kseway log; has a dedicated website to http: / / kssystem log.forum-software.org. Dort you will find further current information about the source of & ksachlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& kslog log, you will also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archives: kssystem log; in & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; this section leads some concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V Init has quickly evolved into the standard for control of the system start at the system in the & Linux; world. therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I'm not going to go on historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is below / sist and not under / etc. this is therefore important because someone might try to implement a machine on system V init without a new installation and new format. that's why you will need to make sure the old Init was removed from there, if there was one there.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SYSV Init differs from BSD Init, that the configuration files in a subfolder / etc are instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you find rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole amount scripts. basically, you require a script for each system service, which you want to start at the high-level system. system services include such things such as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc. system services include such things such as setserial serial that will only be started. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should lie down under / etc / rc.d if you require it. most of the systems have this file, even if it does not have much use for this. you can also use a rc.serial / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is looking for different places after the program init and starts the first to take it.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard runlevel is in / etc / inittab. in the initial area you should see line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look into the second column and probably determine that the default, you can change / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you can change anything, then you'll fix it by using the system and run the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start to enter all the right scripts? if you enter -l in rc3.d, then you will probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How starts and stops init? very simple: each of scripts is so written that there is an argument like start and stop. you can actually start this scripts actually from hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would keep the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the K comprises, the script will be called with the argument. if it includes a S, the script will start with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people desire a simple way to set machines for many purposes. I might have httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. in addition, I could also have a user Runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was so user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is simple to say not to say: simply drag an entry from the area of availability to one of the six rounds to start it at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also change scripts, or change the position within a level by changing it. thereby, the entry is removed from its original runlevel (or its position). this happens only if they will extract a entry in the area of availability.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries will be postponed if you want to copy this into a new runlevel, you need to select copy from the menu click here or from the context menu -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target range of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes be calculated sometimes. in such a case you have to process the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there is no possibility to restore entries that were thrown into the trash trash. be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab button to activate the different working areas (availability, runlevel 1 stop, runlevel 1 stop & etc.) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection of top or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move one entry into another round level, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the input button to switch between different fields. connect the tab button to accept the changes in order to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are taken in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. preferences will be taken from & ksysv. otherwise they will be reproduced by & ksysv. changes to the default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have to experiment with the standard Runleveling, and now the machine is restructured. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single use mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default level to a reasonable value (3 should normally be OK).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; available at runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD) you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only present in these distributions. please read more details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The type, such as system services are started in these distributions, but unfortunately no standard simplifies for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using another distribution: please check if all configuration files are needed (and even if they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) are simply without message if your configuration files are not available or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, may even be different from version to version differently. if you use a different distribution, please send me information about the runlevel, so that this manual can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & user; it is sufficient to read Chapter adjustment of & kuser; read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After having made changes you have to save it. either use the corresponding symbol of the toolbar or the entry saving in the menu file.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two cartridge card, user and user groups. for processing, choose the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry. it appears the dialog's user or group characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some cartridge card will only be displayed if you have extended system settings. only if you can specify a card card, if you can change individual settings, if shadow -passwords or e.g. / etc / master pass.passwd may be installed as in BSD-Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card information is released, if shadow passwords or e.g. / etc / master.passwd is installed as in BSD -Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card appears only if for at least a embedded file system of limitation (Quota) is activated and initialized (visible on the file rates quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here, for every user parameters, the limited restrictions in KB are:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current file system is selected using the field of filesystem with space limit</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card groups informs about the groups of the selected user. the standard group, to which the user is heard, you will find in the field of Primary Group. furthermore, the user can be a member in other groups by selecting this in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog characteristics of the Group contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select adding from the menu or group or click on the matching add button of the toolbar. the processing or deleting of the selected user or the selected group works analogue.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO boot manager, remove the boot order, remove and change the time to boot of the standard operating system, remove the standard operating system, add, modify, change operating systems, change and more.</seg>
