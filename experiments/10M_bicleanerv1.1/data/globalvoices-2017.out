although I visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year I would live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love to America is exceptionally great .
as many of my generation I grew up with American movies , I had read about American music , American authors read and use his sport .
in fact , this country had a good pro@@ found effect on me that I was mainly due to an American film journalist .
when 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the grand D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a terrible repor@@ ter , who covered the mur@@ der@@ ous con@@ spi@@ racy of a oil painting , which were inclined to his interest .
I was caught .
free according to Method Man , &quot; I was it , as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else I would like to do with my life . &quot;
and the year that I lived in Arizona , my ad@@ mir@@ ation for the USA had only been reinforced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I always said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; America is the only country where I ever lived in whom I ever lived so welcoming that you are always who you are and it is easily acqu@@ is@@ ance in a community of equal people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had even written a very low heat cover about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
a lot was written about the tourism and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of its asc@@ ension is to me as he goes with his eng@@ th@@ iness .
he never stops in his opinion behind the mountain , as it says so beautiful .
he says exactly what he does , like a former colleague it , and explains his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Latin@@ os , Af@@ ro@@ amer@@ ican and women .
nevertheless , people responded to his statements and approved in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes , who won in the republi@@ can elections , was the highest number formed by the party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans , who support these big@@ u@@ ary person , I asked me ?
I could not have Tr@@ ump and his voters not with people in harmony I learned during my time in Phoenix .
as for example , my Professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , people from all over the world , a low glorious human being able to talk about Islam and its past .
also , Tr@@ um@@ ps also voted by Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the &quot; Cinc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er , &quot; agree .
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours therefore , the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tr@@ um@@ ps int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity that I fought with Sandy B@@ ahr , who fought their life for the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family who was treated me like their son .
she is still suitable for the commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who helped me with a lot of patience and grace , and helped us to get to the complexity of the American life .
then Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise counsel has helped me much with my career .
these people and those caused by them reduce my love to America .
while Tr@@ ump hel@@ med his way to the nominal Republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered a stop and the counter@@ part in its limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presi@@ dency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the con@@ front@@ ation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they dealt either his rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ ism , because they were ready to over@@ see these things , broke me almost the heart .
perhaps it is un@@ fair to draw the Tr@@ ump elec@@ tor as R@@ assi@@ sts .
the people rep@@ lied , said one of my friends , is exactly what has led us to this situation .
this is su@@ perf@@ ici@@ ally and resp@@ ect@@ less and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows the people that their wor@@ ries and fears of h@@ ec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that this voters , of which most white have been tuned for Tr@@ ump , because they would like to win the control of a country , which she has disappointed ?
in other words , they would perhaps say that they are still important in this America ?
perhaps .
however one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ n@@ ick , who wrote the cruel decision to raise a man who looks back on those with regard to those that look differently than he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ jection of the White against all other Eth@@ ni@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; voc@@ abul@@ ary from white in An@@ play on the White and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means that the great Van Jones called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did exactly what America did so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world estimate the American Ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background you may always have , America is welcome every welcome .
for this country , as his pre@@ sidents , elected twice the son of a Ken@@ ian@@ ers , whose history how he himself says , no@@ where else in the world would be possible .
with the election Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is a huge part of white America &apos;s promise and says : to Hell with multi@@ th@@ iness , freedom of freedom and all term of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America , after 9 / 11 , the white man is again at the Ru@@ der , they say .
in all that I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier , who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
at a rally for Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
the crowd answered with a loud voice &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; were Muslims a place in your Americas ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; brood the quantity .
&quot; did Latin@@ os have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered them .
do A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your Americas ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they called them and their voices were loud .
&quot; would someone who doesn &apos;t know how to take a place in your Americas ? &quot;
he received a one and loud &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
Mr. Khan ended with the words : &quot; God is thanks to Mr. Tr@@ ump , is that not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land , for which his son had fallen , sent him a message .
that is now Tr@@ um@@ ps Land , said the message .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find no space in this new Americas .
and that breaks me my heart .

what has the Mexican musical school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero municipality in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ische City Cat@@ e@@ ura together ?
that the music , which is played on both sites , does not only change the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music , who lives with the waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large gar@@ bage dump , only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists , but worlds away from the nearby pre@@ Colom@@ bian ruins and its world famous cuisine .
for some years now , La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( musical ban@@ de ) has been playing in the municipality : one out of children and adults , existing symph@@ ony orchestra , which has found their musical instruments a possibility to over@@ coming the surrounding poverty .
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the parish of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in Oaxaca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality , which is located in one of the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces Mexico , is known for their drugs abuse and the banking violence .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilots in which a musical project started and the youth had a rare hope .
the young band members take their obligations towards the music group , the local press not@@ ici@@ as Oaxaca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to meet their great passion .
they come always laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play in the Tru@@ bel you are learning day for tag trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ bre@@ l , Bon@@ g@@ os and the Con@@ ga .
music from rub@@ b@@ ish
more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village , which is practically above the largest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ on in Paraguay , on instruments which are made of recycled waste material :
music with prepared instruments made of local firm waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura where the recycling of F@@ avi@@ o Chávez started to turn parts of the query into instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ate , viola , c@@ elli , double b@@ asses , gu@@ itars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trumpets , tromb@@ ones and percussion , which were all manufactured from the gar@@ bage .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music and music of the Beatles , from Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Chávez reminds a local econom@@ ist and musical instructor of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , at the initial time :
first , it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ sal when the parents worked in the gar@@ bage . the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents , because many of them do not live with their children .
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something that he had never seen before : one out of the waste was made from waste .
today , there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments made of recycled material , and is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentary &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) shows the musical performance on :
the world generates about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish every year .
those who live with him and of him are the p@@ oo@@ rest - as people in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspir@@ ing scene from gar@@ bage to music around the world .
the orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis :
these Eastern African countries show how technology and team@@ work successfully combat the illegal fishing industry
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that f@@ ights against the wild f@@ isheries .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published by En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that has been designed specifically for international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ release occurs within the framework of an agreement with global Vo@@ ices for the common use of Content Vo@@ ices .
in West Africa there was then known that this ship had already operated illegal catch of illegal catch @-@ fishing before the other coast of Africa .
the Eastern African countries were scattered over this way , and a little cause to welcome a bill of law to its coasts on their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the com@@ ors , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seych@@ elles mobil@@ ized quickly against the ship . they refused to share one of their har@@ bours and refused to divide it to him as a fishing table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Prime Minister is surrounded by countries that you simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ il@@ u , an executive employee of the ken@@ ian fishing authority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is part of a team that discovered the ship once more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was sold out of the waters of the region : it wasn &apos;t able to catch fish there .
finally it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars on Liberia , due to pill@@ aging the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which protects criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO stop illegal F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal fisher@@ y ) .
the members of this network are alongside Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries that were exp@@ elled from their waters at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have eight countries that are involved and work together . they exchange information from and stand on each side where it is illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts Project En@@ ding . this project provides technical support .
illegal fishing is regulated by definition : what is captured , is hidden since it is extremely difficult to occur . thus , Il@@ legal f@@ isheries is a main cause of over@@ fishing regions .
by deliber@@ ate cont@@ emp@@ t of existing laws , by means of certain hab@@ itats and species , Il@@ legal f@@ isheries ecos@@ ystems may harm a del@@ ic@@ ate balance .
but while actions against illegal f@@ isheries were once experienced by bureau@@ cr@@ atic hur@@ d@@ les , with information between individual countries , so these actions are in real time , with tra@@ ce@@ able on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
for example , the individual countries may exchange for example now exchange licenses , news about suspected activities or details that can be noticed during a port spectrum .
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very atten@@ tive when they move on the open lake , using satellite data .
this allows to mark the authorities to mark Shi@@ ps , which are fishing in banned areas - such as suspected driving conditions - such that the ship invites its caught fish on the way to other ships .
in ide@@ als , such studies can show whether the ships have a fishing licence , where they were on the road and possibly even if they have a criminal case .
countries that are against illegal fishing , can refuse to accept such ships in their har@@ bours . what means that the ships can &apos;t sell their charge . and that they could even be forced to pay for the numbers of pen@@ alties , as in the case of the Premier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about significant financial losses for the owners , which means that the illegal catch is fin@@ anci@@ ally worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and this is what we want to reach , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , executive director of NF@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant , which also supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to gain an estimated 20 million USD in lost sales , which will lose eight members of the Swiss network H@@ ISH @-@ i each year due to illegal fishermen that enter into East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fishing industry , which is due to the region &apos;s commercial fishing @-@ cat@@ cher from all over the world . among these , illeg@@ itim@@ ate fishermen .
these practices include actions like the sail under false flag , f@@ ake license papers , indication of phant@@ as@@ ien@@ names , the fish protected species and fish in nature areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they do not use the lack of international cooperation and make the weak@@ nesses of an un@@ paved control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , a ship was illegal and a country could say &apos; You will not run my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; and exactly this leg@@ ac@@ up@@ un@@ chy tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now .
so far the closed front work .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of susp@@ ects .
it has a criminal networks uncovered , which had counter@@ f@@ ake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships who used several dec@@ eit@@ ful ident@@ ities and has been persecuted and found .
due to its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international agency for com@@ b@@ ating crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances and preserved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our research shows us quite far in the co @-@ organizing crime &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system that should help F@@ ISH @-@ i , susp@@ ects ships of precise .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system which will always be further developed , also helps to hide the illegal ships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to conce@@ al their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Head analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at Tra@@ cking , a N@@ RO which also deals with fishing data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships turn off for example their automatic identification systems where they cannot be used by satellite .
in addition , Cop@@ eland helps to build a system which combines various information levels . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i help to find crimin@@ ating ships with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team African countries really affect the und@@ ou@@ bt@@ edly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth recently opened the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch &apos;s platform Global F@@ ishing Watch : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by the position of each tra@@ ce@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; gather together with the neigh@@ bors to get a better image of what does it - that &apos;s just sense &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to un@@ ite and to combine their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should do this at a global level . &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ ger Tru@@ sts will run a similar project , with which a global system sc@@ oring the persecution of ships .
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only crimin@@ als , but they are also scre@@ ams .
ships that were previously explo@@ ited without license and hardly to calculate with consequences , they now know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i participated in a 33 % increase in f@@ isheries sales since then boats can buy more licenses .
having helped F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia , Gre@@ ko 1 found the insp@@ ectors there on board locks , whose use is prohibited .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
other countries notice these successes . &quot; the effect is so strong that us now have to copy other countries , &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; we have become an study project . &quot; in Western Africa , several hundred million dollars are due to illegal fishing .
there are six countries closed in 2015 , for the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . also they fight illegal fishing , after exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; with safety , the aim is to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s most recent member country took his first major triumph : in October , it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship which was under false flag . and not only the ship was used without a license and were not allowed to have been banned .
the ship was still shown in forbidden waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the removal of dimensional rules toward Gre@@ ko 1 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had a strong sign that they proceed against illegal catch of fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time evidence that such a special , collab@@ orative work in the entire world also works . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . there she writes on the subject of the environment , technology and nutrition .

the road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of severe demonstrations .
they are considered protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on the Office of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the recovery of Venezuela ) can be found in both these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate will also be led in other parts of the country - among others in the flat area Bar@@ inas , in the Andes @-@ regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , centrally located at the central north of Nu@@ eva E@@ part@@ a .
the country &apos;s political and economic situation wor@@ sen@@ ed continuously , which makes herself a lack of food and medicines in the everyday life of Ven@@ z@@ ol@@ ans .
many representatives of the opposition saw in the official reference of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , the chance for a fundamental change ; but ultimately , however , the re@@ aring of a new election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises the context of the government statement as follows :
within the context of the social , political and economic crisis , the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % of the annual financial statements and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine , the referendum for many as the only way to give the country to restore its institutional structures and a new government alliance .

on Twitter frequent images that tell of conflict , as well as reports of repression and abuse .
especially large waves beat the news about police repression in the centrally located town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the protest@@ ers moved to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement before the police and armed advoc@@ ate of the government .
later they were able to leave the cathedral back in hours , but the protests went further .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ den@@ state T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira have no tube because one could see anything else could not have a lot of national@@ ities !
meanwhile , an inf@@ ographic shows the round , which forms the magnitude of repression per day :
so the dictatorship caused the country to op@@ press .
many representatives of the government had asked the validity of the demand for a official procedure - this has been demonstrated in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the road .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs :

here is your official release !

other values of this protests as further step in the fight against a government that made a little bit against the devastating economic crisis , and would prefer to leave critical voices to critical voices :
they have taken us so much - but also fear !
the mar@@ ches always take more frequency and intensity .

this is an adapted version of an interview of Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano , which was finally published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argentine news page .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano was forced to visit the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentine town of Cordoba .
as an adult man , Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano said in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ribera process in the province of Cordoba against his father .
in the process which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes investig@@ ates that were committed during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano doesn &apos;t have chosen his life .
starting with the brush , same name as his father to carry up to the brutal military operations in the La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , has suffered enough .
he held the family secret for 34 years .
in the situation then I believed that which was fine .
I felt like a secret mag@@ ent .
as a child with 15 years you don &apos;t notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
I could not know that my father was a thief , subsequent and rob@@ bers .
Luis had no election : his father Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ eri@@ dian . during the Argentine military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 in prison La Per@@ la .

this is not the story of Luis Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pressed , who was accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in nearly 100 cases and the ab@@ duction of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qu@@ i@@ j@@ anos son , a man who knew the extent of the atro@@ cities , which he had experienced in the years before a Federal Court against his own father .
his story shows that great power has a parent over his child , and how this child has chosen for himself a way of redemption .
from the Sports Hall to the Military base
when my father started to take me at the military base , I often went up with us in the sports hall . there I was rounded up with a boy , the mar@@ tial arts .
all known him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and called me to identify my boy@@ friend .
he said :
you are an ar@@ hole , you are rounded to you by one of the ERP .
pass only that they would not lead you out of one day , and I will save you .
the ab@@ brevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Li@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolution@@ aries of the revolution@@ aries of Argentina .
therefore he for@@ b@@ ade me to go back to the Sports Hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he said to me , I would like to be sal@@ es@@ mag@@ ent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for so my father had pulled me .
in the military base I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : University conclu@@ des , handwritten notes , literature , certificates , prop@@ aganda materials , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ da@@ h the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me four times after La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
during the first time and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time he commanded me to get out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - simply all possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a little more wrapped pop@@ es and ordered to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big cl@@ ums@@ y silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ rack where the stolen objects had been completed and signed me with a guard .
suddenly he interpreted to an open space and said :
there the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I sp@@ aw@@ ed , and saw a couch , tor@@ tured on humans .
it looked like a field @-@ bed and metal springs .
later I found out that it fortified the end of a cable . the other end was fast@@ ened by the body of the person who was just fast@@ ened there .
they held a man with hand sh@@ ank on the bed , over@@ thrown him with water and hunt him a charge of 220 volts to the gen@@ it@@ alia .

the rock there was horri@@ ble there ... like a dirty Win@@ del .
years later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same od@@ our came out of his room .
I realized the smell immediately and it was clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I never forget this smell .
and I asked : how is it only possible that a man can do so much harm ?
&apos;@@ I knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me for the third time to work , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were g@@ ged with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and carried out ey@@ eb@@ rows .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; L@@ op@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z , a civilians who also was indicted in the process ) and I used the opportunity to throw a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a series of matt@@ resses , on which naked people with the face down below - all were mounted on hands and feet .
close to the entrance , people rested on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoner , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why do you look like what happened ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me out ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried .
I know that because my father told me at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero beat there a man there and killed .
according to the survi@@ vor@@ s of survi@@ vor@@ s , Jorge Rom@@ ero is also indicted for the students of Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Molina to death in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ribera process .
in the following video , Emilio F@@ essi@@ a , the head of the Memorial La Per@@ la , leads through the former Fol@@ ter@@ ian chambers .
the track , which you came in here , is also the way that we arrived here .
when you look at the map , see that they took about this way and then tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they got to be assigned a number as part of the trial of the de@@ duction .
when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order of above came that they should be moved .
this was the lie - the Eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War yield &apos;
my father brought all kinds stolen things with home .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; war yield &quot; - as they called it .
but when I was later in the military , I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear that war yield is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military service , which one has fought against an enemy .

but if you go into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ tables , clothing , painting , money ... sti@@ p@@ ated , then it is not a war yield but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I always asked me as my father , the leader of the security forces in which V@@ and@@ alism was able to do .
I don &apos;t understand it .
I was also officer of the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I wouldn &apos;t like to enter into a house and steal everything about it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do this .
once he called me a crime and I answered : and you , seeing the car on the street ?
you are not a crime ?
he explo@@ ded against rage , struck me and cried :
if you go so far , then I will find you and w@@ rest@@ art@@ ed you .
so we do not need any other !
so my father was .
I have no one good reminder to him .
when I said in the process I showed a photo from then , on which I had a jacket and a roll swe@@ ater of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he nevertheless brought clothes with home .
at that time , the defense accused me to have been a fellow country with this crime . I said , no problem , they can put me to load what they wanted .
I was anyway there to say so .
&apos; the dis@@ appearance of the dead is the last ab@@ h@@ or act &apos;
now , where I am older , I am curious .
I have children . if one has only children , you can recognize the value of a life .
it is further developed and recogni@@ zes that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you did so , in the dictatorship of the dictatorship , but what the cor@@ p@@ ses come disappear ?
why children de@@ duce ?
one day my father brought a girl with home , whose mother was killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - that this was a little girl .
I always turned the question again : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could simply take it into prison .
I guess it was just decided to kill these people . but what their bodies will disappear ?
had those people unable to commit their mort@@ al remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the dead is the last ab@@ h@@ or act that one can do a man .
my father told me when the democracy was re @-@ introduced , they brought to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners .
they were cr@@ ushed and somewhere . no idea , where . &quot; one will never find something , &quot; said my father .
but anything remains of course .
&apos; I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I even was even at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said just the truth about 20 Cri@@ me - including my father .
the thought to indicate my father was created during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I did him to see him because of all the atro@@ cities that I had to suffer for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have been killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt wor@@ ried and asked me , for what the whole bu@@ oy@@ ant patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they allegedly def@@ ended , actually was good .
then I cried out :
how can you tell me what to say ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed a terrible crime , and you have forced me to participate in a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , let me show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
exactly what did I do .
in 2010 I was charged the first display .
I finally knew that he was a bur@@ gl@@ ar .
no one can imagine that I am vo@@ des@@ ingen@@ ious . I finally told my own father .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest still standing before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 416 offen@@ ders : among them heavier and non @-@ legal freedom of torture in 158 cases , murder in 98 cases , torture with subsequent deaths in five cases and a case of ab@@ duction of one under 10 years of child .

after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ribera process ended with crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August 1975 and December 1978 .
43 Supp@@ lied , for crimes against humanity , found guilty of crimes against humanity and sentenced to 28 years imprisonment in 28 cases . in six cases , charges were handed over between 2 and 14 years .

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto for &quot; terrible drivers &quot;
the sign with the transmission error at a center in K@@ YO@@ TO , where one can leng@@ then his driver &apos;s license .
the picture was widespread in social media .
machining of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese town of Kyoto , customers were able to extend a newly opened centre in which one can leng@@ then his driver &apos;s witnesses in the last month , in particular .
on a sign the Japanese word of the ( ko@@ rei@@ fen@@ sh@@ a ) , which means &quot; older drivers &quot; means , but perhaps also with b@@ lot back@@ grounds &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; fe@@ ar@@ able motor@@ ists &quot; transl@@ ates .
the false translation was dated from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the input range and in the building itself .
machining of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , divided into social media .
the error was the translator Julian Holmes , a residents of Ky@@ ot@@ os , who did it attention to the local newspapers .
the daily Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n is written in Kyoto :
&quot; how could it come to an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
this is an ins@@ ult for older people and in an international city such as Kyoto simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; Holmes &quot; said .
the incorrect English translation was first removed at first . the name of the drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; terrible motor@@ ists &quot; ) was later replaced by the reasonable , if also gramm@@ atical is not the correct name &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; ( german : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the police of the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture claims for the translation errors . furthermore it declared that the error was already contained in the text that they had written by trans@@ lat@@ ors and that the translation was not checked on their correc@@ t@@ ness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry that older people were buried through the in@@ adequate correction ( translation ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News compiled a little more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; fe@@ ar@@ ful &quot; was refused as an un@@ reasonable description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents are involved , but definitely reason to worry .
in the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture for example , 1.@@ 9@@ 41 were caused by seniors in 2005 , which corresponds to a proportion of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , senior citizens filed 1.8@@ 03 of a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents .
this thus increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has fallen in total , the proportion of seniors caused by seniors in the same period has increased .
the nam@@ eless does not mentioned repor@@ ter in the writing version of the article comments on the light that show how some Japanese seems to be apparent against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo on the translation error received the following comments :
- &quot; Is it not the reality ? &quot;
- &quot; so does the translation isn &apos;t really bad , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that it is a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not many such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; spreads in the whole of Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true excav@@ ation for these bizar@@ re errors in English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of trans@@ lat@@ ors are mani@@ fold .
you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the output text and active language skills to transfer him to target language .
the latter requires the active rule of target language - something that is in the native language . generally , the convic@@ tion is that trans@@ lat@@ ors in the target language - do not be in native language - native language .
such a French native language to translate from English to French - not from the French into English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r users Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as the mother tongue that could be translated into English . this may be lack of understanding for the survi@@ ving , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English speakers that can learn Japanese .
some companies that have no foreign employees allow translations to have fir@@ ing internally . then the Japanese employees , whose English knowledge is considered the best , to trans@@ lat@@ ors - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really good .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r users Karl Baron .
machine translation are also widespread - often with funny results .
the pro@@ ver@@ ing and av@@ ailed phr@@ ases that are created by machine translation will show that this technology can still replace non @-@ human trans@@ lat@@ ors . this applies to some languages .
some of the stran@@ gely English formulation in Japan , including T @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for sty@@ li@@ ous reasons - not to be read or understood .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r users Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors like jewelry still acceptable or at least harm@@ less . but by major companies or by the government who have the means to guarantee higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
the city of Kyoto uses a serious source for their translations in the future .
Venezuela : take Prot@@ ests and C@@ ens@@ ur@@ ation in Internet and Television
&quot; &quot; &quot; main page of the portal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to PRE@@ N@@ SA y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ elan Internet users found that they have no access to the online station Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other user wrote that the internet appearances are available by V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV as well as no longer available .
other online transmitter also contributed the recordings of the protests in Caracas , which were organized by op@@ positi@@ onal groups , which the government of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros are re@@ arranged .
the protests began early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and transferred the tasks of the Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is chew@@ ed , and receive the name , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet .
# Zen@@ sur : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ elan provider is again closed .
this is from the site of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the dental vene@@ ers with internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been reported in the coverage of protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission threatened them for t@@ elecommunications with cash and lock@@ ers if they continue to report on demonstrations , as the Commission looked to &quot; call on violence . &quot;
without cable TV and inform@@ ational national TV channels I applied again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
aston@@ ishing that it is even cheaper than two litres of lem@@ on@@ ade to buy .
the local NGO VE@@ F@@ fil@@ let confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay through a pl@@ ung of the domain name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online broad@@ c@@ aster . this also applies to the National Assembly on the National Assembly .
earlier follow @-@ up of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had demonstrated that the local internet providers can sometimes use DNS . this is a technique that answer to the DNS server requests of certain domains .
when a web site is blocked by the DNS , the server will answer or refuse the request to call such a website .
we confirm a DNS c@@ re : @ el@@ ap@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ v@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third @-@ per@@ ched channel , the transmission was discontinued on Thursday April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera ann El@@ vis Flo@@ res , who survived the protests in Caracas , was arrested in prison .
Flo@@ res was sm@@ itten while he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on show .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government is regulated by the government : this is the Ven@@ z@@ ol@@ utions of access to multi media coverage of the current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls are too s@@ av@@ ed to receive a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child in Cri@@ ad@@ ita . now she visits her house where she worked for years .
today Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collec@@ ts witness of other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , which were exactly like the victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report from Kur@@ ds , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ elan , es@@ cu@@ ci@@ que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; F@@ aw cows , falling schools &quot; ) , edited by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America and re @-@ released .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household , where they did not eat together with the family that lived there .
just before her studies at the University , she returned to the house once again and heard how the owner of the house full of pride on them . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he that has become a little thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated as a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . when Cri@@ ad@@ itas known in Paraguay the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to school .
the shop is very simple : a great family with little money survived her min@@ der@@ son &apos;s son or her min@@ der daughter to another , rich family . in the thousands of the child &apos;s child food , a training and a roof over the head .
however , it is not mentioned that the children must aff@@ ord countless days of household goods that may never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that in the context of an agreement that cannot be raised .
this is widely used as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go practice in Paraguay with participation and acceptance by great parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations .
after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fought for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke to Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected witness , calculated and refused .
she tried to call things in name , because the feeling of grat@@ itude that is in@@ implic@@ ated to Cri@@ ad@@ itas guaranteed in general .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double t@@ ap@@ pointing , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
since then , on the other hand , the family , who had her daughter in faith , to improve their training in society and make something out of itself , &quot; another family can do . &quot;
on the other hand stands the family that tak@@ eth up the girl with the faith and its exploitation with faith , that they would be someone who would have no training , and maybe even was hungry .
the Sac@@ ri@@ fice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is har@@ assed , his family will only hear many years later .
sometimes they will never learn of it .
in January 2016 , this is relatively unknown phenomenon that takes place in the bor@@ ough in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín in Ca@@ ñ@@ az@@ ú came into hospital , her body showed signs of severe sl@@ ings . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former military group Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as an official representative at the registration office .
Mar@@ ín lived in their home in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira struck it as long as with a stick to Mar@@ ín until they suffered dead@@ ly injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported about the incident .
they made concrete that the first child was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
according to UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela , the deeply involved in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Society has been responsible for the death of the girl &apos;s death in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Society .
they described the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest documents and demanded that there will be no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , compl@@ aining Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without Pap@@ ers it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , among which conditions boys and girls live .
the neigh@@ bors of the sp@@ a@@ ars and nearly 60 civil society organisations requested a rapid examination of the case .
they want that Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo had been sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case of judgment comes , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín would be landmark - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is coming from court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
Cri@@ ad@@ itas is not only explo@@ ited as working forces , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ mers , in which her father worked , bank@@ rupt@@ cy had to sign up and her father lost his work .
their brothers had to go all work and started to sell money on the street or market swe@@ ets , to earn money .
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent when Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of their emplo@@ yers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
thereby they had to divide the time so that you still remained at the time to learn .
she spent every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for their employer .
on Fridays , they puri@@ fied the fridge , plast@@ ered the living room , polished the furniture and the infected floors .
when the school was at the end , she went home again and had time to learn .
the more time she had finished with learning , the more leisure had her .
but this time was limited , because they still had dinner for their employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she had to never hunger , but did not get an unlimited meal . &quot; I could get more books from the library of the house@@ holder as a food from the fridge , &quot; she remin@@ is@@ cent of them .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the owner , a former military and sympath@@ izers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 until 1989 .
at some evenings of the house@@ holder Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , next to him and comments from Opp@@ os@@ itory newspapers , such as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to convince them to convince the reports of the official media over the regime of the dict@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he kept her for intelligent , but didn &apos;t talk with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the house@@ holder had found someone who heard while he spoke about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says she . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they failed to visit my family , because they were the opinion that I heard there again &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor an@@ gu@@ esses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a belongs to the native group of Guar@@ an@@ í who would speak to home their native language gu@@ ar@@ í . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their Lord feared that they had the education that they had allowed to lose , declared it .
however , it was completely clear that she had paid for everything they had paid for them , with their hard work .
in school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was also discri@@ min@@ ated in school . &quot; a matter which is almost never spoken , mo@@ b@@ bing and the ch@@ ic@@ ans where cri@@ ad@@ itas are exposed to school .
because the other children parents have , they immediately know that someone has no parents , a cri@@ ad@@ ita .
I was unable to invite you to my home . I had no fre@@ des@@ kreis in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in time where friends arise , I felt very clear that I was not a group .
the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a explains .
the society Pro@@ pos@@ es the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a fac@@ ebook group , in which one can be used for cleaning agents and children &apos;s maid in Paraguay .
the administration fee of the group is Pep@@ a Kost@@ ian@@ ov@@ sky , a city council in the As@@ unci@@ on district .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little haz@@ ard for my little daughter , who plays in the morning and afternoon with her .
to learn .
please call you .
starting from Monday , when possible .
the ad was five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she would have had a year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
in the third commentary was written by &quot; a girl from the inner inner country , which would like to work . &quot;
then , the author of the ad turned out once again :
Dear friends , I found one . I look like it works with her .
thank you , I am writing again when something is .
the shop was complete .
in the pro@@ log@@ ue to the report Cri@@ ad@@ itas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ ad@@ itas , how long still ? ) , a collection of witness to former cri@@ ad@@ itas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our story we managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay ) , the Con@@ qu@@ ist@@ ad@@ ores , who received the Spanish conqu@@ ist@@ adors in Paraguay , and they that have been willing to agree that many girls and boys participate in a system of slavery , where they are light victims of abuse and exploitation .
the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the show of power are the key to the understanding of phenom@@ ena , known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
legisl@@ ature writes Egyptian social media to register with the government
picture of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , changed from Global Vo@@ ices .
published under Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian par@@ li@@ ds ordered a bill to &quot; regul@@ ating the regulations regarding the use and commercial social networks . &quot;
if he is accepted by Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt with government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
based on the law , then a place would be set up which was instructed to share social media citizens and citizens .
within six months with the acceptance of the law , useful and users have to register with their right names and number of staff numbers to use social networks .
if it f@@ ails to do this , this may cause a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine .
the bill , which consists of six paragra@@ phs , and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt records , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de Application , which is running over the Internet and is used to communicate with others by means of voice , video messages and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how the law is going through when the draft is being accepted , as it is not clear that the Egyptian government should not register the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure that the Egyptian government is currently able to ensure the regulation on the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , parliamentary delegation and supporters of the Legislative state , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a user name and password to come by the fire@@ wall , which blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to establish a fire@@ wall on national level around Facebook . due to them it would be necessary to submit to the Egyptians for Egyptians and Egyptians to access the network .
but it is not known so far that such plans exist .
experts and experts on site are sc@@ ep@@ tical regarding the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the fore@@ front .
Ram@@ y R@@ ao@@ of , Senior Research Engineering ( based on German &quot; Leader &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egypt &quot; Initiative for personal Rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I have strong in the technical capacity and the understanding of neither authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that the same as they are violent in physical public and private spaces , it may also be done online .
if I mean it , then this means that they shall apply a strong surveillance system to request citizens , which apply a permit or not . and that means a mad system to monitor the activities of people and also to provide a judicial process .
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
in order to be approved as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the legisl@@ ature of Parliament and the Constitutional committee , before it goes into the plenary .
whether his acceptance and exercise successfully will be successful or not , the draft &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military monument in parliament , whose sens@@ es will maxim@@ izes control and ensured that no deviation on the image surface is &quot; says R@@ ao@@ of .
last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sh@@ ah@@ aw@@ y struck a bill of law against cy@@ ber crimin@@ ality , which is intended to be found guilty of life imprisonment for those who are guilty to thre@@ aten &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest &quot; in protest . &quot;

high above the mountains of the Kurdistan region in the northeast of Iraq work the veter@@ an H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq to protect the intellectual Persian Leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which arise by Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are always found due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , loss and fra@@ gment their lifetime and since they are always less prey .
why is this specific type of le@@ op@@ ard important ?
like R@@ aza in the video , &quot; the Persian Gulf is the only remaining noise in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and the th@@ ri@@ ves of ecos@@ ystem also depends on that a large noise is present .
the chance to watch a Persian Leop@@ ards in the free game is small and goes against zero . as the team in the video is therefore a great cat that they have a great cat in the camera that leaves R@@ aza in pure joy .
as a educ@@ ated Bi@@ olog@@ in shows R@@ aza passionate and another side of her country , which consists of only war and conflict .
it has been involved in wild animals for six years and involved educational programs in Nature Iraq for six years .
since 2013 , she has also been a member of IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and assumes that protection zones for wildlife will be set up in the Kurdistan region .

at the beginning of March 2017 , the daily newspaper K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ en@@ o , which was achieved for the nor@@ theastern Japan &apos;s daily newspaper K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ ut@@ o , which were affected by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; triple disaster &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had caused the cat@@ astrophe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ ann@@ o Newspaper has its registered office in Sen@@ dai , which was in the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a common pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring communities Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had van@@ ish the coastal towns of the map .
even the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still experienced an atomic accident , some 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses .
the special report of K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ en@@ o shows from a local point of view which was achieved six years later to re@@ build the life of local communities .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both the statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as the survey results of the affected themselves .
construction industry in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ en@@ o Newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement parts ( in the bu@@ ckets of the Steel , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to see the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , 80 per cent of the planned spare parts were finished .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima joined the final light with 70 percent .
even six years later , six years after the cat@@ astrophe , evacu@@ ated by accommodation accommodations ( Cat@@ ap@@ le , kas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) , moved to the final spare parts .
after the triple cat@@ astrophe , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in accommodation categories .
in December 2016 , 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such accommodation .
in 2011 , the evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in not@@ aries , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a successful one . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated evacu@@ ated after the deser@@ ti@@ ers were settled in final homes .
for I@@ w@@ ate the number is 34 percent here .
the stand of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o Newspaper , we have affected 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which have been affected by the disaster until December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction is far more difficult in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
while almost 100 per cent of fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i have now been in operation , only 30 percent of fishing ports have been re @-@ recorded .
ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident have moved in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land large area .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of the ar@@ able land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 per cent destroyed the farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
it is un@@ likely that this is only a result of the atomic fact , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed the farm@@ land area of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , lying in the &quot; nuclear war zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , the tourism again re@@ covers again , but again Fu@@ kus@@ hima still remains unbe@@ aten .
the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again up to 90 percent in the same stand as before the mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hima joined the same stand here only 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ ann@@ o Newspaper also reports that since the cat@@ astrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it was as difficult to earn their hab@@ itat .
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to determine a total image , the newspaper conducted numerous surveys under the native population and under the evacu@@ ation of the evacu@@ ation . it also asked them about the state of re@@ building and also how their indig@@ nation gets changed over the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in the introduction of the article , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ en@@ o Newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ ann@@ o led a survey carried out in order to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the native population in experience .
the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken their actions to be prepared on future earthquake and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.9 percent of respon@@ dents say that still not enough in the stuff of cat@@ astroph@@ es had been done .
as to those who are evacu@@ ated from the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
in its issue to the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o Newspaper has strengthened its attention even on the location of evacu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima had not only to experience the massive earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also witness of the worst , disast@@ rous consequences , nuclear accident , who ever had to experience Japan .
of 160 000 evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside of the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , some more than 23 000 people were moved back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in permanent spare parts .
after the 2017 stand there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside their home pre@@ fecture .
most of the evacu@@ ated areas are most of the evacu@@ ation , who still have to be back in the right accommodation , because the efforts for the re@@ building of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima have to compete with massive construction projects . here is the building projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will be held in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our po@@ d@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
if people meet people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences appear to be bigger than the simil@@ ar@@ ities .
however , after a while , however , you often know that one more connects than it appears to the first glance .
these global connections are important because they will make out our advantages , our perspectives bro@@ aden and remember that the world finally is very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices of Pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global links . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast , we will treat topics that they often get fewer attention than they earn .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who recall a moment where they have felt very strongly connected with someone about language and country borders .
Veron@@ ika Kri@@ con@@ i speaks about the simil@@ ar@@ ities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ eta Camar@@ asa reminds about the time where they worked with people from all over the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences which he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian active activ@@ ist in artificial Kom@@ a , after he was defeated by the police in national demonstrations
on the left : the attack against Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Luz . publication with permission .
right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva at a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was included in the intensive care unit : last Friday , a police officer had defeated him in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia a demonstration against the head . nationwide millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against savings .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ trau@@ ma and several fre@@ tions .
doctors took him on this Saturday and then put it into a artificial compass .
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus which quickly spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures there is also the face of the police officer , which was identified with a stroke attack . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police announced in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the investigation of the investigation of the active service was suspended .
the pictures show the police officer , as he performs in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his impact on the face of students Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
it would be a police officer from a demonstr@@ ators and landing on the intensive care station , his face would be seen for six months in television and the entire repression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , divided by Lu@@ iz da Luz , distributed by Lu@@ iz da Luz , where one sees , as Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several sanitary shortly afterwards to it .
another video with the same scenes , but from a different perspective , is also immersed in the social networks .
in the below shown clip you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50th second .
for the Mat@@ eus family who lives in another state of state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian Re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover a part of the costs for medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be bra@@ ve , Mat@@ eus .
against police force . &quot;
the drawing was dealt with several times in social networks .
by : H@@ eit@@ or Vil@@ ela . publication with permission .
on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls another non@@ violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás experienced a wave of political power : here , the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish of his father was murdered ; and here we have been attacked the very sad school of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who has been attacked by a polic@@ emen who has beaten him with a strike in his face .
police over@@ handles
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil in which it came to protest@@ ers in the past Friday .
polic@@ emen trained at the protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had prepared a stage for Red@@ ner , Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
member of Fl@@ avi@@ o Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) , asked the police to ren@@ ounce violence against demonstr@@ ators .
this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country .
once again , the Brazilian media road prot@@ ested by making the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists , a window plate .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported a target of a broken glass windows to illustr@@ ate with a photo its title pages illustr@@ ative .
in contrast , the O Glob@@ o wrote a title story with a fire on fire .
there is no pl@@ au@@ sible journ@@ alistic foundation , more about a broken window plate as about the protests of thousands of people who serve the defence of a special thing to report .
this must be seen also if you are stri@@ pe against any type of damage .
here also , the term &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; is a ab@@ sur@@ d , disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate , and the typical violent actions of the military police are marked by head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators &quot; at the con@@ front@@ ation course with the police . &quot;
the forgotten villages in Cuba from the discover@@ ies in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso used almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba ( Photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
the Con@@ gregation Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , who is located in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ abe@@ que , is widely known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - known , regardless of that there is no n@@ enn@@ ess sugar spot on site .
it is two years ago , when the activities were fabri@@ cated in the sugar tube factories .
after that , the sugar tube industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost after and after its installations , until only the rum@@ or of steel and concrete remained .
approximately 272 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent itself .
some changes the work .
other re@@ signed and comm@@ utes daily to the factories that still grin@@ d .
N@@ ene , a solo veter@@ an , which rises every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar tube industry does not produce his sleep .
he list@@ ened to that in the eastern region of the region of sugar rubber factories , which are again in operation after a long intimate time , because they have been preserved .
that was something that he was not expected .
N@@ ene is remin@@ is@@ cent of the fact that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich would receive the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar tube industry is already the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the I@@ ne@@ ff@@ efficiency , the bad administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , the production of 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced .
the message would have been a motive for decades before some decades , but the poor earth have already been no re@@ jection anymore .
why was Cub@@ an sugar tube industry turned off ?
the old rail sti@@ ff of the congregation saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
the rein@@ forcement of the sugar tube industry was an economical solution : the 155 sugar tubes factories were technically ob@@ sol@@ ete , and hardly competitive for the country .
the initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes .
they just left the factories which can produce sugar for maximum 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the moti@@ fs that led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar tubes and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price increased again about one decade ago .
from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report , &quot; Land@@ wirtschafts@@ sper@@ spek@@ tiven &quot; from the OECD and FAO , the Agricultural and Food Organization of the United Nations .
if current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar level would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country .
not all ran well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present day will enter in history &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first words of the Cub@@ an President Fi@@ del Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the Sug@@ ar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from there , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , a total of 98 sugar tubes produced , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training .
it was the same thing in the sugar cane factory Gregori@@ o Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene is known as a soldier , on the closure of the factory , the word that he is repeated most repeated , &quot; fr@@ aud . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down .
in order to receive the place , they were a full time - Working Group .
before the first shot year , the first letters began to come .
in order to be officially written documents relating to the parts that would be removed , the address and the date are distinguished .
all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could over@@ take any withdrawal .
since then , the responsibility and letters came always more common .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the l@@ act@@ ating factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the still used sugar cane factories . &quot;
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , is waiting for the pension in another facility , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was in charge of his will at the dis@@ closure of the factory in which he helped to participate .
with every part that he was removed , he was dismant@@ led in one of his 31 working years .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important workplace producers was removed out .
in many cases , there were no alternatives to work stations and services provided by the plants in the congregations where they were created .
we will never know if during the mamm@@ oth address given to the eyes of 21 October 2002 , then President in the eyes of the present people saw that for those areas , whose factories were not in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar tubes
since 2004 , sugar cane is extracted only high by grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
after two years , the People &apos;s Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things will change , but not always to better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar tube factory was completed , or better , when they began to dis@@ close them , they also list@@ ened to asphalt roads , they also part@@ akers other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy other factories had to seek .
they have been added to spare parts .
without the future perspective , many young people left the region .
in the area a food factory was created , whose production is not for the supply of the church .
the ruins of the factory behind the new system are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty awak@@ ening to the old soldiers bring a few thousand Pes@@ o per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is no subsequent person , nevertheless he gives the lies that they told him not .
they tor@@ ment him for ten years .
N@@ ene is with 65 years old in R@@ ente , not because it is not lacking in force , but because he is bitter .

first Nations teen@@ ager use Hi@@ p @-@ Hop to express yourself and receive your own culture
recording of a song of &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ ass@@ y Nar@@ rows First Nation .

you@@ ths of the First Nations communities in all Canada are related to topics that are important for them . do they do through Hi@@ p @-@ Hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an @-@ Tour will bring home theater studios directly to schools and youth centres , for youth groups Song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live appearances .
the original workshops were led by the ped@@ agog@@ ues David Hod@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and in Nord @-@ Quebec with ten cre@@ e communities and then with the Cre@@ e Hi@@ p @-@ Hop @-@ group The North@@ Stars .
the workshop is thus increasing that the young participants in discussions related issues such as &quot; cultural identity , language , strug@@ gles , love , self @-@ acceptable , or whatever it occurs in the sense .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos , where young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team worked together with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the trunk of the Win@@ ev@@ ago in the US state Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Y@@ oo , in the field of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First nation in British Columbia , is known for example the history of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; in the almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered .
the cases were not resolved .
the next video of the Nem@@ hi First Nation uses the motif of a video player to mediate , how important the receipt of traditional customs and customs of customs in spite of influences by glob@@ alization .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people do not always rule the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First nation recorded , the refra@@ in is sung in Cre@@ e .
the young people received some help by Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ stars Hi@@ p @-@ Hop Group , who gave them a st@@ rop@@ he in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
at the fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an stands the st@@ rop@@ he in writing , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel , no one would ever be interested in me
but I &apos;m trying to go on earth to go on earth
this is the day when you will take to our Schre@@ i ?
because we lost our way in life as a youth
but I believe that we will rise up a day
I don &apos;t want to see how to live a bad life
how can they grow and lead them as well as our youth
so you can do that , for what the Creator has determined

in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic shred@@ ded ( cru@@ is@@ ers ) outside of typical restaurants in Japan .

in Japan you can see almost any restaurant of plastic dishes .
to show potential customers what exactly will be on the menu , are in the vicinity of the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( in the bu@@ ckets , &quot; Plastic models of dishes &quot; ) which will be served in this restaurant .
customers check out these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or pass through .
there is a whole industry that is dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the to@@ ki@@ oter district K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi there is a variety of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes created by the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
most Japanese are these plastic dishes as usual that they are not even more ref@@ using to them . however , a new trend is transformed into con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous cell accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
at N@@ aver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos to show this unusual tw@@ ist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin .
now in special sale : new with plastic gr@@ ated mobile bands , as they are shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u Kauf@@ haus .
many of these artificial foods have been changed to kit@@ ten collector , as in this case , refrigerator mag@@ nets :
here are a few sho@@ ot@@ ch cool@@ ers for a new exhibition in Tokyo Station .
the new boom of essence is increasingly sophisticated .
in this case , an imperi@@ al @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile phone support .
for these tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found as a mobile phone support a good use .
we also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is a apple , which can hold your mobile phone :
designed to look like a apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that &apos;s only the beginning of an increasing flight .
some mobile phone support and mobile designers allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura or salmon was used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doub@@ ts :
if there would be someone who say , &quot; Wow , cool , now I can feel my mobile phone with salmon ? &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes may also accept a less appet@@ ite form , for example colleagues or family members un@@ pleasant to surprise .
our latest mobile phone support has the shape of melting the ice .
in addition , there are rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and wrist@@ bands from dried salmon .
other sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic dishes can view yourself under : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s N@@ aver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter The h@@ ash@@ tag # 4 .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trends , then this video gives you an insight into the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district , which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry . like for example with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin @-@ purple .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic was actually produced .

in reports of in@@ - and foreign media over the not@@ orious &quot; struggle against drug trade &quot; in Mexico , the mis@@ ery and che@@ ers are regularly used in statistics . however , these reflect not the extent of the human tragedy against that fight against this battle .
the reporting on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the boss of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cartridge , pressed the stories of the conflict entirely in the background .
a day after a violent incident looks hardly any man looking upon the tragedy or to the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
behind each strip , behind every bone re@@ funds in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never heal .
therefore , the Mexican news portal of the Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico is the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; dealing with the drug trade &quot; ) , that these victims shall give a voice and stories of people who were talking about the battle between the prosecution authorities and cart@@ els .
the Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organiz@@ ational crime does not allow us to fear our lives .
the impact are much deeper .
for example , if shops close because they are threatened by drug tra@@ ders and whole communities have to drive many kilometers to buy something as milk as milk .
the pain of the Vic@@ tims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( german : &quot; like fear of life &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who sear@@ ches every weekend secret graves after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who lost their father , four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her neph@@ ew .
priest : &quot; as every Sunday we prepare for us today again the task of looking for us to get rid of the graves after the people who loved us . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric store in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13 he left the house .
on October 15th he should be back again , but he never returned . Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very difficult for me because I am now with three children who need a training .
there is also my mother who is also here with me .
at the moment she has no income .
you will receive the insurance of my father , but they won &apos;t pay it out , because they ask a death certificate .
where should we get that ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co , &quot; why the project is so important :
we must not only show the faces of those that are anxi@@ ety . we must show the international community the conflicts to show the sm@@ ooth@@ ness and the state of the state .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some ex@@ cer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reading of animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Europe .
your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I &apos;ve been aware of the disease and Sens@@ ational journ@@ alism for some years now .
I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the title pages with pictures which can only come from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or from Ak@@ ten of specialists .
it brings me from the version .
sometimes I have the feeling when I am the only thing that I g@@ ged or sad . it acts as a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I can not be equal , or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
no , it is not normal that my 10 year old c@@ ousin wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) if it is great . and it is not normal that people listen to the &quot; Hel@@ ours &quot; of the offen@@ ders &quot; when they go through the streets .
for me , this is what would they have lost to those who have lost someone and those who have fear them so something happened .
I see our weakness , if stories are to be naked numbers in a statistic .
the facts of human beings is incredible for me when the death of six people and the en@@ forced dis@@ appearances of 43 students in a neighboring resort to be justified . &quot;
I think they are trying to talk that they are spar@@ ed by such tragedy if they are not stirring and still .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four Mon@@ ths to be spo@@ iled in the capital city : like a family with dro@@ pl@@ ings , &quot; it describes how armed crime month was pressed for month money from their business until they had not only destroyed the store , but also her family apart .
you think all that you have lost and remember how some people can change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain per@@ verse over it , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again , when you are alone .
hab@@ its have changed , phone numbers also .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
depending on the other , we are better .
she finished her report with the words :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to be arrested , because they don &apos;t know when they will lead you or kill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I asked for myself in these fe@@ ar@@ ful days , if weeping would have lifted up my deep@@ est feelings , but the answer is no , for I forgot to learn how to weep . I must learn to live with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence .
in the introduction , he gave questions on how : who car@@ es for the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crimes ?
how is it to grow in a settlement at the edge of the most dangerous town of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age whose parents take care of her .
Br@@ yan is a f@@ ather@@ less and he tells that he had to bring together a egg , potatoes br@@ ils , tortillas , and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of fl@@ ac@@ on with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left B@@ one - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live .
when he was five years old , one told him that his mother disappeared .
but this was not the day that his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years before , when he was only a few blocks away from his home , the bloody dead bodies of his father was shot , who was shot by armed men from a vor@@ ced car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence through organized crime and struggle against the already existing social problems mixed in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of Mor@@ de according to the number of civil council for public security and government of the government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the Public Prosecutor of 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to average 8.5 Mor@@ den per day .
these are only a few hundred thousands of stories that inv@@ ading the organized crime in Mexico , and enter into the soul of the country .
only few stories live in view of the new head@@ lines . this project reminds us of those who are not forgotten .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; project , Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has set up the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to set the complex information behind the failed fighting against the drug trade , which has pe@@ eled the country in the last four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand true words
&quot; Sh@@ aring is Car@@ ing &quot; from Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages , to which he ver@@ ts , include pictures , on which violence is depicted .
the fact check is important at a moment in which it comes to raise a rum@@ or or f@@ ake a f@@ ake .
but how is the years after something the first time emerged ? content in social media , whether it is true or un@@ true , tend to continue to exist .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident 7 years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first publication it has been used ir@@ re@@ inst@@ re@@ ate , tragedy that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false copy of pictures and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Draft News - denied not the fact that there is plenty of careful report on events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it th@@ rows questions about our desire to find pictures .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 a tan@@ kers crossed the place S@@ ange from the East of the DR Congo , til@@ ed and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war , Africa had been neg@@ le@@ cted in the second largest country for years . the streets in the region have become dangerous stro@@ kes full of stro@@ kes , which were difficult to walk .
the tank remains to the victim of the tank .
government representatives described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses , including a cinem@@ as close , which was full of people who illustr@@ ate the football World Cup .
houses viol@@ ated and stolen bodies were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to ignor@@ ance .
an image with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur users Myst@@ ical Monkey , 12 . January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the gray scenes of this day .
above is an example .
it shows rows of dark body , which co@@ b@@ lows on the ground for people to watch them .
but here the story does not find her end .
over the years it became the same photo several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms , however , real but not in connection of the tragedy , particularly events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what and what does not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , the fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the un@@ le@@ gen@@ eric villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
Aug@@ enz@@ eu@@ gen reported dra@@ stically of atro@@ cities , they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies were burned in streets and bones .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers could not be confirmed but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody remained back to count the bodies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a population on Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were z@@ ump@@ ed , shot or burned .
only using satellite images the follow @-@ up could be illustrated .
the reason for the attack remained un@@ certain , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the Military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am , country to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the image taken out of the DR Congo again , as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this mis@@ ses use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of failure ; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the image was introduced as a letter for mass graves .
another step further bring personal comments like this example de@@ pl@@ ating the image from the DR Congo with the sources of mass media in connection to supply arguments .
the picture from S@@ ange came also in conjunction with the fatal persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash message , the United Nations describes those who were able to flee rape and some dead , some by burning .
while others reported from violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Post@@ s reported that these descriptions made with photos from the DR of Congo :
this picture comes from an aci@@ di @-@ Arab News page , who claimed 2012 failed to participate in the assassination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , in addition to the assassination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to illustrated this information .
the original contribution , which was last updated on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organisations , the AF@@ P as its source , had also attributed this statement , but did not show this picture from the DR Congo in connection .
the worldwide range of false information
traces of wrong c@@ ros@@ spo@@ ons are back to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from anywhere in all over the world .
using a &quot; inver@@ ted picture search &quot; you can see how far more information can be exceeded .
a converted picture @-@ search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 344 images under 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are similar to the illustrated picture from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed lot of private parties , platforms social media and community , as well as national publications and are in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some wrong reports have led for@@ warded , they have tried to expos@@ e the f@@ uses .
we have applied examples for the mis@@ ery use and they related to the respective countries , based on which side they had been published , so we want the reach more explic@@ it than through the language alone .
several examples of ab@@ hor@@ ted use can be used from the bottom @-@ listed countries ( which were included in some cases ) .
here are some cases which can now be split completely up ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
geographical samples of wrong copy of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange @-@ mentioned countries point on pages or servers , which are still available in the examples of counter@@ f@@ ake or fal@@ seh@@ ood .
the countries in grey are examples that are available according to the met@@ ad@@ ata and information provided by Tin@@ Eye , probably due to maturity .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed in Algeria and interested Arab@@ s ) as part of a thread to &quot; war of Budd@@ hist@@ s against Muslims . &quot;

Canada , 2015 .
in this article , a blo@@ gger from Quebec City is not just the wrong message , but also avo@@ red the mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions according to the intensity of persons and the wick@@ e@@ dies ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) .
Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; EN Nigeria est@@ án qu@@ em@@ ando a los Crist@@ ian@@ os &quot; ( In Nigeria she burn the Christians ) .
in this article about explo@@ sions in North @-@ Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , the district is identified as the Christian part of the village .
La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica quotes as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( which is not known whether the original report has included the picture ) .
France , 2015 .
T@@ wit@@ ter@@ contributions after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am , like this here , which used the image from the DR Congo to illustr@@ ate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam , &quot; have clearly seen no pages such as Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster , which contra@@ di@@ ct this .
Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster named the incorrect use of the image since 2011 in conjunction with Nigeria , then promoted by a post of U.S. American , anti @-@ Islamic comm@@ it@@ ators Pam@@ ela G@@ eller .
Germany , 2017 . &quot; genocide against Muslims are continuing silent in Myanmar , Peace Nobel Peace . &quot;
this article gives attention to the continuous emergency of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims in Myanmar , but quotes the work of an article by the Indian Express with the picture from the DR Congo ; the article of Indian Express had not included this picture at the time of publication of our article .
Greece , 2012 . &quot; branches off the party !

this asser@@ tion was contra@@ cted by a Greek fact check @-@ site in 2013 and once again in 2016 .
Iran , 2012 .

Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme example for an ab@@ dic@@ tory use of the image from the DR Congo , on the other hand , the sympath@@ y opposite the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , and on the other attempt of a blo@@ g@@ gers , the claims , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya are pursued , as well as the photos are mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
the government of Myanmar released a reference to what they came as &quot; deliber@@ ately fing@@ ered News and Photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understanding concerning Myanmar . &quot;
this judge , which has been published exclusively in English also includes references to counter@@ f@@ ake images of rum@@ ors that are used by H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and by extrem@@ ist groups to kill that Muslims are killing and elsewhere ( which often is widely distributed by Bur@@ m@@ ese national@@ ists ) .

this post , which addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , is clear that the image of the DR Congo does not show Muslims who killed Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this message claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein was claimed that the mon@@ ks and politicians have been involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , and brought the story together with the picture from S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture continues to include .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article of 2014 about students who were recorded by the B@@ oko Har@@ am has been published , published by the Catholic University of An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has explicitly stated that the picture was not taken by the T@@ öt@@ tle , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar d@@ utch @-@ dist@@ ic assault . &quot;
when the picture later seen in connection with the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am from 2015 in circulation , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to contra@@ dic@@ ate these connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Y@@ an@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ fertilizers y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria bur@@ ns , the world sleeps ) .
the image of the DR Kongo appeared with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and dissolved a discussion among Muslims after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the stop on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to reach this events that their communities took place in the name of the Is@@ l@@ ams , a greater attention .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was pushed as a letter to the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ) . but the messages that were associated with it were taken in no religious context .
instead , the goal was to judge attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media reports compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( ese ) , 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a message that had been written by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Nig@@ eri@@ an mass@@ acres , there were some discussion for@@ ums like this here in Vietnamese and declared it to Fal@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the message , in which the picture was included in the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ ics mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os .
there are further confirmed examples of an incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other Ac@@ counts , generators and sites in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) , Tin@@ Eye also has not completely tra@@ ce@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with UR@@ Ls and tim@@ - / date stamp exist on the Web@@ cra@@ wler and have to have a picture file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which has been published only after the original accident of 2010 , the picture finally carries a correct description but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two powerful topics or frames ( frames ) , which are going through this post . the first frame focus on religion .
the photo was used in terms of greater discussions about the silence in connection with the ex@@ h@@ ort@@ ation of Christians by Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the ex@@ h@@ ort@@ ation of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as through Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second Fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how a African life is assessed compared to a European or French life .
religion understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worthwhile to examine how images are used in connection with this effort .
but a deeper question is , however , what happens if reading this pictures doesn &apos;t need longer faith .
with social media , there are only people who have un@@ inten@@ tional share of water around a tragedy .
sug@@ ger@@ ated this mood of the failure and false information that the actual atro@@ cities are un@@ real and tast@@ es the real cra@@ cks of what actually happened in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and in Myanmar ?
the dis@@ sem@@ ination of for@@ ci@@ ble images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
an argument is that the re@@ tention of images of a ref@@ usal comes to recognize the tragedy . sometimes , these images are even required by the victims .
at the same time the concern is that the for@@ ci@@ ble images of readers and audience will take the ability to feel Em@@ path@@ y ( such as such a study that sought how for@@ ci@@ ble media to work , others ) .
while there is a lot of for@@ ci@@ ble represent@@ ations in the news media , fact that they are indisp@@ ens@@ able for today &apos;s news report .
techn@@ ologists have experim@@ enting with algorith@@ ms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake news . &quot; they will thoroughly consider thinking about the situation in which a picture should have been replaced , but also replaced by the context or completely viol@@ ate species .
however , any examination should be considered internationally , however , should also be considered internationally .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uni@@ qu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo of Andy Simmons uses CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ tran@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. un@@ translated ) , language enthusi@@ astic a selection of words from all over the world , which are difficult or not to translate at all .
such words are in any language : you are certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese acid ) and others that are deeply ro@@ oted in a special culture ( for example , the Spanish so@@ dom@@ esa ) .
but all resist persistent every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not sufficient , why a full explanation and sometimes something context is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for a full time in an online list .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , during the author and Lingu@@ ist by &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird , to concentrate on small languages .
for example , in the blog you can find words from the V@@ anu@@ at@@ u V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , like :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Bem@@ ü@@ h yourself for your parents in recognition of what you have lab@@ oured in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ wick Language which are spoken in parts of Brazil , like :
&quot; kw@@ adi &quot; - the ease of comfort or sl@@ oth , which one feels in cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words out of his blog About :
they escape other cultures , reveal another Ged@@ ank@@ ets and we@@ ave our cur@@ i@@ osity .
sometimes , consider how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the Lingu@@ ists on this page still want to show more of these &quot; un@@ translated &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
Red@@ ner of the &quot; Treasure Languages , &quot; which are very appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to invite their favourite words here .

like Sri Lanka with the worst flood cat@@ astrophe of the decade
the is@@ let of Sri Lanka currently sees the worst high water and fire cat@@ astrophe in this decade .
triggered by Mon@@ sun , which usually starts at the end of May , are caused by strong rain@@ drops to the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ sson and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country on the shore .
following a position of the disaster of Sri Lanka , from May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundreds of humans are missing because of the floods and sl@@ ud@@ la@@ vers .
more than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100 000 people were brought to 304 safe areas .
the rain falls on Saturday ( 27 May ) and the water@@ stocks in some areas went slowly .
health and hygiene ratios of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected areas and still un@@ accessible areas .
the following images and videos dealt a impression of the extent of the Fl@@ ut@@ cat@@ astrophe :
high water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama City with water levels of up to 7,5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka are providing regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the cat@@ astrophe .
Sri Lanka &apos;s dead@@ ly floods wor@@ ms the Den@@ gu@@ e@@ fi@@ e@@ ber@@ gh crisis , Save the Children , after additional rainfall are already on the way .

the Air Force has made five planes for rescue operations and another five are made for transport of emergency supplies which were completed in their floo@@ ded villages .
various organisations and start@@ ups have also been preparing to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od V@@ IC@@ TI@@ MS in Sri Lanka and 2017 disaster relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information about flood situation and humanitarian assistance .

use j@@ ig@@ t.@@ Dam@@ as in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour &apos;s gir@@ l@@ friend .
I trusted her my four year old daughter , she tru@@ sts to me their children . she is my rock in the fire .
in one minute , we call slo@@ gan@@ s for the rights of women .
in the next time we add rights to Trans@@ gender .
we are located in a sea of Rainbow and people , some keep the i@@ con@@ ical image of a woman with head cloth , bound from an American flag , other sk@@ en@@ code slo@@ gan@@ s against Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my gir@@ l@@ friend looks like me and say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things are not about you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Mus@@ lim@@ a ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask myself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already led this entertainment .
people , with whom I am working or people who know me since years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar that they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built themselves in their performance .
they re@@ comp@@ assed me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all equal .
we practic@@ ed our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , on different species , but somehow we will all be put into the same Muslim drawer .
these drawer is well constructed in our collective introduction such as soon as Muslims who are not sor@@ ting there , un@@ mus@@ cl@@ ed .
Dis@@ pos@@ es Will Be Dis@@ mis@@ ed
I don &apos;t stand alone .
that &apos;s even the poet , whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images are in the sense when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an orthodo@@ x@@ ty pre@@ acher pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Kor@@ an and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry .
but in the western presentation the Religion Rum@@ is was deleted , as well as the most popular translations of its poetry .
this del@@ etion makes a great part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists of the induc@@ tive images of Muslims , which have been colon@@ ized by Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting image language is determined by the dark man that you should fear and the exotic woman that should be saved .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid presented the history behind this pictures in the 1970s .
but these pictures are still on today .
our polit@@ ician , the news industry and Hollywood they continued .
I &apos;ve been working in the news industry for thirteen years and I have seen how this powerful , faul@@ ty Nar@@ rative continues to domin@@ ate our news@@ fe@@ eds .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v survived the reality that led to nine Muslim women in the last three decades , while the United States could not take their first female presidential candidate in the USA in 2016 .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v failed to recogn@@ ise that if French , Muslim women are prevented to bear their head@@ cloth in public buildings and to cover sau@@ di @-@ Arab , Muslim women to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this severe Nar@@ rati@@ onal weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it sees that the first Muslim prayers were spoken in amer@@ ican soil by Afri@@ kan@@ ers , which were brought to this way with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v has occupied our collective fo@@ res@@ sive strength of der@@ art deeply and def@@ ective , that often S@@ ik@@ h @-@ men and children are aiming for target @-@ tim@@ ed attacks and shots .
because of these stories we tell us and because of the kind where we tell them , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot;
belong to the 1.7 billion
in the news industry we do more than just stories that are based on facts .
or at alternative facts .
we also create fol@@ ds to understand the world to understand the world .
and my industry is well @-@ thought to capture the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we left here where seven million Muslims who make up the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one @-@ third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ old Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the immig@@ rants of the first generation that come from 77 countries .

use approved .
four decades ago , my first parents came to live in New York to live their American dream .
my mother put her first gem design in 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; Wol@@ k@@ enk@@ rat@@ ers were made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time , when Khan had newly thought the Sky@@ lines of the World , my parents were illegal Muslims and Americans .
but am I now illeg@@ itim@@ ate Mus@@ lim@@ a and American ?
sometimes , if me ask me why I don &apos;t take a por@@ k , I say - instead of my Muslim recipes ? bring back all Muslims in themselves - &quot; from respect to pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I j@@ est@@ ing , we do not wear all hand@@ ker@@ ch@@ il with us .
we must also be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport .
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists that fight against Islam in well .
these lies are produced at the current band by a well @-@ decorated Islam@@ op@@ pression mechanism with money , th@@ ink tanks and experts for Fal@@ se information which is a Muslim picture of which is a Muslim ; or of what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell us and because of the kind , in which we tell them , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia exists in more than just a stranger that prov@@ oked the head cloth .
or as the resulting map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the USA , see below .

I want to declare this .
I was born when Mus@@ lim@@ a was born when I was born to Mus@@ lim@@ a in my pre@@ conception , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian Church in New York .

my Muslim faith and behavior are perhaps not visible but they are there .

she would see the all@@ ab@@ end@@ ental rit@@ ual with my daughter , when I kept them in my arms and to protect the Arab verses to protect the Kor@@ an , and the Q@@ ul@@ s are called .
I repeat three times each of them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that it is protected from evil , to evil , that one can see and evil , that one can &apos;t see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my Muslim faith is not always visible but my Muslim Brotherhood is always part of my shadow .

in the middle , while he wrote books about the modern Islam and over the independence K@@ asch@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana J@@ aan wept sore around his family in India , who did not close his arms in half a century .
belonging to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grandfather , were divided by col@@ oni@@ alists , who have shared the Muslim world as at the match risk .
Mus@@ lim@@ a means to know that in the last two centuries , Europeans were up to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ be was rejected in the history before a century above a Muslim country .
it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an in@@ humane , kiss of the British Empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; as he was the first mosque in England .
even before it was planes , he travelled to more parts of the world as I ever was and preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

an American mus@@ lim@@ a means to know that the self @-@ mor@@ ti@@ ate in veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means that if a tragedy that leads to the United States and the susp@@ ects a Muslim name , the story takes four times more than a story with a white attacks .
it means that four hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a free black slaves named Bil@@ al .
it means that two hundred years ago , a African Islamic Islamic schol@@ ar called Bil@@ ali Muhammad himself , and brought into this country .

to be a mother , to ensure my child , and all the Muslim children , well @-@ knowing that ma@@ stered and privileged persons on this twin structural Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia was created .
structural Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia exists in the Muslim registry , which began with President Bush and President Obama .
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists of immig@@ ration , who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in action .
it consists in a country that uses its borders opposite people from just across the countries that bom@@ bed it .
it is a wrong and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly list , &quot; which takes largely Arab@@ s and Muslims .
these are the wars that we lead and bombs the bombs we ab@@ sent to Muslim countries .
because of the stories we tell us and due to them that we do not tell us , we are here today .

Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversation we have to lead
we are too deep to reveal the Muslim or the &quot; others . &quot;
we are coming back to recognize the roots of our fears and the def@@ ective and dangerous educational prints which we are in our message inter@@ actions .
at least , there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , which tries to capture our most multiple ident@@ ities and forgotten history .
the po@@ d@@ cast Sea Som@@ e@@ thing , Say Som@@ e@@ thing by Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the po@@ d@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ Bad@@ Muslim ; the vir@@ al video series Secret Li@@ ves , an initiative , multiply Muslim authors to print and Ms mar@@ vel , the Pakistan , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope .

but I &apos;m concerned because of this difficult global point , in which we are located .
and this moment has consequences that go over the 1.7 billion .
there is a reason that con@@ spi@@ racy the@@ or@@ ist , which existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now lead the White House .
they have grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally because they made Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ ential by making the &quot; Other &quot; created .
a few years before it had not been given it , now they rule out big areas in Syria and Iraq .
I &apos;m concerned about the re@@ alities and history which I was not aware of me when I was old , as my daughter is now , but they made me today at an unknown mus@@ lim@@ a .
things I have left here like a baking lane in my speech .
things that may fear memories , because in all the inter@@ ctions that our humanity makes it , likes a story , where som@@ eb@@ ody is made to another &quot; others . &quot;
now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , Kon@@ vers@@ ations will take place in the context of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
more than a hundred academ@@ ics speak about our problems with the &quot; Other &quot; , &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American mil@@ itar@@ ism . &quot;

why do I tell this here at this T@@ ED@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how wars become , and people through the creating of the &quot; others &quot; in public presentation , who had been resear@@ ched by the Stan@@ ford about four decades ago .
we have to present themselves un@@ comfortable questions , after the role of what my gir@@ l@@ friend and I believe in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we do not have a president , the chocolate cake is bom@@ bed during which he had already capit@@ alized countries and &quot; to others &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for Typ@@ ical Art wants to preserve urban language diversity
history of history , Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Daniele Rossi , under the use of license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way to enter here and now in spite of a language barrier with someone in connection ?
for Steven Bird and Ro@@ by@@ n Perry , the founder of the Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) is an answer of stories in their original language .
global Vo@@ ices reported short about another initiative by Steven Bird , the Un@@ veil@@ ed Blog .
this is , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not written on the written but in the spoken word . it is an attempt to obtain the language diversity of great cities .
indeed , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already been conducted since 2015 , the risk that little and not all so small languages are not given to any children born there .
the project is valid for the makers of the Project :
the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided when we have cities to accept the di@@ ver@@ ity - safe areas where people don &apos;t forget to be in order to be .
during &quot; listening often , this is often connected to understand these events instead , &quot; the list@@ eners , to appreciate , to do . &quot;
in this format , hist@@ s represent their story initially in their own language and translate or explain it in English .
even if the participants are no professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their dev@@ otion and their depic@@ tion that the audi@@ ences can be found on it .
they call laugh@@ ter and emotions , than be the language no longer a barrier .
for example , the following video shows a traditional history dating from Burkina Faso , which will be told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the history of R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou cons@@ ulate also the opportunity to explain the country of typical customs of laws .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the f@@ abel of bun@@ ni@@ es and the P@@ avian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after he asked the meaning of his wr@@ ist , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara asked : &quot; how is it to talk to an audience , which will not understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ ass@@ y , he divi@@ des his feeling of content :
you have heard !
they were atten@@ tive ...
they were all with me !
to date , the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling took place in three cities , and the organis@@ ers hope to expand this . all those who are inspired by the project can compete with T@@ LS in order to organize their own history teeth .
Puerto Rico calls for the United States re@@ establish the state debt
with the aim of a new inspection of the public debt of Puerto Rico , who participated in a mass demonstration in the past 3 April 2017 , participated in a mass demonstration ; the march started in the pu@@ ert@@ orial Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went up to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group of &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Au@@ dit@@ or@@ ía de la Deu@@ da , &quot; ( civil front for the ne@@ ural examination of debts ) and the Ec@@ ological Con@@ gregation Puerto Ric@@ os .
the advoc@@ ate of the New Apostolic Church has also submitted a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the People of Puerto Ric@@ os calls for the politicians , banks and government agencies , who are responsible for the debts of their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we require a financial examination and an Ste@@ ering Committee without personal interests in public debts , with a fixed , our working conditions of appropriate re@@ mun@@ eration , who ag@@ ated in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will press and supp@@ ressed .
Puerto R@@ os people refuse to pay a debt that is not their .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not take care with sin@@ king pension payments .
we require immediate action .
the island - not in the Austrian citizen of the United States - suffered under a heavy financial crisis .
therefore , the &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a rule @-@ independent non @-@ profit organization without party representatives with a focus on soci@@ o@@ economic development , a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing government .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ric@@ os requires a broad re@@ structure of the state infrastructure .
from the outside of the outside , without the participation and convic@@ tion of the citizen shall exp@@ ire by the people .

the Syrian Web developer Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , is missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
over five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members leave the campaign for his freedom and remin@@ is@@ cent of the contributions which he made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : PU@@ BL@@ ICA , the annual conference on digital Culture held annually in Berlin , dedicated to the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist who produced in France @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director of Book spr@@ ints &apos; finished books within three to five days , l@@ ases ex@@ cer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive In@@ sured ( The Cost@@ s of Freedom : a collective post @-@ research ) .
the book that was published last year and here is licensed under , contains a number of inserts that deal with free culture in the face of op@@ pression .
it is a homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction , it is :
this book wants to identify how movements for free knowledge and what the true costs are , with which this is connected .
activ@@ ist , artist , designers , developer , researchers and authors that are involved in movements for free knowledge have been working on page to view over the neb@@ ula which gives our news@@ fe@@ eds and create something from our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , beloved and celebrated Internet volunte@@ er who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was kn@@ itted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison , which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then we have no information about his current state or residence .
the introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice who want to release his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom .
to see how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us let us start over their own dest@@ in@@ ies , actions and decisions .
why are we today here ?
what did we decide ?
what have we abandoned in this process of tim@@ ely extreme belie@@ fs ?
the web developer of Open Source and Digital activ@@ ist has been in prison for Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 Bas@@ sel was transferred from A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and lawyer in N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi reported that the &quot; military police bases on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; was taken away from the Military Court of his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she was contacted by persons on November 12 , 2015 , who had committed themselves to his husband himself as the Insider of the Assad government .
his residence and condition remains unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a crucial role in which to extend the Internet and knowledge of knowledge to the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist , and currently the leader of the new Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project , founded Bas@@ sel , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps there was none of Bass@@ els cultural prototypes , as the work which he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ m@@ yr@@ as .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important ar@@ che@@ ological sites in the world , was the signs of numerous civilian populations , and here are Greek @-@ Roman architectural types with hi@@ es@@ ous traditions and Persian influences .
Bas@@ sel could not know that ten years after being started working with this work , the IS would be everything that it would not only be the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world em@@ bodies out .
this strip is created in the digital archae@@ ology and the conservation has created a time capsule which will be the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of in@@ valuable value .
the base of this project could not yet un@@ lock this project .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband , his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my whole life to dream of freedom to dream and bas@@ sel taught me to emb@@ race her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel gave me English , even when he was already in prison .
I learned to read English and speak English .
he always has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he has taught other in@@ dem@@ nity to read and speak English .
Bas@@ sel opened my gate to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he has also brought other in@@ dem@@ ons as they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without knowing that they actually held one in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( waiting ) , a trial which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 , when he was in detention .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ our@@ a have worked together for a year .
she tast@@ ed the lyrics to him if they visited him and he translated them from the Arab in English .

Mos@@ ambi@@ que : sentenced to previous post @-@ handed charge because of corruption
Mos@@ ambi@@ ence responded with anger on a corruption , where a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his sentence .
this is a Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other def@@ endants because of im@@ per@@ ation of 54 million met@@ ik@@ al ( about 800 000 Euro ) .
the money came from public funds in the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , the Council of Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately asked his return to the company , which took place on 19 April .
in accordance with a statement of the General At@@ tor@@ ney of the Republic , which imp@@ aired the application , there would be no obst@@ acle for Cam@@ b@@ aza , back to his old post , since the company had no discipline in detention .
however , many residents are not good .
the Centre for Public integrity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution which concerns itself for public transparency , sentenced in an interview with the German Wave &apos;s decision to introduce the company &apos;s decision :
provides a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and in@@ explic@@ it the absence of transparency and is even a step in regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP .
what we have to know , that also the company would have to lead a discipline against the contra@@ dic@@ ating process .
however , the company kept silence , however , there is no appropriate legal steps to use the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Mos@@ ambi@@ que social media , re@@ jects this behaviour as well as &quot; conflic@@ ting &quot; :
if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent type , he would be advis@@ er when he was sentenced to prison in prison , and half of it has been canc@@ eled .
he could pay lectures and motiv@@ ating spe@@ ech@@ es , he could advise and pol@@ ishing his image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as he is in@@ competent , he has approved to become re@@ integrate into the company , which he saved damage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is glad@@ ly paid for his silence .
resist@@ ible !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ ence and student of Political Science in Brazil says , the director had no mor@@ als :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was rewarded by the state , because he inv@@ aded it , I cannot believe that one has rewarded someone in such a way that the state has already claimed so massi@@ vely .
Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing the mor@@ als and the state to serve as he had already been a unique opportunity to serve the state , but only himself served by the state instead .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was used the state , when handwritten it to an in@@ exhau@@ st@@ ible money source and the state itself is tired of this man who was loaded and finally sentenced to a long sentence .
hon@@ est@@ ly , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded .
Fran@@ ce@@ y Ze@@ ú@@ te is preferred to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mah@@ el to remember that a thief belongs to the prison :
th@@ iev@@ es belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mah@@ el , not only for ever as the first independent president in memory , but also as a scar@@ let , cutting and - by side - Proph@@ etic Red@@ ner .
one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations , when he was energet@@ ically confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man is to be able to sell his own individual interest , his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tac@@ tic , but he does not change over his amb@@ itions .
an ambitious man is a crime time . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also rejected :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment , he sat 10 years and came free .
and today , the company reli@@ es him again under the contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( @ az@@ mal _ ra@@ ik ) , May 12 , 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users
the bur@@ ial word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means K@@ ich@@ er@@ erb@@ ese or Sp@@ aging b@@ lows .

according to information on Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took her post from the net , because they ab@@ stain@@ ed the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although over the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to as@@ sign people to East Indian origin or general as an ad@@ jective . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook is licensed by the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in German text ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread issue of Hass@@ elt in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over the last few years , the ascent of radical national@@ istic movements gave the word an extremely abras@@ ive her@@ onn@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra @-@ national@@ ists as Hass@@ elt , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in the effort to fight Hass@@ elt in Myanmar , the company has cen@@ sored a lot of sen@@ su@@ al content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos;@@ mag today may usually be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word in itself does not call automatically Hass@@ elt .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that too , in which they have discussed the use of the word or have brought in doubt for the use of his usage , cen@@ sored :
in addition , there are several bur@@ ial words with basic different mean@@ ings that have the same book sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair will also be written on Bur@@ m@@ ese even &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as also as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ age ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ cy@@ tic A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at declared the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
one post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends about the rich species , if they knew how he could alle@@ ys his back pain by playing a voc@@ al game .
the proposition K@@ u la - &quot; Healing &quot; ( K@@ u ) + the Fra@@ ge@@ word ( la ) to Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win is the opinion that they will reduce Hass@@ elt &apos;s radic@@ ally national@@ ists , but also stressed that Facebook analy@@ tic needs to spread out all post @-@ ho@@ ists in sus@@ pic@@ ion , rac@@ ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not manually operated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it automatically filters the Word .
the Autom@@ ism will not understand what you write on fac@@ tions .
what to make it instead , is the post carefully to analyze and check it by check the words out .
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar Ht@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( dr@@ ills ) .
the good is that these dre@@ amed national@@ ists who spread Hass@@ elt , a rather good lesson .
now it &apos;s time to circumc@@ ise their national@@ ism .
while the action can send a strong signal to everyone who hate Hass@@ elt , the efficiency of this strategy does not hold long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have demonstrated that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of stro@@ kes often have a cat@@ - and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks will simply start to use a new word or alternative writing of the cen@@ sored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to er@@ ase his postal , when he wanted to divide his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned by the social network :
... when I was atten@@ tive to this new directive on Facebook , I made a post to announce my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
ir@@ on@@ ically , my mail has been removed from Facebook and it was prohibited for 24 hours , because the post &quot; Facebook community standards was not said . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of postcards from people who have no negative inten@@ tions or just trying to show their opinions against Hass@@ elt &apos;s radical national@@ ists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post has been removed , who has nothing to do with Hass@@ elt :
post without Hass@@ elt by Facebook .
in the post the author divided his opinion about why extreme national@@ ism and religious fundament@@ alism are bad@@ ly in the country .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook would have to do more before the beginning of the initiative , for example , the bur@@ mes@@ an Internet community asked advice :
Facebook may have a beneficial intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma by their platform , but it does not work .
to c@@ ate such words , even more hat@@ red within the different communities will bring it .
in addition , it seems , as if they have started without a local context or technical support , and as words as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; Gen@@ sen@@ curr@@ y . &quot;
even when they found out that they did not have bugs , they didn &apos;t tried to report the wrong post@@ age .
if they had only a bit more respect for the 15 million benefit , they would have a great turnover , would be great .
fac@@ eb@@ ooks automatic c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has ensured much fun among users .
instead of serious , users now do well @-@ fun and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of Hass@@ elt to see if their postcards are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook Post@@ s , which had no Hass@@ elt , but nevertheless removed :

the Bur@@ m@@ ian text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch the pe@@ eling curr@@ y and watch a Indian film .
just to try out if Facebook contains the mail , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you cure people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screenshot , with permission .
over the last five years , extreme national@@ ist ide@@ ologies and religious findings have been used to have social networks to expand their voices and their influence .
among other things , Hass@@ elt should preheat the violence in the municipalities in Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where disp@@ utes between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s were forced to flee .
Facebook was critic@@ ised for his failure , who would have to prove themselves on his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages under control .
but rather than just to c@@ ate the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have better ongoing , rather than on the context of concentr@@ ating initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is concluded with the children &apos;s House
a wedding ring in the sand .

the child before is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now .
on 9 June 2017 , Parliament &apos;s Parliament unanimously decided a law to offer this practice so that the marriage @-@ capable age is now 18 .
prior to this change of adul@@ ter@@ es@@ es , some members of Hin@@ du@@ istic and Muslim religious communities held at the practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mah@@ ar@@ aj , a group representing representatives of various religious groups in the country , that the state should not aff@@ ecting themselves , since that , at age not the maturity . &quot;
this happened un@@ certain@@ ed the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN children &apos;s Rights Convention , the minority , every man under 18 years &quot; defined .
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were married with 15 were married to Trinidad and Tob@@ ago 2.8 percent , and at 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the country &apos;s Statist@@ ical Office confirmed that between 1997 and 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 .
online pet@@ itions and social media movements who were ende@@ av@@ ed to abol@@ ish laws to the children &apos;s children , followed at the foot and mar@@ vel@@ ed great support . evi@@ d@@ led them to bring this result .
nevertheless not everything was smooth .
a Hin@@ du @-@ leader , for example , had no concerns to say the critics of the children &apos;s Before , they should be condemned , to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition approved for st@@ resses in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and sometimes came to doubt if the opposition would agree to the bill of law .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided in early 2017 - despite 4 Sen@@ ators ( among them a woman ) of the opposition and an independent which ab@@ stain@@ ed , so that he could make a simple majority in the House of Represent@@ atives .
now , only the President of the country has to vote and release the law .
one of the country &apos;s Sen@@ ators gave a status update to Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle returned to Inst@@ ag@@ ram again :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence R@@ amb@@ har@@ at : the bill for children before the House of Represent@@ atives was approved at the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes .
after having decided in the Senate , the draft may now be to the law .
the majority of social media users were thr@@ illed because the laws have been changed to children before finally .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , which was covered by a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has been too much time and un@@ necessary Ger@@ ede , which has swal@@ lowed up the core of the cause , but do you know what ? the child is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now , and that &apos;s worth every price .
while Abel Jackson , it was definitely enough to finish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was happy that the day was finally come :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ e - Thomas , which says : , Excellent news !
the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for free ! ! ! ! &quot;
after Mut@@ ota , the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil group that said quite openly about how important is the law of the law , noted :
the married age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now amounts to 18 years independently of religion .
the design for the change of Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ es was adopted today , on June 9 , 2017 .
in the House of Represent@@ atives there are 41 members and of which 35 were present at the voting .
all members of the accused were approved for the law .
the children &apos;s cribs are not allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago legal anymore .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # child@@ min@@ it@@ is@@ child@@ birth .
many thanks to all activists who have put it out .
congratulations .
a Dan@@ ke to our M@@ EP@@ s .
but a possible hook occurs in the form of Sat Mah@@ ar@@ aj , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du @-@ Organisation of the country .
before months , Mah@@ ar@@ aj has announced his intention to commit judicial steps , should the law be adopted , and he seems to redeem his promise .
during the General State At@@ tor@@ ney , Al ra@@ wi , a suppor@@ ter of the law , thought it would be quite righ@@ tly when Mah@@ ar@@ aj would like to proceed against the law , the most social media users would be challenged differently .
Patri@@ cia Wor@@ rel@@ l proposed :
Dear Sat , if we , instead of talking about the discussion , in a way that we would like to say , instead of the problem , that the state , our daughters from before , could say that they may be ab@@ used by major , hard @-@ ten@@ ds men who are mis@@ used to them , would you be willing to continue the discussion ?
or do you believe that there is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to a judicial proceedings against the law , or not , these legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the children &apos;s rights are legal or still the standard , although there are laws that they say .

Turkish users can look back on Wikipedia contents due to the web pages of websites .
the English @-@ language Wikipedia page was shown on 18 January 2012 , to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IPA Copyright Act in the USA , internationally distor@@ ted .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
since more than a month , Turkey has now closed the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle @-@ based enzyme clo@@ pe@@ dia Wikipedia .
day for Tag is clear how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information .
both students and repor@@ ter and fans of TV series runs against the pl@@ ess .
although many techniques are used to use envelop@@ es tools for blocked websites ( an earlier article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has not the third largest VPN pre@@ valent in the world ) , the most common Wikipedia users will not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been locking since 2008 by Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University will find regular blocking of the Internet since 2007 after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted .
after China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it goes around the massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains closed , there are now several Mir@@ ror pages ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and often are frequently updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) as the platform all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alized Peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. computer machine connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and therefore a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship is difficult .
the content of the content is decre@@ able despite the prohibition .
in a blo@@ g@@ post , IP@@ FS about his efforts :
after having heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we were all going to push the snap@@ shots of Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . this is the possibility to read the content on de@@ centr@@ alized and distributed mode .
this may help users to see at least all Wikipedia contents , even if they can &apos;t reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org itself .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step is independent of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it only works for screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Crist@@ ian Con@@ sol@@ i of Wik@@ im@@ edia in Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pä@@ .org , a Mir@@ ror page of Wikipedia , as well as Wik@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can take advantage of similar Mir@@ ror pages when in the respective country Wikipedia is closed .
Con@@ sol@@ i reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices and assist@@ ants at the Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i &apos;s Open Manifest@@ o &quot; Pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a Mir@@ ror .
one gets to another URL that is not the original . that what you see then is from Wikipedia .
essentially the server guides the request to the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself , if they are locked in Turkey .
for this is executed by a server which is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wild animal phot@@ ogra@@ f uses his camera to be atten@@ tive to the need for natural protection

S@@ en Gir@@ i was with the photos which he looked around , never satisfied . they were missing with po@@ or@@ ly positioned moti@@ ves and balanced colors .
the motiv@@ ated to carry him a camera and try to gra@@ b the situation .
then he was a child .
today , at the age of 28 , S@@ ans , Nept@@ une , ende@@ av@@ ed to bringing Nep@@ als to the international stage .
and his native place directly next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , it offers the perfect opportunity to shoot photos on Nep@@ als wildlife .
he described on Facebook as it helps to help him with his work :
I live at the edge of the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just wonder@@ ed at home , when I suddenly called Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) , he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river was a le@@ op@@ ard .
the river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort Sau@@ rah@@ a .
immediately I left with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the Leopard was found and I immediately began to kne@@ e images ! !
it is a collaboration with the authorities to obtain global recognition for Nep@@ al@@ as Nature and would like to understand the understanding of understanding that wild animals are not so fur@@ ious , as they look like .
and he should know it , because he had already made tig@@ ers on face to face :
a tiger can &apos;t hide from the opinion of the sheep in sleep ! !
late evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
I also was due to the darkness in the way home , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ he@@ ks appeared . he is immediately going on , we see and star@@ red me through the S@@ al @-@ Tre@@ es ! !
in order to promote the protection of wild animals , S@@ ans placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click on environmental protection ) on his photos .
but his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ as nature and wild animals is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and often lived in a tent to take up in Bar@@ dia National Park shots of Ot@@ ter . up to 12 days it lasted until he took a tiger , and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist information .
see below some of these photos .

years after the wedding , there were Indian women to pron@@ ounce names of their hus@@ bands
women in the small Indian village Gum@@ la Jam Gay@@ i in J@@ har@@ k@@ hand .

this post has been posted by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally based on Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers , an award winning international community organisation from India .
a revised version was re @-@ published here as part of a content Sh@@ aring Convention .
in many parts of India there are women with greatest care , the names of their hus@@ bands , or even from older men in the family .
instead , they use a p@@ onom@@ en or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ u@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra and Ut@@ t@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect the husband because of the social pressure of the husband , and the fear of consequences they should mis@@ use the norm , this practice in practice .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was sentenced from the Indian state of O@@ bo@@ a by a military court and cast off their family and the village community after having responded to a secret figure on behalf .
the tradition their wives also did not call on name , is also common among men . however , they are far from less assign@@ ments , if they all , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health staff as well as household women , a unique club and were therefore fast to the main discussions about the city .
it is a place just for them only to discuss the host@@ esses of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate and discuss .
as one of 56 clubs , which is in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community &apos;s video Vol@@ unte@@ ers and set itself for the degra@@ dation of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ine has been working for seven years with the help of their video camera to the discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s marriage to the Verb@@ ann@@ ess of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS In@@ fest@@ ed , and leads those se@@ p@@ ubs .
it reports about how this clubs created a safe place for those women and made them at the same time for ambass@@ adors of the wall .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed up in its discussions , did not name women who call their hus@@ bands in their names .
she decided for this subject , because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with whom the women can easily identify .
not according to the names of their hus@@ bands , a ro@@ ar is to be found guilty and never charged them in question .
Roh@@ ini believes :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman who resp@@ ects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who doesn &apos;t keep it , is watched as a woman without Mor@@ al .
the tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted , that we have never made up to this discussion round thoughts .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini wanted to have never seen her husband &apos;s name so far as it is running at home .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and mother in law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother in law and my husband were still long after the video had ended .
Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned back to me , saying , I should call him now on his name .
with this self @-@ confidence in Bag@@ gage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed that it was a good cause because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in Ut@@ t@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after video projection , the women tried to bring the discussion with a exercise in gear .
raw ini asked every participant in the name of her husband with various feelings - happy , anno@@ ying , lov@@ ingly , lov@@ ingly and so on .
then asked them all , &quot; If we are not able to tell us the names of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want us not respected ?
should it be equal to it ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when she brought the name of her hus@@ bands on her lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra over the breaking of a year @-@ old tradition , in which married women may never speak to their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so sh@@ y that during the whole exercise just before moving ; another decided to leave the entire fru@@ stration against him and his family by allowing it to curse him .
the expression on their faces was static .
I think I will never forget it .
even in the A@@ dr@@ en@@ al@@ in@@ let about that , with an ancient ro@@ asting , the women decided that they would actually try to call her husband to name their hus@@ bands .
and they kept their word .
in the next days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini , and asked what ideas put her in the head : his wife could not stop his name .
another Kl@@ ub@@ ic member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family .
when she had her mother in law she was afraid , she was afraid , and said that it was a mistake .
another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini meant that I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant in less under@@ stand@@ still and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
Roh@@ ini reported how women attempted to stop other practices , such as the Tra@@ ction of the red point at the fore@@ head , which shows the Eh@@ est@@ atus :
why do only women have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband , I would bear the least red point when he did it .
he laugh@@ ed only and I heard it , to bear him .
the other women have not completely ceased , but mine , they are now in a better position , even to choose it in some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; we make a tour with every discussion .
normally we packed lunch and water and go out into the field .
I don &apos;t want to make sure that women could make , who could hear , &quot; says she .
during the last months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days in their life with cakes . they d@@ anced , sang and talking about things that they had never had sex before .
raw ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years , but I also have talking about some things , for example how our ident@@ ities are associated to our hus@@ bands , never said so hon@@ est .
it feels great to say certain things loud , no matter how small they occur one .
in a discussion round , we have talking about the concept of honour and how it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have borne only Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most of them is okay , but some of them wanted a sal@@ es@@ c@@ ta , a large shirt over a tro@@ users , they have not taken .
after a lot of stri@@ fe and discussion about the advantages of the own h@@ anger , the mor@@ als connected to the Sar@@ is and much more , decor@@ ate Roh@@ ini her own pair of cur@@ t@@ as ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a discussion round , so that women could carry them .
next , they have now decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear Je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure that they can create it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the question whether in the five months since their first discussion club has already changed something , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly coming into rolls : &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far we have done just little steps .
some women tried it a couple of times , but they list@@ ened to say the name of her husband .
some , me included , do it yet , but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved .
only one or two will continue to do the names of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women have now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their fore@@ head .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to reach in their lives - like the line of movement or the own h@@ anger selection - at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
in order to give yourself mutual confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a sacrifice of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am it too .
but this club gives everyone of us the confidence that will change something .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction , if every woman goes home after home and other people , what we speak , and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

on the 29th of June this year the h@@ ash@@ tag in the top of the year ( Beatles Memorial ) was found in the Japanese Twitter trend , with many fans of memories and their appreci@@ ation for the Beatles .
the visit of the Beatles in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a swe@@ aring in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who had exclusively inter@@ viewed in London in 1964 , noted on the 50th anniversary of the first visit :
for just under five days , the Beatles have been in the country , but this has been sufficient to turn the Japanese .
the people here is quite quickly became clear that they had no other choice when the Beatles received open arms .
many famous Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than just a universal language like English &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; telling Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retail book Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good morning ! the day is the Beatles Memorial Day in Japan . in the age of 51 they were here in Tokyo .
even today , songs from the Beatles in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in the English classes are sung in Japanese medium schools .
the Kit@@ sch of the Beatles survived everything .
today &apos;s Beatles is commem@@ oration .
we all love the Beatles in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; -@@ doll John Lenn@@ on should display or not .
and how it belongs to fans , Japanese can also make pilgrimage to the well @-@ known locations that are related to the band .
here . if you love the Beatles , you &apos;ll need to visit the 5 locations that you have to visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Ma@@ thew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fields ( Memorial in New York )
4 ) Penn@@ y Lane
5 ) ( From the link ) The Beatles Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
sometimes you can &apos;t be sk@@ ur@@ ril enough :
good morning together .
today &apos;s Beatles is commem@@ oration .
exactly today in 1966 the Beatles came to Japan .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! made on a pilgrimage to London and ran across the Abbey Road .
we did the same year last year .
and of course , some companies use the fan community as well as for example this R@@ amen shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese pasta ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ ah@@ iro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen !
and what could this be for a day ?
I will listen to me today &quot; Y@@ ES@@ TER@@ DA@@ Y &quot; today and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les with Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya .

so , we hope you are !

a new system of kidn@@ apping persons for the organisation , probably for super@@ inten@@ tional purposes , probably for super@@ st@@ itious purposes , be@@ ati@@ fied the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambi@@ que . the local government now called a number of operations into life to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was be@@ headed and part of the organs were taken from .
two men were arrested and put them in the wake that the organs of Sh@@ aman in Tanzania and Malawi are used .
it grant the local super@@ st@@ ition that the head of a sp@@ aw@@ ning man gold contains ancient or wealth , the police custody of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia of the BBC .
it is the first time that consecutive attacks were registered in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
another group , the goal of ex@@ h@@ ort@@ ation for ob@@ sc@@ ure is people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the UN 2016 to study a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government campaigns to fight these super@@ st@@ ition and pre@@ conception .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .

attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Moz@@ ambi@@ que are the destination of rit@@ ual attacks , war@@ ned the Mos@@ ambi@@ que Police to the latest ex@@ h@@ ort@@ ation of three gl@@ itter@@ ing men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the ex@@ h@@ ort@@ ation took place .
H@@ uss@@ ene Al@@ gy Ad@@ amo , Student and residents of the City of In@@ ham@@ ism in the South of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , said that the local police already said :
PR@@ M believes that the Sh@@ am@@ ans are involved in the death of a high @-@ person men .
the persecution and killing of glasses in the district of Mor@@ gre@@ bal@@ a , province of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , for probably super@@ st@@ itious rit@@ u@@ als , has announced cultural moti@@ fs and is considering the police of the Republic of Moz@@ ambi@@ que ( PR@@ M ) , which also suggests that a faith existed , according to the victims in the head , the wealth of wealth .
in the last days , three men were murdered with hair@@ style problems in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Sam@@ an@@ tha distributed the chron@@ icles of the blo@@ g@@ gers poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who noted that the problem is part of the larger social difficulty of which Moz@@ ambi@@ que is opposite :
I would like to attend E@@ IN Mos@@ ambi@@ que , DAS S@@ ICH , when they would like to provide sex with good notes , work and other achievements , a nation where the teacher would come to earn or even their life to des@@ erve their bread , a country in which the al@@ bin@@ os still k@@ ah@@ le or &quot; black magic &quot; are ch@@ ased to get to quick wealth .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published in the context of a partnership agreement with Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of pris@@ oned Chinese dis@@ sidents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has drawn attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized for liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state risk ) after he calls for the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o which claims the democratic re@@ forms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a nar@@ rator , he told it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China still receives views from the international community , Nobel Prize @-@ Lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , Di@@ chter@@ in Li@@ u X@@ ia , to allow for a treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ized the strict treatment of the Pa@@ ares in Beijing , others are completely destroyed .
Hong Kong Free Press has summarized some reaction from abroad .
United Nations
Z@@ eid R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment if the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Li@@ u to make a treatment abroad .
Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ø@@ r@@ ge Br@@ ings have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway came into stores after the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government had ceased that this ultimately has nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were only continued in December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to restore the salmon travels to China , since the exports have been largely blocked since 2010 .
after the message had spread that Li@@ u was seriously injured , the Nobel Committee brought his hope to an un@@ conditional release of expression and invited Li@@ u to catch his prize in Oslo .
due to his detention , he was not able to meet his price .
Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair during the ceremony .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision on which China was asked to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from the house arrest and to allow himself to search for medical support , where he wants .
the top establishment of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini called for China to release Li@@ us , as she divided in an explanation on June 30 :
we wait at the same time that China lifts all restrictions of Lord Li@@ us wives as well as family members .
they shall meet all the visits and receive them who wish to communicate and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
USA
U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad divided that Americans have &quot; him that he has the opportunity for the treatment abroad , if it is advis@@ able to help him in his satisfaction . &quot;
a spokes@@ person in the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the message AF@@ P on the 27th of June that the embassy was sending the Chinese authorities to make free only Li@@ u , but also his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from their house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the rec@@ ess of the US Embassy moved to China , with the exterior of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , with the exterior of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no land have the right to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley divided that China should offer the following :
protection and freedom , such as travel clarity and access to the medical care of his choice , which they are entitled to the Chinese constitution and legal system and international obligations .
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz also introduced a decision in the Congress to allow the Chinese government to push on it , Li@@ u and his wife un@@ conditi@@ onally free .
I need to ask China to allow Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ conditi@@ onally , so that he may know in a proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
on July 3 , Berlin , Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote that Li@@ u gets all the medical support that it needs &quot; and that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing of the News Agency Reuters that China had great concerns about whether the verteb@@ ra@@ e could over@@ look at Li@@ u in Hamburg .
Canada
on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um , asked China to provide a reasonable medical care and to give it the opportunity to move from his family .
Li@@ us lawyer told AF@@ P previously , that Li@@ us Mrs. , Li@@ u X@@ ia could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in hospital , and that it is not permitted to talk with someone outside , including his lawyers , to talk and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um nar@@ rates :
Canada calls China to adopt its international human rights violations , including freedom of expression to maintain and allow for the exercise of these rights .
France
France &apos;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs referred to China in a declaration on June 29 , to Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has received all treatments which he needs , regardless where , needs . in addition , his wife and his family must have contact with him .
though the news of the news information already reported that the French government of Li@@ u was welcome in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there are no further information that France would eventually take him .
Taiwan
the Council of the land@@ lor@@ ds in Taiwan called for China on June 27 , to Li@@ u , allowing a greater tolerance towards those who require peaceful funds to request political re@@ forms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ature Yu Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u passed by the reg@@ ression of the Democratic Pro@@ gress Party in China to allow to treat the sick intellectual property of Taiwan in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed herself in a declaration on June 28th for Li@@ u , and gave that many him have asked him to pray for Li@@ us Wel@@ fare .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that he had taken and had been un@@ punished for which he had been un@@ punished , more stable and we@@ al@@ thy China had helped to have contributed to a peaceful world .
I felt personally moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tu@@ als and affected people are inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the charter 08 signed , which stands for democracy , freedom and law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may be stup@@ id , since Singapore has been recognized as an independent state as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , Singapore was considered to be considered a city .
this re@@ mark triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the State Association of State of New York , the Minister , that many people critic@@ ized the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared to Singapore with other countries .
he under@@ support that Singapore should be considered city .
... no one has put in question whether New York is a democracy ...
that is , whereby most people go a mistake .
I tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; to turn the logic , &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore .
and then , after all our efforts and offerings to create this valuable country , we hear that we are no country .
it was so vul@@ gar , it had the certificate of a escape prior to the responsibilities , a mandatory we@@ ather@@ proof .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it ?
the reasons mentioned by Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am were not very Nobel : he def@@ ended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of which he appeared in@@ sof@@ ten .
however , on the other hand , he def@@ ended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally among those cities that are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core point of the Th@@ as , again the good old bodies of the author@@ itarian fe@@ as@@ ers will be back to be able to leave the demo@@ c@@ ased logic , because it fits better to their power .
in the final week of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am the last week of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am was given answers to his American guests in our press , our J@@ udi@@ c@@ ative , our political system really not @-@ answers .
relevant issues clo@@ aked with non @-@ answers .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am on his opinion , since they didn &apos;t understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city is in which country belongs to our city ...
short , I understand nothing .
I would be very grat@@ eful if our new K Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am would take the effort to clari@@ fy this point , if it was highly paid to be part of the government of Singapore .
by clicking on the blog his comment , he tells about the critics that you should start to read the entire co @-@ copy of the conference , so that you could understand the context of statements by Sh@@ an@@ ug@@ am better , according to which Singapore is a city and no country .
read the script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore would be so un@@ easy , even if we are looking for free and just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he enjoys Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party win for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not a land , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he doesn &apos;t know it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows its dis@@ appointment over Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , who makes an increasing generation , such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I have said about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said , ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de that awaits me - whether I agree with them or not , but this is a different thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore , I have doub@@ ts and I am not even sure whether he really believes , really associated and being aware of what he def@@ ended .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review de@@ compos@@ es the weak@@ nesses of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am Arg@@ uments :
did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am has committed an error , or was there an Fre@@ ud@@ scher reference ?
if Singapore is not a country , we only considered independent and sover@@ eign state ?
but if not , on which country the sover@@ eign rights of the city of Singapore are back ?
Singapore is unique , it is both country and city .
since he plays an important role within the government of government , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am are of serious significance .
why do they have their military service to defend their military service , but they do not defend their country ?
who must pay our prime minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink Person@@ alize ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
, ten@@ ding the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade for the reference , Singapore and was always a city :
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this sentence seems to have many Singap@@ ore@@ an injured ...
no one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we were always a city / island state .
I can understand that we often hear talking about &quot; the defense of the country in particular &quot; etc . , but that &apos;s not quite true .
we should talk about the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; net@@ tes Canadian &quot;
Canadian N@@ ed Flanders .
screenshot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked short Ed@@ itors : what is the most miss@@ able aspect at your home or home country ?
their answers are published here as part of a continuous series , with rum@@ ors over certain parts of the world uncovered and another fac@@ et should be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ is Thom@@ pson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question that is set to me in Japan is : &quot; are you American ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , do you harm me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I live in Canada since 1994 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation in which situation the conversation is taking place , it is considered cour@@ te@@ ous to show interest in its talk partner by making personal questions .
then , on my clari@@ fication then the standard response : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . many Canadian men may cook inn@@ ed before W@@ ut if they are kept for Americans , but don &apos;t distur@@ b me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Canadian Americans by Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many can@@ als make a Canadian flag well visible on their back@@ pack if they travel .
all love can@@ als .
Americans on the other ... .
so it was , when I started 20 years ago through the world - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before the 11th September .
Canadian players have already borne small ap@@ hor@@ n@@ als in their baggage to distingu@@ ish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
there is no weapons with us !
the same sex@@ es have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think Canada is so great .
we are cour@@ te@@ ous .
we say obviously very often &quot; exc@@ use . &quot;
Canada also applies to ethnic groups compared to ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we are Canadian , nice .
I hate that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have many American friends I ad@@ mi@@ red a lot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would not make me nothing , if you would change Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; first : as &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means to be careful , gentle , gentle , gentle , but trag@@ ically important figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sim@@ p@@ sons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( which has a very own Canadian Doppel@@ gän@@ ger ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Canada really is a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , this would be a step forward . but the real problem exists , that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there is no corners and edges , nothing on which one can stum@@ ble .
harm@@ less , is un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting to earn and not to earn attention .
this may be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far from the things that happen around one .
I would even go to say that the wish to be free and alone to be a master of the Canadian .
we tend to worry about our own affairs .
what exceptional @-@ standing as &quot; nice &quot; draw , is perhaps just cool courtesy .
Canadian people don &apos;t talk about the fence with the neigh@@ bors .
we lack the warm , open kindness , which I connect to my American friends now .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then Just@@ in Tru@@ de@@ au entered the stage to show that Canadian more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada to sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ odi@@ ert in Thailand Jun@@ ta
one in Thailand famous pop @-@ band has released a music video that the Jun@@ ta par@@ odi@@ ert , which took power in 2014 and re@@ igns in spite of their promises to restore the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man that tells about it what is doing his gir@@ l@@ friend .
although not expressly polit@@ ically , the music video refers to the sustained military dom@@ ination of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other websites for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video for song was a huge success .
within the first three days , the video was divided into Facebook 1.@@ 254 times and received 8.@@ 800 Li@@ kes on Facebook .
last month the Charlie @-@ Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; Der dict@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activ@@ ist the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and enter@@ taining introduction to Thai politics , in@@ particular as it keeps the situation in the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
check out these recordings of the video that relate to some of the political themes , which have persecuted Thailand in the past three years .
the &quot; 44 rules of the girl &quot; might refer to the dra@@ con@@ ical section 44 of the preliminary constitution , which is the commander in Chief of the He@@ eres absolute decision on important national topics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; installation change &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are considered critics by the Jun@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the Act on computer crimin@@ ality , whose v@@ age and un@@ clear rules often have to be explo@@ ited by the authorities to conv@@ ene activ@@ ist and other critics of the state .
for this purpose a new unit in the army was established , the online content is monitored and individuals who accused of having been accused of prosec@@ uted the monarchy .

one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta has continued to purchase its decision to buy the sub@@ ters of U @-@ boats , although security experts had war@@ ned that the purchase is un@@ necessary and a waste of tax ev@@ asion .
in the video it is even shown as people are thrown into a black delivery van before you bring them into an inter@@ change camp , another problem .
some journalists are sitting in prison , because they supp@@ os@@ edly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in the society and to use the Internet users , they should re@@ inv@@ ent the monarchy .
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs of the band formed the Sal@@ ut from &quot; Die Tri@@ bute by Pan@@ em &quot; during the protests in 2014 .

the following article written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ y@@ no@@ v , first published on the website of OC Media , and is published here with friendly permission .
the post @-@ war company recovered only slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has been over 20 years now , since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ch@@ as@@ ian war officially ended , but his fol@@ ds are still visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of northern district at T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show distinctive pictures .
villages like D@@ zh@@ an@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the hydro@@ carb@@ ons of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , de@@ as@@ ies , Geor@@ gi@@ er and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today the largest part of Russians and Ab@@ ch@@ marks are living in the area .
such settlements are also called spirits in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these spirits .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of 16.000 people had barely increased after one decade .
in 1989 about 43@@ ,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; this is a result of the war &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey building blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60 &apos;s , are symbo@@ lically marked for the decline and destruction of the region .
the buildings are fallen and very rare they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village of D@@ zh@@ an@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts a conversation and it falls difficult to stop this .
&quot; this is a result of the war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk with you ? &quot; why do I speak ?
it is still clear . &quot;
the war was full of life before the war .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , which served all the community .
now there is only paved road with twi@@ sts spl@@ end@@ our buildings .
people who once lived on this place and their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have left the district now .
about fifty inhabitants live in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ zh@@ an@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks like .
the Ch@@ ru@@ sch@@ osh@@ enk@@ kas , which can accommodate one or two families , can be attached to the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look at the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they go back immediately .
&quot; our Mother has forbidden us to photograph us , &quot; says one of the girl .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she just banned us , that is all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ per@@ ed to her gir@@ l@@ friend and suddenly leave the destroyed buildings and disappear .
many people work in the area for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ ug@@ ol .
families are also involved in sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for own supplies ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetables .
it is difficult over the lap .
in winter , the district management provides for free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cchini &quot;
about ten years ago , an old woman with the name Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ em , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to jung@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite their oldest subsidiary , who lives in France , did not leave Gal@@ ina in front of Ab@@ ch@@ asia , to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asia . &quot;
Gal@@ ina wants to accept no financial aid from her daughter and wait to support her young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly r@@ ente is just nine US dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a sweet garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ em tells us that they and other vill@@ agers are trying to meet regularly and holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
when holidays are , we visit us .
but we can not do that - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; calls the a@@ unt G@@ em to her . &quot; they said , we could build zu@@ cchini .
I have already prepared the floor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cchini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as conversation partner in Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day they are remin@@ is@@ cent of the village before the war .
despite the relatives , who live in central rus@@ sia , Oss@@ et@@ ia and Georgia ( the country Ab@@ ch@@ asia broke off ) , they had not had the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; we recently bought country in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative Capital in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) .
we want to build a house there , but this will last some , &quot; explains them . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha is awarded for every child about $ 9 child money .
her husband works in the Kohl@@ eng@@ ru@@ be .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ ascha kinder@@ gart@@ ens was once found , they keep pigs , cows , du@@ cks and h@@ ens .
she tells us that it was first a very anxi@@ ous situation when many people left the village after the war .
but during the time she lost her fears .

&quot; we have no fear of the dark street or the few people .
you can get to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has something to do with cookies .
after the war there was scar@@ cely work and all lived like it was right .
I remember every day as the city and the war were once . &quot;
when our talk about the end , a little boy is over to us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy before him .
he plays with the ball that fell down the hill .
a group of children pursu@@ es the ball .
while they run , some of them cast stones upon the falling buildings .
these ruins are a part of their childhood which provide for in@@ justice in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it differently .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants on their long journey
Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , near Mexico City .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our Partners PR@@ I.@@ org and is published here with friendly permission .
on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America will be certain places for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
it is directed by a 59@@ - year old Mexican woman , a small woman with a cor@@ als of a cor@@ als of pink quartz frame and gold colored ear@@ ring in t@@ ed@@ dy form .
she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born there in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this top name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a goal for Afri@@ kaner and Ha@@ iti@@ ans who are on the journey .
the hotel has no charm .
for around 2,50 Dollar the night sleep in simple rooms , with grinding , cr@@ um@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Haiti mig@@ rants come here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is telling the people in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast to call them : &quot; m@@ om Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
at the moment it &apos;s rather quiet but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept outside on cart@@ ons .
she does not want to re@@ ject it .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick , they bought these medicines that they cannot pay them , they mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ sam e@@ ager@@ ly exhau@@ sted from the long voyage .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebast@@ i@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived at short time ago .
I asked him if Mama Africa is an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebast@@ i@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a Jo@@ gh@@ urt@@ le ) po@@ sia with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , he answered with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that there are very nice women in African women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very well here . &quot;
Sebast@@ i@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to come to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they already lived in Brazil , however , it is for some Afri@@ cans , who are on the way into the United States , normally a first stop in South America and go to the north .
the family had heard from other sign@@ posts of Mama Africa . &quot; m@@ om Africa is a well @-@ known name on the route , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells us that the Ha@@ iti@@ ans and Afri@@ kaner often travel together the route and that the Afri@@ cans were already talking to W@@ hat@@ s@@ App by Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
as many of its sign@@ posts , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a building workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the football World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started its journey into the United States .
he has been a guest in Mama Africa for months : it sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to get the Bust@@ ick@@ et to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he is in contact with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; m@@ om Africa is our Mother and we never leave it again , &quot; says he sm@@ iling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells us that her guests have often send text messages when they went to gr@@ ate them or to report about the course of their journey .
it explains that her Christian faith is the drive of their work .
they don &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have brought her to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known , but it is not the only spar@@ ity hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city , a S@@ ack@@ g@@ asse leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter is Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family immig@@ rants from their little house .
he is polic@@ emen and has found that Bust@@ ick@@ ets are sold to numerous African migrants .
he began to help them to receive a reasonable price , he offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment , there are 25 people , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans .
some sleeping on ceilings on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking area outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela declares that he knows what the guests make .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; says . &quot; I have experienced what they experience .
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was transferred to the United States after a raid on his work .
the majority of migrants who travels across Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other residents open the doors of their houses for them .
José Antonio C@@ ord@@ ova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children before men who wanted to kill him without a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for a accommodation and a well @-@ known , a hon@@ our@@ ing , has offered him roof .
a few months later the family lives there and they try to decide where the next steps should go .
back to the house of Mama Africa is all again full of guests .
in the ais@@ les , the trav@@ eller are quiet their teleph@@ ones .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a majority from Somalia .
Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy about that her house is full , but she is nost@@ al@@ g@@ ically , because of those who have gone .
like a proud grand@@ mother she sh@@ aken her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair b@@ ays that you made a sp@@ ine , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laugh@@ s sad , while she sum@@ med them shortly .
&quot; Ya is fu@@ cking , &quot; repeated every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install monitoring app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication tools in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter users of the Steel Station .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in the west of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on 10 July , the mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile phone that shows the District government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will have access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities decided to use the app for more than fight against terrorism .
according to a exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture , because she had installed the app after they had replaced the app with a private we@@ chat group .
in the notification of the police , the app will determine the sources and the distribution routes of the terror@@ ists and persec@@ ute , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information , &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs Website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service performance with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elecom .
the main function is the blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , by online gu@@ ins , Tro@@ ians and Ph@@ ishing pages to make user attention to how much time they spend online , and to control the own home network .
this app includes fil@@ tering for min@@ ors to help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can naturally be used in a wide range of course .
for example , the &quot; remote actors &quot; state actors or even h@@ ack@@ er@@ able to manipul@@ ate the home network of one person to manipul@@ ate or out of it .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while announ@@ cements on digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China often focus on the experience of users in the bigger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote , op@@ ted ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , authorities often arrange extreme c@@ ens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ in@@ ely Internet access .
this based on Twitter based Media Out@@ let &quot; Images from Mountain China &quot; ( Germany ) , the cen@@ sored news published in China , showed photos from a Check@@ point , on the polic@@ emen who would un@@ checked the inhabitants without any monitoring app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are discovered using a Check@@ point with a device without these software , they could be imprisoned up to 10 days .
this is a blow for the technological development .
they have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by the recovery technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from the city of China &quot; ( Germany ) , also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can raise the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus gets restricted access to the hard disk of the computer .
after installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and cell@@ phone in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang are available in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang .
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang are possibly a reaction to the instructions of the town @-@ party Council to minim@@ ize the dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal contents .
all government agencies , authorities and related facilities including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the Direc@@ tion of the Cyber@@ security Office for operation of their computer and communication equipment .
a recent report by Freedom House , an American Human Rights Organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang published the authorities on June 27 in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , a regulation related to all residents and entrepren@@ eurs , up to 1 August their &quot; personal ID cards , phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ eb@@ ooks and media storage cards &quot; to register by local police .
however , the intention is evident any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; to identify and destroy this promotion , however , the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is is three million inhabitants , giving them pen@@ alties for a whole range of other possible clubs , including such that relate to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death

this is the first of six reports in row &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane has taken his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far from our blue , virtual world you look at and stell@@ ar that you &apos;re all alone on a place where everything is gone missing .
everything has dis@@ band@@ ed and dis@@ solves and revealed a truth that is clearly visible , both from inside as well as outside .
one who makes her name all the glory .
one who has put down in a list of poultry and express the no met@@ aph@@ one .
but when you bring back the reality and bring behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the actors - turn the characters in beings from flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death .
all the doub@@ ts are in smoke , and you shall be aware of your existence , even if the earth is per@@ ver@@ ted on the axis of the accident . it is clear that you are caught here between the walls , your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone for stone .
they have arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough to bear my lesson , as the Chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure .
he presented his power over us by giving even the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts that we knew .
five young people were killed during a peaceful protests like un@@ we@@ eds in the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough to remove the town the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; -@@ Schrei@@ er .
all of the city was cov@@ eted , just my own .
for the first time it was still silent , for the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a town , which is up to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their compli@@ ments .
in the third night the things had stopped , after the power supply had ceased in the quarter .
I broke the silence , having cried several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice due to silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt good enough to gather together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we have led us to a splendid picture that met my expectations full and fulfilled .
in such a moment you know that you are free the spirit from the lamp , but it is just interested in the od@@ our .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Make you ready to meet us at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey may you enter - nothing can return your voice , after you have failed to give you the whole way up to the office of security service from the body .
I arrived there .
Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I was now .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak : &quot; let me hear , as you are &apos; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar , or you are only b@@ old enough to cry if we are not near . &quot;
his h@@ iller filled their eyes to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you will tell you what to look in the eyes and not to the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did , did nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I stood before this building .
perhaps it was in my fol@@ ly , vanity ; perhaps on the revolution .
I was so sure when I answered : &quot; I wouldn &apos;t have thought that you have already forgotten my voice since yesterday .
and I think I never heard you would have to look at your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest conversation , which could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regre@@ t the word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does him in detail and his father immediately with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his father immediately with it . &quot;
the Stri@@ ank of this curse is to me until today in the nose .
he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a female torture that I was suspended for months .
I cried out the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
after that , through the court and into the second office , which leads through one speed to the individual cells .
I saw all details exactly one before I support the room .
differently , otherwise it was allocated to me a larger cell .
I have to share them with only one another prisoners and may immediately set me without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the officials left the cell , and I handle on an old communication method : with the f@@ ist against the wall .
I learned that my cell com@@ ra@@ de was a &quot; Er@@ sth@@ ain@@ ling . &quot;
after long public@@ ans he answered me .
apparently in no one of the surrounding cells was a respected male age that looks similar to me and called &apos; The doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness , there are no markings face , and doctors are not available here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; perhaps someone , whose voice sounds like my sounds ? &quot;
all answers communic@@ ates its existence .
perhaps he was re@@ located to one of the large cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had covered me , they would be joy@@ ful when I live .
Lü@@ g@@ ner .
I would like to have had a bird @-@ like to drive all these c@@ els , who lab@@ elled to the fruit in the garden of my head lab@@ s .
from the distance I don &apos;t listen to &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; out of the distance .
it must be at 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time , the cri@@ es , every day .
the door opens .
I always convinced that black the colour of the Ver@@ der@@ son , until I saw the yellow light , which gave us the barbecue in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Donn@@ er , &quot; play on the 13th S@@ ure of Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; they are here to be heard . &quot;
this was the secret revealed : to protect the state security before us and prevent the tra@@ itors and the terror@@ ists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wit@@ ic dial@@ ect - thus they played their conc@@ ession@@ aire map and ri@@ ver@@ ted the close view of its world view .
this is not a house that is here is not a country ; it is a curse that they call body @-@ exist@@ ent to transform the crimin@@ als of their sound into a hero .
I support the audi@@ ble and meet at Abu I@@ mad , a sl@@ ender and com@@ mitt@@ edly man ; at least he comes to me so .
he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the fac@@ ial expres@@ sions that you &apos;re still young , you can join it so much Wi@@ ch@@ ti@@ ger@@ es with your life than you to protest this day and to protest demonstrations , who will soon find an end soon . &quot;
I did not answered .
I &apos;m acc@@ ust@@ omed to answer it , not to answer .
I really can &apos;t say more precisely when insul@@ ating and stro@@ kes in a friendly talk about me became a common communication remedy .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
any voice in me said that I had to deny me or bad about it , though I had done nothing to make this sentence .
in all its diversity .
his command is to pl@@ uck me as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls his loving &quot; conf@@ ession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably dates from the clo@@ ak .
your father p@@ age@@ ously to your cry .
give him the pleasure , you can not measure you with him , and you can &apos;t keep your cri@@ es .
my excav@@ ations made him not enough , so they made the pipe through a cable .
in my first arrest , I asked if the investig@@ ator had worked earlier times as a gar@@ bage working or whether this was the normal working room .
they had four cables attached to each other to present us from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable .
within a single hour , three of them changed from them while I was still in the row .
I had lost every feeling in my body - and also my voice , so I heard that I heard .
the be@@ eke@@ eper noted the cooling and found no pleasure in it , so it is why the next one has to handle an electrically charged rod .
electricity flow through all the body , enough to supply my whole quarter .
my semi@@ bare body , which was stretched out on the ground , was the perfect power conductor .
the divers disappeared and the pain was again there .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
that must have been around midnight .
I decided to lay me back again ; say we , that was my only option .
some hours passed , which came to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning bet .
the door opens and the morning light is filled with the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
I am answering the voice of an exhau@@ sted young people : &quot; my lord , my father must make terrible wor@@ ried . &quot;
&quot; be quiet , and walk , thou shalt be moved . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always been released .
where do they lead me ? !

with his music , often dealt with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian poultry , but also calls for the core of the entire Arab world . all these topics are not only in its hom@@ etown of Am@@ man relev@@ ance , but also in cities which are from Damascus to the whole of San@@ aa in Yemen .
at the age of 25 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees itself as a man who is not restricted by borders , and he can bring with people under the devastating consequences of foreign inter@@ ventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Yemen and Libya .
even if it does not open it , he swe@@ pt up against the US @-@ American foreign policy .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war areas , some of what was born in war areas - so he himself signi@@ fies himself , even if he was born in Jordan , and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; I don &apos;t think of my own life stands , &quot; st@@ resses H@@ d@@ ai@@ b .
then he adds : &quot; I think that I am a man , while he was dissolved in water in two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ ad@@ an ; in this time it is intended for Muslims , from sunrise until sunset .
the Jord@@ anian law says that the public consumption of food is illegal during the Ram@@ ad@@ an illeg@@ ally .
apparently , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weak@@ nesses to break with ancient traditions . on the other hand , a cup of coffee is to do little with protest against Islam .
basically , the sle@@ ek shows delicious coffee and s@@ quad@@ ron of the k@@ ent cigarette in the nose to the first line of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the free sky , especially when you cast a look into the neighboring countries .
it is therefore simple to do basic things - how to drink in the public during Ram@@ ad@@ an water - to finish in the prison .
recently , the Interior Ministry of Jordan was cancelled a gig of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , already for the second time .
some Parliament ordered that support the Islamic action against the Muslim Brotherhood - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ osexual Fron@@ ti@@ ers Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country contra@@ di@@ ct and the main reason for the Concert table .
the MP and former press spokes@@ woman of the Islamic Coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; just &quot; because of sexual orientation of the prison was cancelled .
many claim in addition to the commitment of the band in affairs like the Arab spring , human rights and free expression in the Arab world is more dangerous acti@@ vis@@ m , which represents the old legitim@@ acy of authorised legitim@@ acy reg@@ imes in the entire region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a estimates the j@@ ord@@ an people as &quot; progressive support of human rights &quot; which continued to use &quot; for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement is probably not easy to be conf@@ used Rh@@ et@@ or@@ k , but actually a clear cryst@@ all@@ ine reality reflected in Jordan , which occurs in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs plant .
in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b traditional gender standards came to body by giving his vision of the fate of Arabic women who have vo@@ re@@ lie@@ ve sex .
the picture shows the sk@@ el@@ eton of a obviously low @-@ known woman whose arms and legs are spread up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red sea ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who actually should trust .
in Jordan the number of &apos; Hon@@ mor@@ ing &apos; increased in Jordan - the in@@ official outside .
human Rights Watch according to its cli@@ max in 2016 , the number of Hon@@ or in 2016 reached its peak ; however , Jordan is still missing in order to support women who tried Mor@@ des or domestic violence to support reasonable manner .
according to a law to un@@ interrup@@ tions from 1954 , women who are subject to in@@ corporate violence , &quot; to un@@ certain time in jail , &quot; and for their release is often a years of un@@ bureau@@ cr@@ atic effort as well as the guarantee provided by the family that the woman is done nothing .
even H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs Music is pleased to announce great popularity and is well known to tra@@ des@@ men that are in his country long as tab@@ oo .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b den@@ ying that his work is polit@@ ically , of course , however , that he is his music , the full exp@@ ir@@ relevant announ@@ cements on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , is not able to separate politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been declared policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song named &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question after the Palestinian identity in attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the focus on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs that are polit@@ ically active in the core .
in March 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b released a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
in the course of the songs H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind market , in which you can get to what you want , &quot; it is faith or not believe , h@@ etero@@ gen@@ ome or homosexu@@ ality .
he not@@ ices that any one speaks in Jordan about the rights of g@@ ay and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments about the equality of L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + -@@ individu@@ en still have been cen@@ sored in 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b conducted an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an online programme Ro@@ ya , in order to realize that his comments from the context , revol@@ ves and in his opinion .
&quot; on Youtube it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but it was only a modified version , &quot; says he .
today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b advert@@ ises the Arab L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that Int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance did not promise to Islam .
he mentioned Abu nu@@ de , a poet of the eighth century , still remained in memory thanks to its hom@@ o@@ otic poems .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ de should work once again on behalf of the Cali@@ ph , in the eighth century it could be open over homosexu@@ ality , why can Jord@@ i not this ?
the real problem , such as H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ic kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks on the free expression of opinion , and that progressive voices can be brought to silence .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian news service provided several former government members and members of the teaching association , with the reasons that they had been critic@@ ized on comments in social media to impos@@ e corruption associated with deeply in the country .
in view of its , the H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs show is only the top of the ice@@ berg - the real challenge is to work with structural changes in the next generation of Jord@@ i .
for him , progress is a permanent type and take away . Jordan has stopped for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - it looks like H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - consists of slow , need and internal changes . it is sure that these changes from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
ultimately , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arab@@ s also , from an Arab world without inter@@ ventions from abroad .
he will not only dreams about his work until Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience &quot; them . &quot;
perhaps the region is aimed at the help of music , art and literature of a real and fundamental op@@ enn@@ ess , and not by bombs , stre@@ aks and on artificial species of the demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least , he hopes it .
until it is possible , h@@ d@@ ai@@ b is going to pass through and therefore also resist resistance .
this report was made by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Reporting , which A@@ man belongs to A@@ man as a student Fel@@ low .
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
these great , ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ ant war@@ fare , are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous the@@ ories as regards the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
it is assumed that it is a version of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually aged in August in many opponents that were also over a thousand years and come from a time , in the troops from the West Japan to the nor@@ theastern region to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ ishi to conquer the kne@@ e .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to gra@@ b a few great seats , that &apos;s why we have a great view .
you can only imagine how big these parts are ...
a common centre in the capital city , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organised a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( lit@@ t@@ l .
I &apos;m looking for the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en since long time : two fixed cars are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , Neb@@ uta &apos;s festival will take the only true truth - and to spend a breathtaking way in summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the North of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 @-@ meter high car was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely were outer appearance and body care as important as in this story , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth from crimin@@ ality and to promote a legitim@@ ate profession as to the Fr@@ ise@@ dec .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historical center of Lima , the capital of Lima , with a very high crime rate , where roads and illegal drugs are everyday .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region are not safe .
at the same time Peru - how many other Central and South American countries - rising demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and the unusual hair@@ s of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ ym@@ ar ( Peru ) , has led to that more than normal citizens in the experienced hands of hair@@ dresser , which can be found in the hair@@ style hair@@ style .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ s , which go to the ou@@ ter@@ most bound@@ aries of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event that will take place in the hair@@ dresser &apos;s competition &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os &quot; competition since 2014 .
there are experts from each other to show you who can create the ec@@ cent@@ ric le@@ ooks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos to current competitions there is on the public Facebook Profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who is located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to celebrate their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools , and instead of poor advice regarding training in hair@@ style , which makes it possible to find work .
motiv@@ ating from this activity and the opportunity to have dozens of yo@@ ungst@@ ers have seen that they can take a job , currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the beginning of March , and reported on some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only specialist school in the municipality and the district of which we are very proud , because of love for the children , we have built this educational community .
Columbia : love letters to Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ fighters

use with kind permission .
the following article is the modified version of the Beit@@ ra@@ gs &quot; Liebes@@ Message to Gu@@ er@@ illed war@@ ders , &quot; which has published international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
this post is published here in the context of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people who we know ?
is it not yet more important , people who feel out@@ going to hold aff@@ ection ?
exactly this question was the two young Colom@@ bian activists of Leonardo P@@ á@@ r@@ ra@@ ga by the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Crist@@ ian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign cart@@ as p@@ or la Re@@ conc@@ ili@@ aci@@ ón ( letters to reconciliation ) , who encourage young people to write Gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
only recently , their country was the place of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part : after many long negotiations the Colom@@ bian government had closed a peace treaty with the Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ a@@ Movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ) , which forms the end of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
International was considered as important that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel Santos offered the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its for the Nobel Peace Prize .
however , in front of the column there is a long way until you can speak of a true reconciliation and peace .
gu@@ err@@ illa , who lived for many years in illegal camps , were exposed to a war rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic and carried out around the clock their weapons with themselves , to integrate into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , again , who had used the life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hat@@ red against Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ fighters , these must now take into their ranks , and support them to build a new life .
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian were convinced that the young colum@@ n@@ ans have to close together and help at the integration process .
and just this they did : until now , thousands of young people have written letters - Liebes@@ message to former Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ age fighters to welcome them again in the company .
the campaign of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ fighters - which then shall be handed in personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for reconciliation was created on the World Summit of Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate , who took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 , where Leonardo and Crist@@ ian had the opportunity to talk shortly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this declared that we love the people who love to write on Valentine &apos;s Day of thousands of love letters , but those who need to have much more need@@ ful .
he has said that he continued to share his love with people in this year , the most ur@@ gent issues .
thus , the plan , letters of hope and support for former fighter of the F@@ ARC that now find their place in society and to build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make dis@@ course from a war history to a common history of peace . &quot;
so far more than 2000 letters were collected in the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos; I never thought that someone would forgive myself &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over on March 19 in one of the UN camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca .
a group of 40 students from the University J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the town council of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Stiftung Bog@@ ot@@ Art re@@ ists to make letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC on how they had done it earlier to meet the commands of their leader .
but this time they received no prec@@ epts , but letters filled with sub @-@ based people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all parties . &quot; it is incredible how many different feelings one can walk in just a few hours - from fear to luck and everything that is between , &quot; telling the political knowledge student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z Av@@ ila later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Govern@@ ors of Valle del Cau@@ ca Province described this unforgettable experience as follows :
after we handed over the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of Gu@@ er@@ illa fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ book &quot; ( a kind of tent where the gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ age fighters ) saw , I saw a gu@@ er@@ illed war@@ der who wrote some .
I had afraid to go down , because in addition to him on the bed a M@@ GL @-@ pom@@ egran@@ ates , a dead@@ ly weapon in the village .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I asked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone wrote me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
never in my life any man has written me so nice , so do I answer you . I suddenly ran out tears about the che@@ eks .
I moved on him completely , and set me beside the pom@@ p@@ ons .
perhaps he was sorry for war , it was sorry for all the years of the faithful companion of this struggle , and wanted to help him to write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never had something different from life as a war . the F@@ ARC was not expected to preserve him and his six brothers before the hunger strike . &quot; I never thought that someone would have been forgiven to me for my mist@@ akes .
but now I know that there is a society there , that is waiting for us with open arms .
until now I have learned only how I have to handle with weapons .
but now there is peace , I can learn many things and work in dig@@ nity . &quot;
new voices
for the start of the students , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came to a discussion round .
the students were up grown up as early as the war and the F@@ ARC already existed in Ver@@ bor@@ dered .
therefore , the leader of the F@@ ARC declared the history of organization , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years , we witnessed how we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can contribute to the society in this country .
for a goal of this size , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them .
Manu@@ ela was impressed by :
these people had not found to hear , who had never seen hearing and had no elec@@ toral law , and to recognize that people who have seen often as Monster , and even hate them , even people with beautiful feelings , which were turned by their hab@@ itats and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality , in which the country lives , does hurt me .
but it comfor@@ ted me that all men - also those who have killed and so much damage caused us to bring us and give us a smile and a h@@ ug .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote to Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the arch@@ bishop of the city of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
the column was made that after de@@ fo@@ rest@@ ation peace would rule .
but this is not the case .
as long as it ine@@ quality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to attack the weapons and justi@@ fies for their rights . and that &apos;s also quite justified ( ... ) .
we now put down from the F@@ ARC on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all the def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ide@@ ology belong to them - to rise over all those who dream by a country in the war .
we give you our word , aff@@ ord our contribution and bring sacrifice , because we know from their own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend life as the basis of existence , many difficulties are coming .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .
a woman talks about the persec@@ utions in Ch@@ echn@@ ya and the Life of Kad@@ y@@ row

hom@@ osexual and que@@ er people who live in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a large bandwidth of d@@ angers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and stress .
with terr@@ ors , activists have experienced the reporting of the last months over the persecution of Ch@@ echn@@ ya in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat , like a Dam@@ o@@ cl@@ etian value related to the dor@@ m L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q community , is not only built overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who has shared some of their experiences with us and has talked with us about what happened in the republic .
the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered the international impact after several months , after the reports were published , killing torture and killing que@@ er men in the Republic of them@@ ed .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Now@@ aja Gas@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , who had suspected que@@ er men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; you have brought a Monster to the World &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ wife , was born in Gro@@ sn@@ y , and grew up there .
since her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she was growing , her aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , why she went to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ et@@ ch@@ enen found out of their land woman , the hunt was opened at Sab@@ rina .
from fear around her life , she moved to the United States last time .
Sab@@ rina : I was a volunte@@ er hel@@ per at a human rights organisation .
one day was told me that someone needed my help .
this was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ gression that was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took them without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , he thought it would be a friend , a copy of my documents , and spread them everywhere on the internet , with my telephone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos made by my documents by the W@@ hat@@ s@@ App made the round .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
when I was just doing a few shopping opportunities from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying : &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
when I turned me , I felt some in my body , but I did not hurt me .
then I heard a set but this time on Che@@ chen : &quot; how long will you still honour the family ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I don &apos;t know that there was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost the consciousness and a@@ wo@@ ke of the final du@@ des in the hospital .
apparently some women had all taken and started to cry out .
the man was fled .
the women had a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two times in my right pul@@ mon@@ ary .
OC Media : in which sp@@ ice were you laid - in the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , since there is still my male name , but the doctor stood and laid me at the women .
I am very grat@@ eful for this .
when I read his name for the first time in his office , I got it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ cas@@ ian name .
but he turned out as good human being .
I am grat@@ eful to him that he was resp@@ ect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month at the hospital .
I got thre@@ ats in the last February .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , stranger , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a Alp@@ trau@@ ma .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
the requested to re@@ send me to Ch@@ echn@@ ya in order to prove that all that was a lie .
they set ab@@ sur@@ d demands : some told me , I must prove it , going up in the streets without the streets ; others said that I had not changed my family in the official television that everything was bad , and Photoshop .
I have grain size C - what should I say in television ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this print ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still difficult for them .
some older people said once my mother on the street .
they said to her , &quot; You have brought a monster to the world , not only your family , but the whole republic is damaged .
we can not touch you because you are a good woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother was too much and she lay down a stri@@ ck around the neck .
fortunately the neighbours and they saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and already a few hours later , under the window a car with dark window plates and a number plate with a 95 .
after it happened for the third time it was clear that there was a little la@@ zy .
my human rights friends over@@ tested the number@@ ing - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activ@@ ist .
for safety reasons I will not give their names , but I want to say that I remember them all . they really helped me .
with her help , I left the country , but then something happened .
I can &apos;t understand how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother soon as soon as I arrived .
I bought it without register without me without notice .
I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the gar@@ bage .
came and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered at a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment , when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe in security , only because you have left the country ?
our people know , in which Hotel du steck@@ st . you even know your room number .
just to prove it : it &apos;s the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
that was indeed my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
but we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , but this is a table theme .
I still bear some traditional Cau@@ cas@@ ian elements .
so much I wish it to do that this se@@ el@@ ic barrier can &apos;t be overcome .
I always say that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to viol@@ ate them .
if we ch@@ ill with camera , I give me good effort to look like the person , to which they remember from their past - so on my male form .
but this is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have taken place ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for whom I needed more information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke with som@@ eb@@ ody who saved one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that during Ram@@ ad@@ an had not been arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an were hardly able to wait , and he didn &apos;t lock a new shaft .
most likely they will focus on family and relatives .
so that I , they probably invite the relatives to take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; glory &quot; through blood of gen@@ ius .
OC Media : are you too pregnant women in this mystery ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of me says , there wouldn &apos;t be many .
if , in particular , those who have no rich relations , or who were left out of their relatives , Kad@@ y@@ rows are to put in judgment .
as far as I know , they will be held there , so that they can present them later as terror@@ ists .
say : should they be killed , you will show her body in television , and claim that they attacked some village or military base .
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , but targeted to radi@@ alize themselves .
OC Media : is this now only a mut@@ ation or have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I have just imprisoned someone who had been imprisoned in Ar@@ gun for a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison , after being grown up .
there has been nothing new of them .
they simply have taken them .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was taken away as those people were taken away .
but until now they were not introduced as a Band@@ its , there was no reports so far . we guess that such promotions are possible .
why else would it not be allowed to shave these people ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ apping of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non@@ traditional &quot; orientation , already in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always bore my hair for ever .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think before 2003 I was already known in Gro@@ z@@ ny , when I lived there - and I never had problems .
in the Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sh@@ aria was applied , I never had problems .
on the contrary , it was much more secure than now .
Russia would initially wanted to bring us to the &quot; Civil@@ ization &quot; but ultimately rejected us into the stone period .
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were exhau@@ sted ; I had coloured lashes , bore tube and short T@@ ops .
the safety ministry of the Sh@@ aria has never bent me a hair .
in front of the Russian theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people hit as me .
it was a small place where several ben@@ ches stood , and the whole city knew thereof ; they knew why men , young people met there .
we have never been insul@@ ted .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a speech : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . this means : &quot; mo@@ ck not over the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
you often say it often to children , if they are funny about sick people .
OC Media : so did they simply shut up their eyes in front of you because they believed , you are sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never regre@@ t@@ ailed me , never ch@@ ased and never defeated .
OC Media : how long did this sort of mercy ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row came upon the plan .
when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began to speak in TV about Mor@@ al .
he did not say about us by se , but above the behaviour of women .
yet - we could feel like to change the people in the city .
who had pen@@ ed before and suffered , looked at once with sus@@ pic@@ ion .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I couldn &apos;t feel like the situation in the republic .
OC Media : what activity is you going to go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much enough in the USA .
apart from that , I &apos;m still acting as an activ@@ ist .
at present , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I commun@@ ions with them as a kind of Psych@@ ologist .
we perfectly organize tea , gathering , I buried them to the hospital and help them to get essence cards .
I &apos;m not a cent for this .
I discovered these people even when I climbed to a refuge .
I am Mus@@ lim@@ a and I would like to help those who need help .
OC Media : apply a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is al@@ thy .
such is nature , that has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens who prophesy to you with foam before the mouth , there is no pigs .
those who have the Cab@@ ard@@ iner who have the o@@ ard@@ iner , which are the Russians also exist : but on the whole planet it is - but not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it is very pleasant to hear what to hear .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practic@@ ing Muslims who go into the mosque , and during Ram@@ ad@@ an keys - live together with men .
do you know , many think about tran@@ sid@@ ity of men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a Tru@@ ste@@ er .
these are two different things - two different kinds of feelings to be exact , different life settings .
for me , it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and to be ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I will be so personally , but my last in@@ time relationship is now already longer than one year ago .
and I am not sad - I know that I am now myself .
local groups war@@ ns before an increase of self @-@ moral within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arabian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ Community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region is suffering from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last months there is a strong increase in self @-@ moral .
the picture of the Arab worker in Iran was made by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .

the self @-@ burning of a man called J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 , the des@@ per@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ community in Iran , which is influenced by poverty and unemployment .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered among attacks , depression , and he was able to keep his own help for his own help , so Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and anonymous .
a video held on YouTube , the moments after he had lighted off itself .
some people put it fast to delete the fl@@ ames again , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought into the Tal@@ eg@@ h@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , bur@@ ns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only suicide committed in August in the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activ@@ ist before the spot , that even more men could take the life .
the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah Mou@@ ss@@ awi and Sh@@ ah@@ ab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - captured this month .
their stories have a thing together : there were all family members , who are due to persec@@ utions on the Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and unbe@@ atable , to feed their families to nour@@ ish and secure work .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , which is located in the most part of Iran &apos;s Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community , was sh@@ aken by a pro@@ found economic crisis , causing the native Arab population to contest their hab@@ itat .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy took power over and took great efforts to finish ethnic autonomy in all Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region there are some of the largest in Iran existing oil and gas fields as well as some of the most successful and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , regional economy develops only slowly , and the native population gets only little of this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and relaxation .
the Iranian regime is rejected by the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Arab@@ s system@@ ic jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government also has a variety of dem@@ ption , the waters of the Arab areas in the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and Gh@@ om are .
these dem@@ ons have only led to destroy the devast@@ ation of destruction in the region , and local agriculture as well as the fish and palm trees industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ ha@@ w@@ zi @-@ adolescents grew up to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director General for Co@@ operative , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , announced that 5 % of the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is , who completed a work in primary school , completed 55 % of a secondary school and received 45 % a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... it aims to destroy the Spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Iranian ancest@@ or human rights activists in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and ra@@ cial ethnic discrimination , leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of self @-@ mor@@ ing under the young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ men .
Doh@@ im@@ i said that especially the unemployment has become even worse . the reason is a combination of a high number of in Ah@@ wa@@ z &apos;s coming ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process :
since func@@ tion@@ aries and institutions is prefer@@ able to adjust Arab labor forces , the local Arabian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will have access to work in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the Spirit of national resistance of young Arab@@ s and to conquer their lifetime outside their home Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to hide their advantages and sur@@ names to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , as Arab names are not toler@@ ated at the workplace , because the Spe@@ ech of the Arab language or the carrying Arabic clothing .
given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i have to bear human rights activists , before the location explosive .
it remains to wait if the world had w@@ akes up , and it takes about it .
the main reason for suicide is un@@ treated depression .
depression is treatments and is avoid@@ able .

the following article is an revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was subject of several discussions where many different positions came into expression .
you can read in comments under the original text .
if I say that I am no femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women who draw himself as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with Fr@@ ust .
they wonder why I am not part of movement .
they even have well thought scientific and social arguments from me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we should generally be all the femin@@ ist * .
for example , in spite of the same education , women still earn less money than men .
that women are still under str@@ ingent observation if it comes to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epi@@ demic .
or that cultural and social nor@@ ms still ensure that women so@@ aked in various fields of life to a glass ceiling , and that discrimination based on sex are still across through the many different countries and belie@@ fs .
all this is aware of me and known .
I am convinced of it and I suffer twice and triple .
I am a black woman .
and yet : if I come on skin colour , on black c@@ is women to suffer black tran@@ si@@ den@@ te women , on black women in the L@@ GB@@ TI@@ Q church or on black women , if I have already been physically used , se@@ el@@ ian and verb@@ al need , both in as well as outside of femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists .
nevertheless , however , are all accepted that women - all women have to come together to sing &quot; their voices and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &apos; to sing &quot; to meet the equality ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about it , in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , a institutions of qu@@ anti@@ zed form is motiv@@ ated , which we are exposed to black women on two times .
or about that black women and women of other eth@@ nic@@ ities and women often earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background more often beyond the school are exp@@ elled as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women are exposed to a higher risk in black don@@ or and women with a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence against the partnership , as white women .
on the other hand , I want all men , all men , and all men each other than the same rights . on the other hand , I can &apos;t join me as a black woman in whose center the white woman is refused to consider un@@ righteous in their thinking , which relate to gender as well as the skin colour of a person .
I &apos;m exhau@@ sted and will no longer be strug@@ gling to fight my affili@@ ation in a white femin@@ ist builders who has always reg@@ ained me and countless black women always and always rejected .
def@@ endants in 1851 , in her speech : &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; and I also refuse me to justi@@ fy an ide@@ ology in which the black woman in a historic way is a deser@@ ted and mar@@ gin@@ alized beings .
I sof@@ tened to join me in the group , which can absorb our customs and customs , to describe your eg@@ o@@ cent@@ ric program .
I will not try to take white women the importance of over@@ laps of skin colour and gender . as some of them continue to keep the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to revi@@ ve them .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women from different her@@ al@@ ism and ren@@ ders from white Femin@@ ism , is still the word &quot; Femin@@ ism &quot; in his name .
I &apos;m going to release me full and completely from Femin@@ ism , who has been called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of me for a white femin@@ ist par@@ a@@ dig@@ m that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tional@@ ity is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever before we will define black women to our own performances and give us into the hospital that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ c@@ ana wom@@ an@@ ism : Rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing O@@ ur@@ selves ( about : Africa @-@ Wom@@ an@@ ism ) says that we can defend ourselves to our own way , in which they can be perfectly safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , se@@ el@@ ian , physical and even the spiritual elements can be avoided by the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists immediately retri@@ eve separ@@ at@@ ism and exclusion , after they have read these lines , please refer to the hypo@@ cris@@ y and contra@@ di@@ ctions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ ist environment I can raise black women and women of other cultures because I existed in this par@@ a@@ dig@@ m .
I will be accepted because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a portion of this par@@ a@@ dig@@ m .
I , a black woman can flour@@ ish in a environment , in which my life cannot over@@ taken , nor will be igno@@ red .

Paraguay : women and their difficult fight against violence
a group of women represents &quot; The wine @-@ crying women &quot; to bring their pain about the women in the country and in the region to express their re@@ jection .

the following article is the shortened and modified version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by Kur@@ ds . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # we@@ ili@@ ch@@ un@@ e@@ fr@@ au@@ bin ) , which reports about the Gew@@ ähr to women in Paraguay .
most names were changed for the protection of the affected persons .
one police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that she was nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , its ex@@ partner who had become violent .
since the end of her relationship has been around time and the police said , her statement would be put to the acts , but more could not be done .
when a further wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena was pointed out because of abuse , the acute display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez has nothing to do .
a few days later the second wife passed her ad .
the Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ ate of violence against women is difficult .
if women list@@ ened at all once , they generally receive any support from the State .
in many cases , women also have fin@@ anci@@ ally dependent on men who are mis@@ used . this explains why only 20 % of all women who ad@@ mit , victims of violence at all , are to report on the prosec@@ utor authorities .
contents and statistics of in@@ clusions 1 In@@ visible mist@@ re@@ ation and a legal system that nothing under@@ n@@ imm@@ ed 3 Paraguay laws : good approach , lack of implementation and st@@ ats
it is hard to determine how many women really har@@ assed , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher at the Centro de Hum@@ ent@@ aci@@ ón y E@@ studios , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various information and reports that show the extent of the gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; explains them .
however , the figures available are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the At@@ tor@@ ney General At@@ tor@@ ney at the State At@@ tor@@ ney at 9@@ 600 were arrested because of domestic violence . 70 % of them went about violence against women .
86 % of ads in the police arrived by women .
there were more than 5000 ads due to domestic violence in peace . 86 % of the ads came from women .
in ads , 40 % of women reported that they were physically challenged , 55 % of women spoke of mental abuse .
these statistics show not the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Frauen@@ minister Ana Bai@@ ard@@ i , only few of this offen@@ ders are actually indicated . &quot; on every woman who are not able to do in Paraguay for mental abuse , 9 women , who do not do this .
on every woman who are reim@@ bur@@ sed for physical abuse , two women , who do not do this , declared it at the end of 2014 .
there &apos;s no own criminal case in Paraguay , the prosec@@ utions authorities can not document in@@ adequate , how many women are murdered every year from their current or former partners .
by August 2016 , journalists were killed at least 12 cases of women in the country .
the co @-@ ordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay have been documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay all ten days a woman died of violence through men .

invisible Mis@@ sions and an legal system that cannot under@@ tak@@ eth nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the fixed gir@@ l@@ friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the name of all her former friends .
at the beginning , she didn &apos;t want to do this again , but after that , she should always regre@@ t@@ ted them .
today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and not more with Carlos together . however , they carried out the psych@@ ic violence against women - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe recogni@@ z@@ able :
I have never thought that I would have a victim of mist@@ re@@ action .
if I have read about it earlier , I always thought that only women have happened to teach , because they can cause themselves of violent men .
I was convinced that I would never happen that .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment by Carlos Vera .
without name , they wrote posts on Facebook , in which they described his interests and several attacks during their two @-@ year relationship , and told how he had isolated them .
many people answered their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , whether he have lifted up his hand against them and refused to be revealed that his behaviour was also a form of mist@@ re@@ action .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why she had fallen so long by Carlos and did not leave it earlier .
it seemed almost as they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least would have a certain school@@ ing .
Victoria Santos , who was not from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that their former partner made them har@@ assed .
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o @-@ CRE@@ O network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) which consists of women who are all victims of mist@@ re@@ acts in any way .
in the group you can speak with others on their experiences , listen to each other and help each other .
they do this , what many others do not do : take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as Case everything began with mental abuse .
their we@@ al@@ thy partner managed to convince her that she was valuable .
then he began to beat them .
Vict@@ ori@@ as ads in the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , she received no support .
it led a trial against her former partner who developed into an in@@ compreh@@ en@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and their native country , mainly by money , power and the influence of their former partner .
Paraguay laws : good approach , lack of implementation
&quot; there are many laws in Paraguay , which are very good , but not applied .
the ad is a way full of resist@@ ors and a fight against corruption in the j@@ udi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria Santos .
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organization for women in Paraguay , also provides great problems in the application of the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed under the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an parliament , who became known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ell@@ as ( # Für@@ y ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ Less ) are part of a campaign on Twitter which is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original design of the law sees to explain Fem@@ iti@@ d to a separate criminal off@@ ence and har@@ der it is the case already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the legisl@@ ature was altered in some points , in order to win the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law , that the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alization of Ab@@ bot @-@ net , which currently banned in Paraguay , and to be punished with up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill had intended to cost the most of the ( bureau@@ cr@@ atic and economic ) of the process which have to bear the victims of violence even though they just wish to obtain a secure accommodation and secure accommodation .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law is not effective when the legisl@@ ature does not provide sufficient financial resources for this :
in Paraguay it is seen as part in human relationships .
this must take place here , that violence is not considered to be more than somewhat nor@@ ms .
whoever is silent in view of these facts makes it guilty and contributes to that the perpet@@ rators will come out .
we have to put it as long as long display until abuse of abuse .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Senate . previously , parts of the law has been changed , including a passage that partners had proclaimed in cases of domestic violence against reconciliation .
the opinions about the changes will go apart .
the section regarding reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the ag@@ g@@ ressor , its victims again attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the string of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political Viol@@ ence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of parts of the law is considered a big set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media in Oman a year after the prohibition of an newspaper continue to attack attacks
&quot; this website was closed due to a decision by the Minister of Information &quot; on the homepage of the forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n .
more than one year ago , the Chinese authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of her reporting on corruption in the sult@@ ant .
You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues in prison where he served a prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , were also arrested and placed in court later .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power since 1970 , after spending his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn T@@ aim@@ ur .
since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , the principal minist@@ ries in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces , Finance , Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the sult@@ ans of the sult@@ ans is characterized by the persistent efforts of security forces , the public fre@@ ed@@ oms , including press freedom , restri@@ ct and human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ gger and other activists .
the authorities restri@@ cts peaceful and legitim@@ ate activities in the field of human rights systematically , and activists , also , their views on the public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and inc@@ eption three of their editors within the last year is a hard blow for the freedom of the press in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , which has been reported on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) since its inc@@ eption in 2007 , until it was forbidden by the authorities in August 2016 .
on July 28 , 2016 , security forces Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor of Az@@ am@@ n , was published an article entitled &quot; High @-@ Fundam@@ ental parties &quot; hands of Justice &quot; which was taken by corruption in the judicial authority and the mixture of high @-@ level officials .
in the report , government officials accused of having set up a ruling in Oman under pressure , ruling the ruling in an inheritance .

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , member of the editor Committee , was arrested by the ISS . on his arrival , he was arrested by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 the ISS took the deputy chief editor You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had served as chief editor for Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
the newspaper was closed on un@@ certain times after the Minister of Information had given the statement that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on any way , including online , will be banned from August 9 , 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the trial took place in Mas@@ k@@ ath the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Ab@@ ri .
the Tribunal sentenced the three journalists to prison sentence and ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both found among others because of inter@@ ruption of public order , &quot; abuse of the internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ excav@@ ation of the state &quot; condem@@ ning . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty in addition to the violation of an audience of publication and crimes .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j was sentenced to three @-@ year @-@ old pen@@ alties and cash pun@@ ctu@@ ation in the amount of 3000 om@@ an Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ Ab@@ ri was sentenced to a year jail and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) , after having an issue of an information network for spreading material that could represent a danger for public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , a damage deposit of 5000 om@@ an Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) was set and he was released in prison on 22 August 2016 .
on 26 December 2016 , the Appeals Court of Al @-@ Ab@@ ri sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison on 26 December 2016 .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after carrying out his six @-@ month prison sentence in Mas@@ k@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he served his own prison sentence .
in addition , the Court of Appeal also decided to close the decision of the Ministry of Justice to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
in spite of decision of the Court &apos;s decision to allow Az@@ am@@ n the newspaper was exposed to attacks by the government &apos;s government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information received a statement by which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Justice personally signed a further instruction in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and with which the Minister issued a further time against the decision of the Appeals Court , announced the publication of the newspaper .
the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where in Oman at recent times the press freedom was viol@@ ated .
for further injuries , for example , the closure of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to hire its operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalists Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the official authorities are still not prepared to prepare a substantial violation of the press freedom .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the official authorities to :
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately release and un@@ conditi@@ onally ;
2 . a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n to create their journalists in their work ;
3 . protect the Press Freedom in the Land and
4 . under all circumstances ensure human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman their right human rights work , without fear and without fear , including judicial authorities .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understanding
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ er 2016 in Zambia , picture is carried out by understanding
medical research in Africa is only rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that is addressed one of the most ur@@ gent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the demand in the place of medical research , there are two reasons for a lack of global health professionals , many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical demand on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ culosis and malaria have in the p@@ oo@@ rest countries of Africa far more serious effects than elsewhere , and lack of investments in the research of these diseases by the phar@@ maceuticals are a great problem .
second , research , which is carried out by African scientists themselves , in order to establish its own research capacity in Africa . a major role of science and technology can only be eligible for economic growth in the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it war@@ er is director of the Centre for expl@@ oring inf@@ ectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epi@@ demic showed first engraved effects on the national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Louis@@ iana , later in Indiana .
as Post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he resear@@ ched themselves on HIV @-@ virus , before he decided to go back home to assist the sam@@ ic health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. Warri@@ ors discussed about the future of medical research in Zambia and over abuse of media over these research .
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. Warri@@ ors speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ er RW : at the moment the emphasis lies on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ ic National Programme for anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I use a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens .
g@@ v : what are your opinion about the important current scientific topics in your country and in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed differently .
this must change , otherwise we will always stay receiver , rather than M@@ acher rather than ever .
the solutions that we get are often not good in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use them here .
g@@ v : where does financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find appropriate scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are being supported differently .
it is difficult to find people who come back or come here , because funding and development opportunities are better in other countries .
g@@ v : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research that you didn &apos;t had before ?
RW : basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , continuous supplies with electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
g@@ v : how is the public opinion about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would propose that critical thinking and scientific methods to be taught in schools to improve the situation .
g@@ v : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they concentrate , and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there are needs of special scientific training , beginning in any age .
social sciences , computer science , Big Data , investig@@ ational health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it .
g@@ v : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as scientist in Africa over western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often , there are a limited speed , things to do , and the resulting access to scientific expertise that represent challenges here .
the system that magazines are only accessible to payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited amount of available information and speed of research .
from the USA to India : how to change global food production such as &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers
this contribution by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine published on solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ dish , the first plant , cultivated by NASA ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts in space and has been hon@@ ours .
for nearly 20 years , Mort@@ on work was only allowed through its own in@@ crimin@@ ating and the question as many sal@@ ads can get limits .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not use them for breeding .
the patents are not only suitable for individual varieties , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special rotor or green or cont@@ am@@ inated leaves .
over the last years , more such patents have been applied to more plants such as cer@@ eal or cart@@ els types . due to this trends , plant bre@@ eders , environmental protection and experts ensure food safety around the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of thousands of old tradition , mort@@ on still uses let@@ tu@@ ce , but meanwhile it takes longer , since its work is increasingly worthy of getting more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is , as it was in a river a b@@ oul@@ ders , to whom I should sh@@ run@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , let &apos;s do that now , but it is a break with breeding tradition , &quot; says he . &quot; I think that these patents are going to go far too far .
and if they stand before court , no one can withstand a new salad of sal@@ ads , because all features are already patented . &quot; he makes it so good as possible and try to recover those features , which he wants .
however , it is very careful and lab@@ ors , not to use material that is protected as intellectual property .
he also joined one movement that is always greater in the USA and anywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ bre@@ edings ) .
ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have been bred and eaten at the Sor@@ ted Out@@ red@@ dish of the &quot; greenh@@ ouses &quot; of the station bred and eaten . there &apos;s been tested whether plants can be cultivated in space .

it is no co@@ incidence that this name sounds like that it would come from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for Open Source &quot; seed ) can be inspired by motion for free &quot; Open Source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copyright protected software .
it was called into life to ensure that some plant species and gene are not protected as intellectual property and can be used permanently for plant bre@@ eders .
as part of the initiative , shortly Oss@@ i , U.S. bre@@ eders could also under@@ take that others can use them free from them .
this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed , and they can sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eders allow you to cross your seed , and it is not immediately going out - two aspects which are prohibited or prescribed by many plants .
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its start in 2014 .
economic prospects outlook
Professor of the University of Wisconsin - Madison and Oss@@ i Board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control over the seed and the possibility to discipline new plants , both important for food safety and environmental protection .
seeds require a role in major merge such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter with natural resistance to produce seed .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement is not busy with genet@@ ically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genet@@ ically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; who would like to buy our aim and increasingly important examples in the global agricultural industry , as it is offered in August or September 2016 , should also know that the way that vegetables are cultivated as well as this vegetables is bred .

Oss@@ i Suppor@@ ters argu@@ ably that the future of food supply is end@@ anger@@ ed , since the available gene pool because of the more abundant mental property rights on plant material , which is thus always restricted , un@@ parall@@ eled .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive Director of Oss@@ i , has been involved in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rot and their availability . it found out that about one @-@ third of all cart@@ els are protected as intellectual property , making it either even usable for plant bre@@ eders .
for other plants , such estimates are still not yet , but experts like Lu@@ by , that mass@@ ac@@ red plants are patented as wheat in even larger style as a salad or carrots .
a Question of Vis@@ ions
plants become so far@@ med that they may have targeted characteristics - of such that their taste or her color improves up to such , due to them th@@ ri@@ ve in certain environments and thre@@ ats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders is decre@@ asing because of increasingly more patents . genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever before , since the changed terms through climate change are much worse .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ speaking spokes@@ woman Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to , that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ itation activities . with a total of four gene banks and the cooperation with institutions such as the agricultural ministry of the United States set the company for the preservation of genetic diversity .
however , however , the view is that intellectual property will promote other bre@@ eders , since &quot; patents and protection of plants varied Innovations &quot; . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow , as soon as the patent expired .
often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result .
such protection does not in@@ hib@@ its innovations , but promotes it by the public more material and know @-@ how to be provided . &quot;
Mort@@ on looks different : 20 years to wait until a patent pending , but certainly no innovation .
and if you have to wait so long to plants to plants that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one would have already lost the fight .
the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources always have been a general practition@@ er always should remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ ting incenti@@ ves are not attractive for us .
we want to make farmers to their work .
that &apos;s why it is advis@@ er and it is impossible to be impossible , if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
in total , Mort@@ on is distur@@ b on the concept of patented , plant features : &quot; we are creating the characteristics really itself .
the plants form them themselves and as bre@@ eders , we have no idea how the plants do it .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for the Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US state of Oregon and Oss@@ i , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who bre@@ eders a variety , breeding his own values in them .
those who believes to the industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures are to be required to cultiv@@ ate the cultivation of her@@ b@@ icides , which bre@@ athe in his varieties of this concept of agriculture .
my concept is exactly contrary . &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that move to international markets , but smaller than for example Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents have to survive the most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either re@@ ject it or keep it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case .
Frank Mort@@ on is based on its breeding garden Sal@@ ads in its breeding garden Sal@@ ads .
photo of Karen Mort@@ on .
Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ eders through the Av@@ oid of plant pat@@ ina would be innovative : &quot; it looks as I think with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that pat@@ enting .
I need some new material for my catalogue because I know that my competitors will sell my sor@@ ts in a few years , &quot; says he . &quot; with a patent man is protected 20 years ahead of competition , which makes it easy for my opinion . &quot; worldwide reson@@ ance
indeed , the United States appear to be a leader in the Open Source , but the concept has meanwhile spread across the whole world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , creating a &quot; open source plant for plant plants . the center with farmers works together and helps them to bre@@ athe new varieties that meet certain requirements .
it is also supported to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seed and sell their own .
the German Organization Agre@@ col works at an Open Source &quot; license which ultimately has a formal and legally binding form of Oss@@ i obligation for breeding in the European Union .
( regulations for breeding different from country to country where Oss@@ i obligation cannot simply be taken one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission declared that conventi@@ onally bred plants should not be patented . thus , she speaks for the current practice of the European Patent Office , the patents are allowed in conventi@@ onally cultivated plants .
however , a statement is not yet a law ; now it is to governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organised a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed companies in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed companies and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organizations and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend for pat@@ entation of seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed scheme , explains that the organization is currently able to raise global alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems for the planned next year of the official start .
a merger of environmental protection and development aid ( among them Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development organization US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database to seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Ess@@ ens - a Verb@@ und from aid organisations such as W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report published in which farmers have to bring to seed and improve seed policies , thus making a stable supply of food products .
in the report also the importance of a varied , local supply with seed for sustainable food systems emphas@@ ises - a connection , by Lu@@ by von Oss@@ i , hopes it will be able to recognize him soon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has especially been cultivated where and how something is cultivated , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to make people clear that more behind her food is &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the newest goals of the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
still un@@ lock the Egyptian authorities contents on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a column .
on the weekend of August 5th the Egyptian government closed the website of the Office Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and the Arab world .
in August , the network published a statement on Facebook , in which it critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step sharp and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region .
the Office Network for Human Rights Announ@@ ces lead @-@ - despite this attack and the Constitution of the Egyptian law and the Constitution should continue to pursue these objectives , so it was never so important as now . AN@@ H@@ RI confirmed that all technical possibilities should be exhau@@ sted to overcome and not ad@@ mit . we hope to meet our task to continue our task .
AN@@ H@@ RI is considered the first scen@@ sion website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blocked more than two months 21 websites , such as the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and Qatar @-@ based network of Al Jaze@@ era because of alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1st Human Rights Organization of the wave of web presses like victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / N@@ IZ@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ H@@ RI there is no access to the blog of the column and human rights scientist Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada no more access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada took his blog for spreading column and articles that he did not contact in Egypt for in Egypt .
now , the blog , which he addressed to circum@@ vent the Z@@ ens@@ ur@@ ad of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider of the supplier of Zi@@ adas blog is home , however , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after being arrested by Egyptian security forces during December 2013 , while he reported about the student protests , and recorded a video like the police of physical violence against two students .
his article are mainly around politics and human rights conditions in Egypt .
in a Facebook commentary Zi@@ ada said to the pl@@ ung by the government and reflected what this means to him :
those , blo@@ gs to lock is very old , however , in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the pl@@ ung of the blo@@ gs may not be meaning@@ ful for the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) It is managed to give me the feeling of a siege of siege ; An arrest , a su@@ preme assassination attempt on the national Security Council , re@@ charge blo@@ gs blo@@ gs , as well as any other website for which I worked .
2 ) They have proven that I had not written in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even if only a small audience .
I wish to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used to catch the post of articles in order to handle the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
however , after they have blocked him , and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the mu@@ ff@@ les go to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities closed on 24 May to 06 August 133 pages . these were technical testing in the networks of various Internet service providers ( IS@@ P ) , including orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the blocking of providers that was possible through the revers@@ ing of Internet en@@ sur and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
on Monday the 12th of June we did as the re@@ jection of websites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s began .
a such practice indicates the intention of the government to block content and filters to access the Egyptian users .
the situation is additionally scra@@ pped , that the c@@ ens@@ ur@@ ment must be made behind closed doors , which the Egyptian population does not have a legal basis , using which they can proceed against this actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack them as next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in the war ?
the inhabitants fight .

day of day report newspapers in Brazil with whis@@ per@@ formers made from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city of the country and home of numerous postcards from the country .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot at school , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Di@@ iev@@ es pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8500 soldiers of the army , Marine and Eagle Pass to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a strong financial situation , the Gew@@ al@@ tw@@ elle 2017 reached the highest level for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice was called to re@@ mot@@ ely access the United Nations .
reports like these are every day and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 16 August &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal , in which she announced , a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports about violence in the city are now published there .
the newspaper stated for their decision :
extra will continue to report about crimes , which happen in every big city on the world as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual intercourse , etc . everything that happens from the civilian standard and what happens in Rio , will be published in the heading &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our kind to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative , so we don &apos;t close our eyes as an journalists in front of the grave .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor said that this decision was no reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure .
extra is probably the only newspaper on all over the world with a war@@ fare in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war .
in the same video , a journalist , the newspaper was declared that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , 8@@ 43 areas , are explained by criminal organizations .
in the editorial article , the newspaper writes :
it is aware that a war dis@@ course if it is distor@@ ted , also the police can only shoot , and then the questions arise , too .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of m@@ af@@ ia and their partners .
is the designation &quot; War &quot; more than they are used ?
in an article on the News Portal The Inter@@ cept Bras@@ il arg@@ um@@ ed the journalist in Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , who would draw violence as &quot; war . &quot; this is a justi@@ fication of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to draw responsibility for the police .
this is not war .
this is the result of corruption and worse planning - such as additional at the analysis of the military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with in@@ sufficient investments in Personal , En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment and a historical and self @-@ pleasing neg@@ le@@ ation of the public service .
reminder : the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital .

Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the violent place in Brazil , &quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia is false : &quot; 22 of the 30 violent cities in Brazil are subject to statistics from the north and northeast of the country . these are the most recent data available .
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
if we look at the mor@@ nings per state , Rio is in place 16 , &quot; she writes .
the company Glob@@ o belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company South America , which , as Cec@@ í@@ lia , under@@ lines the security policy of the State since years .
to these security measures , the founding of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ que de Pol@@ í@@ cia Pacific ) , one of the state of Rio in 2003 , was created by the state of Rio in 2003 to conquer a Fav@@ ela with the use of a massive police program .
at the beginning , this actually led to a decline of for@@ ci@@ ble deaths . for some years , the U@@ PP had to protect many reports about ch@@ ic@@ ans and repression against poor communities , which should actually protect the neo @-@ created police unit , increasingly under PA .
on his Facebook page , the journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux from one of his articles from the year 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria for the name &quot; Civil War . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio is even serious consequences for human beings .
for this calls for the state to use means of funds and ways that are typical of a war , which is a sharp point in the territory , which is a sharp point in the landscape and to object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; ver@@ ast@@ ered balls . &quot;
war or her , fact is that the residents of the Americas will continue to suffer in Rio .
a week it is now that the police attacked the mountain with the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ o@@ zin@@ ho in order to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ emen .
am@@ id@@ st all these violence , this incident happened : a fruit res@@ eller died as a result of nuts that had fired the police out of a helicopter .

as a return , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can create their own mushrooms as &quot; li@@ fel@@ de food source . &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ near and perform the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the conventional , in Syria and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food business makes it an attractive food source for many residents of the besi@@ eged Ost Gh@@ out@@ a .
the Director of the Project , Sub@@ ject Nab@@ il , said to the French message agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided for the cultivation of mushroom because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ahmed L@@ eil@@ a , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years , this project has been known and pressed its relief out that it is now more and more &quot; of acquain@@ t@@ ness wins . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , use in consultation with the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ near da the humanitarian C@@ row@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
it is planned to impos@@ e 125 families of knowledge to plant@@ ing mushrooms , Dr. L@@ eil@@ a to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this writing , they reached over 100 % of its expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will earn up to Can@@ Do until Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative is directed to generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
due to the fuel scar@@ city , locally produced fuel made from plastics in order to supply generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with &quot; production from the regions from the regions , before they checked their quality , and whether they are suitable for consumption .
then they planted a small mushroom pic@@ king in a tub . when I managed to use a larger bath . and so on .
now they have designed a &quot; teaching yard for the region . &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have spread them everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a declared that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people with various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : fra@@ ction of siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new food source to the market .
spread of a culture of self supply by means of food waste ( such as paper , tea , coffee kit , cardboard , etc ) to the profit of new food .
the creation of new jobs , especially for women who work home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities , which are tied to their home .
he said , &quot; We hope to spread this idea in the whole world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the siege is visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to help us that our experiences in crisis areas are inspired and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand for the victims of fires in 2017
several hundred people are protest@@ ed on 21 October in many districts in Portugal and the justice for the victims of fires that were gr@@ illed in the north of Portugal .
two and forty people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government last week of solidarity with victims of the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the G@@ ali@@ zi@@ en region in Spain where there were 4 dead .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire cat@@ ches that spread themselves in the northern and central regions of the country and reached some 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande became a similar tragedy where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forestry system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite recordings , in 2017 alone in Portugal , about 500,000 acres of forest is burned - an area of the area of Lisbon districts .
in order to make you a better image of the Ernst of the location : there is no fire in 4 districts .
in Portugal , in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15 , 2017

numerous videos spread across the grid and show images that allow better in@@ sights into the event :
the se@@ eable tragedy
the goal of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better pre@@ venti@@ onal and fire fighting measures by the state .
the people asked why the civilian protection was not able to in@@ hibit the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
João Rodri@@ al by the Federation of farmers from Portugal explained the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did this no@@ where : there are dozens of times of open streets that have been surrounded by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria would have had a similar tragedy as in June , because the streets were closed very late . &quot;
in addition , construction permits in Ö@@ r@@ t@@ ances with a high level of Bran@@ dr@@ is@@ iko are asking .
a far @-@ reaching proposal on the roll form , which brought the government to serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was initiated by commun@@ es who saw the new rules as an obst@@ acle for investments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government led a loos@@ ening of the law , when the applic@@ ant was able to fall to self @-@ protection - that was an open rear door , so that everything could be built , &quot; leads João Sor@@ val in the same article in the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organisation Quer@@ cus made sure that large areas with eu@@ cal@@ ypt@@ us , trees made of light burning wood , itself , as in a devil , according to fires of this species .
in addition to these problems , the website of the civilian protection of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when residents were seeking or tried to contact persons who was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information provided : you used the own personal protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer of João P@@ ina in order to simpli@@ fy the work of the fire brig@@ ade and became aware of this fat@@ eful weekend in October , so that the server followed the rush of 400,000 users , that followed fires : the website counted more than half a million .

during one night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began the Taliban .
two years ago , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in group , which had overcome the short @-@ lasting one @-@ Soviet government . in Afghanistan , Afghanistan became a country of terr@@ ors and desp@@ air .
at this time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ ha@@ zn@@ i in Central af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan , for the last time with his family at dinner together .
even if his mother did not tell it then , she knew that she would not see her son very long , - maybe even more .
in the morning gray the boy should break up .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the fl@@ ames .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat was murdered by the Taliban , and many Haz@@ ara felt suddenly .
the Taliban always got closer to the Haz@@ ara well @-@ known Taliban .
many Haz@@ ara left the country toward Pakistan or Iran .
some days after his escape , A@@ ha@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
a few years he worked in a Koh@@ leg@@ ru@@ be . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took this , what was left of his low wages , and went into Iran . once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and towing sacks with mort@@ ars , heavier than he himself , to earn his lifetime .
at that time , the lives of Afghan refugees in Iran was influenced by mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; remembered A@@ ha@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived at a building site at the building site , which we worked on .
there was no services there and no heating . we hung nylon in front of the open window , so that we do not freeze the night at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without Pap@@ ers in Iran and made ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wreck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time was A@@ shar@@ af hom@@ eless , ran only through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day in food to help .
it is true that Italy due to relatively high awareness levels is a kind of second chance for past asylum seek@@ ers . however , it &apos;s true that the conditions for asylum seek@@ ers in the country are cat@@ astroph@@ ic .
the Human Rights Organisation of Civil liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system is suff@@ ers to transparency about a general lack of transparency .
the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers is housed in the more than 3000 &quot; special reception centres . &quot; this is an impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff . &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to a recording center when it officially opened an application for asylum - what can be applied for months after the registration of the asylum application .
until then people who have no money for an accommodation , either mentioned on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the road .
so there was A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ defiled soul helped A@@ shar@@ af to free out of these conditions soon .
after he had made various works in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af put his entire spar@@ se into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this ran so well that after a while still a second hostel and a snap@@ shot opened .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ at@@ is Suc@@ cess Story the theme of the documentary &quot; handic@@ d Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( german : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wah@@ i@@ di .
the film received the Venice City Award for the first time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepren@@ eurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Italian - are very difficult .
lots of bureau@@ cracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of obstacles .
according to in@@ official estimates , approximately 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries .
over the past few years , some of Afghanistan operating companies were created , among them sk@@ ill@@ eries , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants were even blessed in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ m@@ adi had the idea to his restaurant Oriental Experience , in which the wa@@ iter and the kitchen personnel are mainly refugees from various parts of the world .
the menu of restaurants tells us through the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts , the history of their journey to Italy .
the Afgh@@ ani entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ ul@@ og@@ na in Bologna and a s@@ ush@@ i restaurant in Rome are also Afghanistan .
but A@@ shar@@ af@@ s targets are far beyond the Italian gastronom@@ ic industries and retail , and targets to the country , which he had to leave for teen@@ ager as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where a risk is , there are possibilities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I never forget my land and I can &apos;t live happ@@ ily if I know that my people suffer .
I have a project for farmers from the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of the company and have to get the same options like all the others . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af has plans to learn plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul , where human being and preserv@@ atives can learn . &quot; so , they can sell their harvest from the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; says he .
the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through un@@ certainty and doubt but at the end the stability and prosper@@ ity .
A@@ shar@@ af made this journey itself . now he wants to help others in Afghanistan on this way .

those who missed this step could be sentenced to six months in prison or the end of a penalty .
the Act , which was rejected by sixty members of the members of Parliament , is currently subject to D.@@ L@@ ative and the constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there .

if the law should be adopted , this could mean up to three years in prison for the convicted .

Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , as much more than 700 protest@@ ers who had been arrested during the same incident , four years in prison to a court sentence .
recently , his sentence was moved on 20 May , because the prison sentence moved to human rights groups to bring the def@@ endants from prison in the Court of Justice .

will China take social media to force their identification ?
according to the new regulations of the People &apos;s Republic of China , social media will need a permission before they write messages in social media or share .
