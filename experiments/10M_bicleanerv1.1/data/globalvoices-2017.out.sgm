<seg id="1">Although I visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year I would live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love to America is exceptionally great.</seg>
<seg id="4">As many of my generation I grew up with American movies, I had read about American music, American authors read and use his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a good profound effect on me that I was mainly due to an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">When 14-year-old I saw the grand Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a terrible reporter, who covered the murderous conspiracy of a oil painting, which were inclined to his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free according to Method Man, "I was it, as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else I would like to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year that I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only been reinforced.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "I always said," "" "America is the only country where I ever lived in whom I ever lived so welcoming that you are always who you are and it is easily acquisance in a community of equal people." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very low heat cover about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot was written about the tourism and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of its ascension is to me as he goes with his engthiness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops in his opinion behind the mountain, as it says so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he does, like a former colleague it, and explains his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afroamerican and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people responded to his statements and approved in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes, who won in the republican elections, was the highest number formed by the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans, who support these biguary person, I asked me?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not have Trump and his voters not with people in harmony I learned during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example, my Professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, people from all over the world, a low glorious human being able to talk about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, Trumps also voted by Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer," agree.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours therefore, the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity that I fought with Sandy Bahr, who fought their life for the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family who was treated me like their son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She is still suitable for the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who helped me with a lot of patience and grace, and helped us to get to the complexity of the American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise counsel has helped me much with my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those caused by them reduce my love to America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump helmed his way to the nominal Republican presidential candidate, they offered a stop and the counterpart in its limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump because they dealt either his racism and fanatiism, because they were ready to oversee these things, broke me almost the heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to draw the Trump elector as Rassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">The people replied, said one of my friends, is exactly what has led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficially and respectless and indicates an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears of hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that this voters, of which most white have been tuned for Trump, because they would like to win the control of a country, which she has disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they would perhaps say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who wrote the cruel decision to raise a man who looks back on those with regard to those that look differently than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "Whitelash" "". "as much as" "" "rejection of the White against all other Ethnias" "" "; vocabulary from white in Anplay on the White and whiplash, which means that the great Van Jones called" "" "did exactly what America did so great." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world estimate the American Ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background you may always have, America is welcome every welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country, as his presidents, elected twice the son of a Kenianers, whose history how he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of white America's promise and says: to Hell with multithiness, freedom of freedom and all term of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America, after 9 / 11, the white man is again at the Ruder, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all that I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier, who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">At a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud voice "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"were Muslims a place in your Americas?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" brood the quantity.</seg>
<seg id="52">"did Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered them.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your Americas? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they called them and their voices were loud.</seg>
<seg id="56">"would someone who doesn't know how to take a place in your Americas?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a one and loud "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan ended with the words: "God is thanks to Mr. Trump, is that not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land, for which his son had fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">That is now Trumps Land, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find no space in this new Americas.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks me my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican musical school of the Vicente Guerrero municipality in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the paraguaische City Cateura together?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music, which is played on both sites, does not only change the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music, who lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists, but worlds away from the nearby preColombian ruins and its world famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For some years now, La Banda de Música (musical bande) has been playing in the municipality: one out of children and adults, existing symphony orchestra, which has found their musical instruments a possibility to overcoming the surrounding poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the parish of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality, which is located in one of the poorest provinces Mexico, is known for their drugs abuse and the banking violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilots in which a musical project started and the youth had a rare hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations towards the music group, the local press noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to meet their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They come always laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the Trubel you are learning day for tag trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timbrel, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from rubbish</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village, which is practically above the largest garbage dump of Asuncion in Paraguay, on instruments which are made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with prepared instruments made of local firm waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura where the recycling of Favio Chávez started to turn parts of the query into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violate, viola, celli, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, which were all manufactured from the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music and music of the Beatles, from Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez reminds a local economist and musical instructor of the children of Cateura, at the initial time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First, it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearsal when the parents worked in the garbage. the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents, because many of them do not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something that he had never seen before: one out of the waste was made from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments made of recycled material, and is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) shows the musical performance on:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tons of rubbish every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the poorest - as people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring scene from garbage to music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These Eastern African countries show how technology and teamwork successfully combat the illegal fishing industry</seg>

<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published by Ensia.com, a magazine that has been designed specifically for international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-release occurs within the framework of an agreement with global Voices for the common use of Content Voices.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa there was then known that this ship had already operated illegal catch of illegal catch-fishing before the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The Eastern African countries were scattered over this way, and a little cause to welcome a bill of law to its coasts on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the comors, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilized quickly against the ship. they refused to share one of their harbours and refused to divide it to him as a fishing table.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "the Prime Minister is surrounded by countries that you simply refused everything," "" "Kiilu, an executive employee of the kenian fishing authority." "" "he is part of a team that discovered the ship once more." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was sold out of the waters of the region: it wasn't able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars on Liberia, due to pillaging the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which protects criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO stop illegal Fishing (Illegal fishery).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are alongside Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries that were expelled from their waters at that time.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "so we have eight countries that are involved and work together. they exchange information from and stand on each side where it is illegal fishing," says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable Trusts Project Ending. this project provides technical support.</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is regulated by definition: what is captured, is hidden since it is extremely difficult to occur. thus, Illegal fisheries is a main cause of overfishing regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By deliberate contempt of existing laws, by means of certain habitats and species, Illegal fisheries ecosystems may harm a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fisheries were once experienced by bureaucratic hurdles, with information between individual countries, so these actions are in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">For example, the individual countries may exchange for example now exchange licenses, news about suspected activities or details that can be noticed during a port spectrum.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open lake, using satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows to mark the authorities to mark Ships, which are fishing in banned areas - such as suspected driving conditions - such that the ship invites its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">In ideals, such studies can show whether the ships have a fishing licence, where they were on the road and possibly even if they have a criminal case.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing, can refuse to accept such ships in their harbours. what means that the ships can't sell their charge. and that they could even be forced to pay for the numbers of penalties, as in the case of the Premier.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "it's about significant financial losses for the owners, which means that the illegal catch is financially worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And this is what we want to reach, "says Per Erik Bergh, executive director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant, which also supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to gain an estimated 20 million USD in lost sales, which will lose eight members of the Swiss network HISH-i each year due to illegal fishermen that enter into East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing industry, which is due to the region's commercial fishing-catcher from all over the world. among these, illegitimate fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">These practices include actions like the sail under false flag, fake license papers, indication of phantasiennames, the fish protected species and fish in nature areas.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "they do not use the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of an unpaved control system," "" "says Long." "" "then, a ship was illegal and a country could say 'You will not run my harbour." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. "and exactly this legacupunchy tries to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front work.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspects.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has a criminal networks uncovered, which had counterfake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships who used several deceitful identities and has been persecuted and found.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its collaboration with INTERPOL, the international agency for combating crime, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances and preserved.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "some of our research shows us quite far in the co-organizing crime" "", "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that should help FISH-i, suspects ships of precise.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system which will always be further developed, also helps to hide the illegal ships.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to conceal their activities and their position." "" "says Duncan Copeland, Head analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NRO which also deals with fishing data and FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships turn off for example their automatic identification systems where they cannot be used by satellite.</seg>
<seg id="135">In addition, Copeland helps to build a system which combines various information levels. it should help FISH-i help to find criminating ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team African countries really affect the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth recently opened the platform Global Fishing Watch's platform Global Fishing Watch: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by the position of each traceable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "gather together with the neighbors to get a better image of what does it - that's just sense" "" "says he." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and to combine their resources for investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">We should do this at a global level. "Pew Charger Trusts will run a similar project, with which a global system scoring the persecution of ships.</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities are not only criminals, but they are also screams.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that were previously exploited without license and hardly to calculate with consequences, they now know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i participated in a 33% increase in fisheries sales since then boats can buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">Having helped FISH-i Somalia, Greko 1 found the inspectors there on board locks, whose use is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">Other countries notice these successes. "the effect is so strong that us now have to copy other countries," says Kiilu. "we have become an study project." in Western Africa, several hundred million dollars are due to illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are six countries closed in 2015, for the so-called West Africa Task Force. also they fight illegal fishing, after exactly the same model as FISH-i. "with safety, the aim is to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's most recent member country took his first major triumph: in October, it was Greko 1, a ship which was under false flag. and not only the ship was used without a license and were not allowed to have been banned.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship was still shown in forbidden waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia. "" "" with the removal of dimensional rules toward Greko 1, "" "" had a strong sign that they proceed against illegal catch of fishing, "" "" says Bergh. "" "</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time evidence that such a special, collaborative work in the entire world also works.

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview of Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, which was finally published on 23 August 2016 on Día a Día, an Argentine news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced to visit the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentine town of Cordoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano said in the context of the great La Perla-Ribera process in the province of Cordoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the process which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes investigates that were committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano doesn't have chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the brush, same name as his father to carry up to the brutal military operations in the La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, has suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">He held the family secret for 34 years.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation then I believed that which was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret magent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years you don't notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">I could not know that my father was a thief, subsequent and robbers.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no election: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendareridian. during the Argentine military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 in prison La Perla.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>

<seg id="212">This is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressed, who was accused of kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in nearly 100 cases and the abduction of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who knew the extent of the atrocities, which he had experienced in the years before a Federal Court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows that great power has a parent over his child, and how this child has chosen for himself a way of redemption.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the Sports Hall to the Military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me at the military base, I often went up with us in the sports hall. there I was rounded up with a boy, the martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">All known him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black-white photo and called me to identify my boyfriend.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are an arhole, you are rounded to you by one of the ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Pass only that they would not lead you out of one day, and I will save you.</seg>

<seg id="232">When he took me the second time he commanded me to get out. he led me to a barrack, in the cars, furniture, TV, refrigerators - simply all possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a little more wrapped popes and ordered to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big clumsy silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the barrack where the stolen objects had been completed and signed me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he interpreted to an open space and said:</seg>

<seg id="238">I spawed, and saw a couch, tortured on humans.</seg>

<seg id="345">The picture was widespread in social media.</seg>

<seg id="347">In the Japanese town of Kyoto, customers were able to extend a newly opened centre in which one can lengthen his driver's witnesses in the last month, in particular.</seg>
<seg id="348">On a sign the Japanese word of the (koreifensha), which means "older drivers" means, but perhaps also with blot backgrounds & # 8212; as "fearable motorists" translates.</seg>
<seg id="349">The false translation was dated from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the input range and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Machining of the original photos of Joshua Levine, divided into social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The error was the translator Julian Holmes, a residents of Kyotos, who did it attention to the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The daily Kyoto Shimbun is written in Kyoto:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">This is an insult for older people and in an international city such as Kyoto simply unacceptable, "Holmes" said.</seg>
<seg id="356">The incorrect English translation was first removed at first. the name of the drivers "(German:" terrible motorists ") was later replaced by the reasonable, if also grammatical is not the correct name" Elder drivers "(german:" older drivers ").</seg>
<seg id="357">The police of the Kyoto Prefecture claims for the translation errors. furthermore it declared that the error was already contained in the text that they had written by translators and that the translation was not checked on their correctness before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "I'm sorry that older people were buried through the inadequate correction (translation)." "" "he said the police." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News compiled a little more detailed with the phenomenon of the "terrible" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "fearful" was refused as an unreasonable description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents are involved, but definitely reason to worry.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto Prefecture for example, 1.941 were caused by seniors in 2005, which corresponds to a proportion of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, senior citizens filed 1.803 of a total of 11.850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">This thus increased its share to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents has fallen in total, the proportion of seniors caused by seniors in the same period has increased.</seg>
<seg id="366">The nameless does not mentioned reporter in the writing version of the article comments on the light that show how some Japanese seems to be apparent against older drivers:</seg>
<seg id="367">The article on Yahoo on the translation error received the following comments:</seg>

<seg id="369">- "so does the translation isn't really bad, isn't it?"</seg>

<seg id="374">The Engrish.com website is a true excavation for these bizarre errors in English.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translators are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">You need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the output text and active language skills to transfer him to target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active rule of target language - something that is in the native language. generally, the conviction is that translators in the target language - do not be in native language - native language.</seg>
<seg id="379">Such a French native language to translate from English to French - not from the French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as the mother tongue that could be translated into English. this may be lack of understanding for the surviving, cost reasons or the relatively small number of English speakers that can learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that have no foreign employees allow translations to have firing internally. then the Japanese employees, whose English knowledge is considered the best, to translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really good.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation are also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The provering and availed phrases that are created by machine translation will show that this technology can still replace non-human translators. this applies to some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangely English formulation in Japan, including T-shirts or bags, are used only for stylious reasons - not to be read or understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr users Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors like jewelry still acceptable or at least harmless. but by major companies or by the government who have the means to guarantee higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto uses a serious source for their translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="501">Published under Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parlids ordered a bill to "regulating the regulations regarding the use and commercial social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">If he is accepted by Parliament, users must register social media in Egypt with government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="504">Based on the law, then a place would be set up which was instructed to share social media citizens and citizens.</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with the acceptance of the law, useful and users have to register with their right names and number of staff numbers to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it fails to do this, this may cause a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, which consists of six paragraphs, and in local media including Youm7 and Egypt records, defines social media as "jedwede Application, which is running over the Internet and is used to communicate with others by means of voice, video messages and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is going through when the draft is being accepted, as it is not clear that the Egyptian government should not register the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure that the Egyptian government is currently able to ensure the regulation on the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattar, parliamentary delegation and supporters of the Legislative state, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a user name and password to come by the firewall, which blocks Facebook. "</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt plans to establish a firewall on national level around Facebook. due to them it would be necessary to submit to the Egyptians for Egyptians and Egyptians to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known so far that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts and experts on site are sceptical regarding the technical feasibility of the forefront.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Engineering (based on German "Leader") of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German "Egypt" Initiative for personal Rights "), told Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I have strong in the technical capacity and the understanding of neither authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion, they imagine that the same as they are violent in physical public and private spaces, it may also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I mean it, then this means that they shall apply a strong surveillance system to request citizens, which apply a permit or not. and that means a mad system to monitor the activities of people and also to provide a judicial process.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">In order to be approved as a law, the draft must first be discussed at the legislature of Parliament and the Constitutional committee, before it goes into the plenary.</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether his acceptance and exercise successfully will be successful or not, the draft "stands in line with a pro-military monument in parliament, whose senses will maximizes control and ensured that no deviation on the image surface is" says Raoof.</seg>

<seg id="526">A subspecies of the larger family of leopards, which arise by Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian Leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). altogether, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are always found due to Wilderei, loss and fragment their lifetime and since they are always less prey.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this specific type of leopard important?</seg>
<seg id="528">Like Raza in the video, "the Persian Gulf is the only remaining noise in the Kurdish ecosystem" and the health and the thrives of ecosystem also depends on that a large noise is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to watch a Persian Leopards in the free game is small and goes against zero. as the team in the video is therefore a great cat that they have a great cat in the camera that leaves Raza in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a educated Biologin shows Raza passionate and another side of her country, which consists of only war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">It has been involved in wild animals for six years and involved educational programs in Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>

<seg id="544">At the beginning of March 2017, the daily newspaper Kahoku Sheno, which was achieved for the northeastern Japan's daily newspaper Kahoku Shuto, which were affected by the "" "" triple disaster "" "" in March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had caused the catastrophe. "" "</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shanno Newspaper has its registered office in Sendai, which was in the prefecture of Miyagi. the prefecture of Miyagi was a common prefectures in Japan, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring communities Fukushima and Iwate were forced, because the tsunami had vanish the coastal towns of the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">Even the prefecture of Fukushima still experienced an atomic accident, some 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of Kahoku Sheno shows from a local point of view which was achieved six years later to rebuild the life of local communities.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains both the statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as the survey results of the affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">Construction industry in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Sheno Newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement parts (in the buckets of the Steel, saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was able to see the biggest success among the three prefectures, 80 per cent of the planned spare parts were finished.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima joined the final light with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">Even six years later, six years after the catastrophe, evacuated by accommodation accommodations (Cataple, kasetsu juutaku), moved to the final spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in accommodation categories.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="557">In 2011, the evacuated from Fukushima still live in notaries, whereas Miyagi was a successful one. more than 75 percent of the evacuated evacuated after the desertiers were settled in final homes.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the number is 34 percent here.</seg>
<seg id="559">The stand of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper, we have affected 1074 of 1100 schools, which have been affected by the disaster until December 2016, which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction is far more difficult in the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 per cent of fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi have now been in operation, only 30 percent of fishing ports have been re-recorded.</seg>
<seg id="563">Tsunami and the atomic accident have moved in the three prefectures of agricultural land large area.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of the arable land in Iwate and less than 50 per cent destroyed the farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a result of the atomic fact, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed the farmland area of Fukushima, lying in the "nuclear war zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, the tourism again recovers again, but again Fukushima still remains unbeaten.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are again up to 90 percent in the same stand as before the misfortune. Fukushima joined the same stand here only 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shanno Newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it was as difficult to earn their habitat.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine a total image, the newspaper conducted numerous surveys under the native population and under the evacuation of the evacuation. it also asked them about the state of rebuilding and also how their indignation gets changed over the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In the introduction of the article, Kahoku Sheno Newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shanno led a survey carried out in order to bring more about the tsunami awareness among the native population in experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey carried out that 83.1 percent of local residents have taken their actions to be prepared on future earthquake and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents say that still not enough in the stuff of catastrophes had been done.</seg>
<seg id="575">As to those who are evacuated from the prefecture of Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue to the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper has strengthened its attention even on the location of evacuated Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had not only to experience the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also witness of the worst, disastrous consequences, nuclear accident, who ever had to experience Japan.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuated from Fukushima almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside of the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, some more than 23 000 people were moved back to Fukushima, in permanent spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the 2017 stand there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">Most of the evacuated areas are most of the evacuation, who still have to be back in the right accommodation, because the efforts for the rebuilding of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. here is the building projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will be held in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">If people meet people from other countries that speak a different language, the differences appear to be bigger than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">However, after a while, however, you often know that one more connects than it appears to the first glance.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important because they will make out our advantages, our perspectives broaden and remember that the world finally is very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices of Podcast, we look at exactly these global links. in our Into the Deep Podcast, we will treat topics that they often get fewer attention than they earn.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who recall a moment where they have felt very strongly connected with someone about language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veronika Kriconi speaks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Toreta Camarasa reminds about the time where they worked with people from all over the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences which he collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, studied social sciences at the Federal University of Goiás, has suffered a skull-trauma and several fretions.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors took him on this Saturday and then put it into a artificial compass.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local photo journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus which quickly spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures there is also the face of the police officer, which was identified with a stroke attack. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police announced in the Brazilian state of Goiás that Sampaio was suspended until the investigation of the investigation of the active service was suspended.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officer, as he performs in Goiânia with his impact on the face of students Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">It would be a police officer from a demonstrators and landing on the intensive care station, his face would be seen for six months in television and the entire repression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desnealizador," a press channel of media activists from Goiânia, divided by Luiz da Luz, distributed by Luiz da Luz, where one sees, as Mateus is attacked by the police officer and several sanitary shortly afterwards to it.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes, but from a different perspective, is also immersed in the social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the below shown clip you can see the attack on Mateus from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the Mateus family who lives in another state of state, Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian Reais (about 2,700 euros) to cover a part of the costs for medical treatment and to stay in Goiânia while he is in the hospital.</seg>

<seg id="612">On Facebook, Professor Pablo Ortellado calls another nonviolence against activists in Goiás:</seg>
<seg id="613">Goiás experienced a wave of political power: here, the activist Guilherme Irish of his father was murdered; and here we have been attacked the very sad school of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who has been attacked by a policemen who has beaten him with a strike in his face.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police overhandles</seg>
<seg id="615">Goiás was not the only state in Brazil in which it came to protesters in the past Friday.</seg>
<seg id="616">Policemen trained at the protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators had prepared a stage for Redner, Gummigrade and Tränengas.</seg>
<seg id="617">Member of Flavio Serafini, Social and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police to renounce violence against demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="618">This also includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, the Brazilian media road protested by making the focus on another, unexpected protagonists, a window plate.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de S. Paulo and estado de S. Paulo reported a target of a broken glass windows to illustrate with a photo its title pages illustrative.</seg>
<seg id="621">In contrast, the O Globo wrote a title story with a fire on fire.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic foundation, more about a broken window plate as about the protests of thousands of people who serve the defence of a special thing to report.</seg>
<seg id="623">This must be seen also if you are stripe against any type of damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here also, the term "Vandalism" is a absurd, disproportionate, and the typical violent actions of the military police are marked by headlines with the title "demonstrators" at the confrontation course with the police. "</seg>
<seg id="625">The forgotten villages in Cuba from the discoveries in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso used almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The Congregation Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, who is located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is widely known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - known, regardless of that there is no nenness sugar spot on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago, when the activities were fabricated in the sugar tube factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After that, the sugar tube industry stood still in the region, and the factory lost after and after its installations, until only the rumor of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">Approximately 272 workers had to reinvent itself.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changes the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Other resigned and commutes daily to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a solo veteran, which rises every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar tube industry does not produce his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He listened to that in the eastern region of the region of sugar rubber factories, which are again in operation after a long intimate time, because they have been preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something that he was not expected.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene is reminiscent of the fact that in Mañalich would receive the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar tube industry is already the plagues, the case of socialism, the low market prices, the Ineffefficiency, the bad administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, the production of 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the 1910 produced.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motive for decades before some decades, but the poor earth have already been no rejection anymore.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was Cuban sugar tube industry turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old rail stiff of the congregation saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reinforcement of the sugar tube industry was an economical solution: the 155 sugar tubes factories were technically obsolete, and hardly competitive for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They just left the factories which can produce sugar for maximum 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motifs that led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar tubes and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price increased again about one decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 report, "Landwirtschaftssperspektiven" from the OECD and FAO, the Agricultural and Food Organization of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar level would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not all ran well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "the present day will enter in history" "" "the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the Sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From there, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, a total of 98 sugar tubes produced, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">It was the same thing in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez has been working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene is known as a soldier, on the closure of the factory, the word that he is repeated most repeated, "fraud."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order to receive the place, they were a full time - Working Group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first shot year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">In order to be officially written documents relating to the parts that would be removed, the address and the date are distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could overtake any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">Since then, the responsibility and letters came always more common.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the lactating factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the still used sugar cane factories."</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, is waiting for the pension in another facility, Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was in charge of his will at the disclosure of the factory in which he helped to participate.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part that he was removed, he was dismantled in one of his 31 working years.</seg>
<seg id="668">The best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important workplace producers was removed out.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, there were no alternatives to work stations and services provided by the plants in the congregations where they were created.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know if during the mammoth address given to the eyes of 21 October 2002, then President in the eyes of the present people saw that for those areas, whose factories were not in operation for five years, everything would run well.</seg>

<seg id="674">After two years, the People's Gregorio Arleé Mañalich learned that many things will change, but not always to better when a factory is closed.</seg>
<seg id="675">When the sugar tube factory was completed, or better, when they began to disclose them, they also listened to asphalt roads, they also partakers other farms.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with advanced age, Nene and Eddy other factories had to seek.</seg>
<seg id="677">They have been added to spare parts.</seg>

<seg id="692">Youths of the First Nations communities in all Canada are related to topics that are important for them. do they do through Hip-Hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour will bring home theater studios directly to schools and youth centres, for youth groups Songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live appearances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the pedagogues David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and in Nord-Quebec with ten cree communities and then with the Cree Hip-Hop-group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop is thus increasing that the young participants in discussions related issues such as "cultural identity, language, struggles, love, self-acceptable, or whatever it occurs in the sense.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos, where young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team worked together with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the trunk of the Winevago in the US state Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'Yoo, in the field of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First nation in British Columbia, is known for example the history of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," in the almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>

<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First nation recorded, the refrain is sung in Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people received some help by Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip-Hop Group, who gave them a strophe in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">At the facebookpage of N'we Jinan stands the strophe in writing, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see almost any restaurant of plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what exactly will be on the menu, are in the vicinity of the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (in the buckets, "Plastic models of dishes") which will be served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers check out these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or pass through.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry that is dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the tokioter district Kappabashi there is a variety of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes created by the German filmmaker Wim Wenders in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">Most Japanese are these plastic dishes as usual that they are not even more refusing to them. however, a new trend is transformed into conspicuous cell accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome, the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos to show this unusual twist with the shokuhin.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new with plastic grated mobile bands, as they are shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu Kaufhaus.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been changed to kitten collector, as in this case, refrigerator magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few shootch coolers for a new exhibition in Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of essence is increasingly sophisticated.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, an imperial-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was transformed into a mobile phone support.</seg>
<seg id="730">For these triangular bowl (lol) we found as a mobile phone support a good use.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is a apple, which can hold your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like a apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that's only the beginning of an increasing flight.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone support and mobile designers allow you to produce your own artwork. in this case, ikura or salmon was used, a popular topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">If there would be someone who say, "Wow, cool, now I can feel my mobile phone with salmon?"</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes may also accept a less appetite form, for example colleagues or family members unpleasant to surprise.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone support has the shape of melting the ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are rice balls (onigiri), earrings and wristbands from dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Other skurrile plastic dishes can view yourself under: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter The hashtag # 4.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trends, then this video gives you an insight into the Kappabashi district, which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry. like for example with shokuhin-purple.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of in- and foreign media over the notorious "struggle against drug trade" in Mexico, the misery and cheers are regularly used in statistics. however, these reflect not the extent of the human tragedy against that fight against this battle.</seg>
<seg id="750">The reporting on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the boss of the Sinaloa cartridge, pressed the stories of the conflict entirely in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">A day after a violent incident looks hardly any man looking upon the tragedy or to the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind each strip, behind every bone refunds in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds may never heal.</seg>
<seg id="753">Therefore, the Mexican news portal of the Animal Político is the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "dealing with the drug trade"), that these victims shall give a voice and stories of people who were talking about the battle between the prosecution authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">The Animal Político describes the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organizational crime does not allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The impact are much deeper.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, if shops close because they are threatened by drug traders and whole communities have to drive many kilometers to buy something as milk as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the Victims</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "a video with the title" Vidas que cambian por el miedo "" "" (german: "like fear of life" "" ") tells exactly these stories." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches every weekend secret graves after his son.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost their father, four siblings, her husband and two of her nephew.</seg>
<seg id="762">Priest: "as every Sunday we prepare for us today again the task of looking for us to get rid of the graves after the people who loved us."</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is called Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>
<seg id="766">He worked in an electric store in El Naranjo.</seg>
<seg id="767">On October 13 he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">On October 15th he should be back again, but he never returned. Emma Veleta: "it is very difficult for me because I am now with three children who need a training.</seg>
<seg id="769">There is also my mother who is also here with me.</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment she has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">You will receive the insurance of my father, but they won't pay it out, because they ask a death certificate.</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get that? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el narco," why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We must not only show the faces of those that are anxiety. we must show the international community the conflicts to show the smoothness and the state of the state.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reading of animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in Central Europe.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I've been aware of the disease and Sensational journalism for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come to newspaper kiosks every day and see the title pages with pictures which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from Akten of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me from the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I have the feeling when I am the only thing that I gged or sad. it acts as a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can not be equal, or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10 year old cousin wants to become Narco (German: drug dealers) if it is great. and it is not normal that people listen to the "Helours" of the offenders "when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me, this is what would they have lost to those who have lost someone and those who have fear them so something happened.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness, if stories are to be naked numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The facts of human beings is incredible for me when the death of six people and the enforced disappearances of 43 students in a neighboring resort to be justified. "</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to talk that they are spared by such tragedy if they are not stirring and still.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four Months to be spoiled in the capital city: like a family with droplings," it describes how armed crime month was pressed for month money from their business until they had not only destroyed the store, but also her family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think all that you have lost and remember how some people can change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain perverse over it, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again, when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers also.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">Depending on the other, we are better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She finished her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"" "" "" "we want to be arrested, because they don't know when they will lead you or kill." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked for myself in these fearful days, if weeping would have lifted up my deepest feelings, but the answer is no, for I forgot to learn how to weep. I must learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation of violence.</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he gave questions on how: who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crimes?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement at the edge of the most dangerous town of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age whose parents take care of her.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a fatherless and he tells that he had to bring together a egg, potatoes brils, tortillas, and "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of flacon with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left Bone - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, one told him that his mother disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day that his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years before, when he was only a few blocks away from his home, the bloody dead bodies of his father was shot, who was shot by armed men from a vorced car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, when violence through organized crime and struggle against the already existing social problems mixed in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of Morde according to the number of civil council for public security and government of the government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the Public Prosecutor of 3103 Morde. this corresponds to average 8.5 Morden per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are only a few hundred thousands of stories that invading the organized crime in Mexico, and enter into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only few stories live in view of the new headlines. this project reminds us of those who are not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" project, Animal Político has set up the data journalism project Narcodata, whose aim is to set the complex information behind the failed fighting against the drug trade, which has peeled the country in the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="818">The fact check is important at a moment in which it comes to raise a rumor or fake a fake.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the years after something the first time emerged? content in social media, whether it is true or untrue, tend to continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident 7 years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication it has been used irreinstreate, tragedy that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false copy of pictures and event - "false description" or "false context" in terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - denied not the fact that there is plenty of careful report on events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it throws questions about our desire to find pictures.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010 a tankers crossed the place Sange from the East of the DR Congo, tiled and exploded. 230 people died.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa had been neglected in the second largest country for years. the streets in the region have become dangerous strokes full of strokes, which were difficult to walk.</seg>
<seg id="827">The tank remains to the victim of the tank.</seg>
<seg id="828">Government representatives described a fireball, the dozens of houses, including a cinemas close, which was full of people who illustrate the football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses violated and stolen bodies were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="831">An image with the title "This is Nigeria." from Imgur users Mystical Monkey, 12. January 2015.Several photos of the incident form the gray scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of dark body, which coblows on the ground for people to watch them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not find her end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years it became the same photo several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, however, real but not in connection of the tragedy, particularly events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What and what does not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, the fighters of the Boko Haram attacked the unlegeneric villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Augenzeugen reported drastically of atrocities, they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies were burned in streets and bones.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "the numbers could not be confirmed but" "" "nobody remained back to count the bodies," "" "said a population on Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were zumped, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only using satellite images the follow-up could be illustrated.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack remained uncertain, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the Military Nigerias and the attempt of Boko Haram, country to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the image taken out of the DR Congo again, as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this misses use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of failure; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the image was introduced as a letter for mass graves.</seg>
<seg id="852">Another step further bring personal comments like this example deplating the image from the DR Congo with the sources of mass media in connection to supply arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange came also in conjunction with the fatal persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash message, the United Nations describes those who were able to flee rape and some dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported from violence against the Rohingya, Posts reported that these descriptions made with photos from the DR of Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an acidi-Arab News page, who claimed 2012 failed to participate in the assassination of the Rohingya Muslims, in addition to the assassination of the Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from the DR Congo to illustrated this information.</seg>

<seg id="861">Using a "inverted picture search" you can see how far more information can be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="862">A converted picture-search with the search engine TinEye has found 344 images under 18.8 billion images (as of May 3, 2017), which are similar to the illustrated picture from the DR Congo.</seg>

<seg id="909">This message claimed that the President of Myanmar Thein was claimed that the monks and politicians have been involved in the killing of Rohingya Muslims, and brought the story together with the picture from Sange.</seg>

<seg id="912">This article of 2014 about students who were recorded by the Boko Haram has been published, published by the Catholic University of Análisis Digital, has explicitly stated that the picture was not taken by the Töttle, but it claims that it is a "similar dutch-distic assault."</seg>
<seg id="913">When the picture later seen in connection with the massacre of Boko Haram from 2015 in circulation, the newspaper El Pais tried to contradicate these connections to Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="914">Turkey, 2015. "# NijeryaYanıyorfertilizers yaUyuy" (Nigeria burns, the world sleeps).</seg>
<seg id="915">The image of the DR Kongo appeared with this Twitterhashtag, and dissolved a discussion among Muslims after the massacre of Boko Haram 2015 and the stop on Charlie Hebdo in Paris.</seg>

<seg id="918">The picture was pushed as a letter to the massacre of Boko Haram 2015 (and more than 9,300 times). but the messages that were associated with it were taken in no religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the goal was to judge attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media reports compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Hebdo.</seg>

<seg id="926">In all these cases, which has been published only after the original accident of 2010, the picture finally carries a correct description but the original contribution is not available or accessible.</seg>
<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two powerful topics or frames (frames), which are going through this post. the first frame focus on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in terms of greater discussions about the silence in connection with the exhortation of Christians by Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the exhortation of the Rohingyas through Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second Framing uses the image to discuss how a African life is assessed compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion understand and the value of human life is both important. therefore it is worthwhile to examine how images are used in connection with this effort.</seg>
<seg id="932">But a deeper question is, however, what happens if reading this pictures doesn't need longer faith.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are only people who have unintentional share of water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggerated this mood of the failure and false information that the actual atrocities are unreal and tastes the real cracks of what actually happened in the DR Congo, in Nigeria and in Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The dissemination of forcible images has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">An argument is that the retention of images of a refusal comes to recognize the tragedy. sometimes, these images are even required by the victims.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time the concern is that the forcible images of readers and audience will take the ability to feel Empathy (such as such a study that sought how forcible media to work, others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot of forcible representations in the news media, fact that they are indispensable for today's news report.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists have experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake news." they will thoroughly consider thinking about the situation in which a picture should have been replaced, but also replaced by the context or completely violate species.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, any examination should be considered internationally, however, should also be considered internationally.</seg>

<seg id="943">Photo of Andy Simmons uses CC BY-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="944">A blog with the name Untranlatable (e.g. untranslated), language enthusiastic a selection of words from all over the world, which are difficult or not to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words are in any language: you are certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these unmistakable words are already well known today (like the famous Portuguese acid) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example, the Spanish sodomesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist persistent every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not sufficient, why a full explanation and sometimes something context is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for a full time in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, during the author and Linguist by "Untranslatable" Steven Bird, to concentrate on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">For example, in the blog you can find words from the Vanuatu Vanuatu, like:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Bemüh yourself for your parents in recognition of what you have laboured in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunswick Language which are spoken in parts of Brazil, like:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - the ease of comfort or sloth, which one feels in cold days in the sun.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words out of his blog About:</seg>
<seg id="956">They escape other cultures, reveal another Gedankets and weave our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes, consider how we analyze the world around us and classify the Linguists on this page still want to show more of these "untranslated" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are.</seg>
<seg id="958">Redner of the "Treasure Languages," which are very appreciated by Untranslatable are invited to invite their favourite words here.</seg>

<seg id="1132">We have to present themselves uncomfortable questions, after the role of what my girlfriend and I believe in the rain during the Women's March, because the occupation that we do not have a president, the chocolate cake is bombed during which he had already capitalized countries and "to others" people, goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to enter here and now in spite of a language barrier with someone in connection?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, the founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) is an answer of stories in their original language.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported short about another initiative by Steven Bird, the Unveiled Blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">This is, however, the focus of TLS is not written on the written but in the spoken word. it is an attempt to obtain the language diversity of great cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">Indeed, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already been conducted since 2015, the risk that little and not all so small languages are not given to any children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">The project is valid for the makers of the Project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided when we have cities to accept the diverity - safe areas where people don't forget to be in order to be.</seg>
<seg id="1143">During "listening often, this is often connected to understand these events instead," the listeners, to appreciate, to do. "</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, hists represent their story initially in their own language and translate or explain it in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are no professional storyteller, their devotion and their depiction that the audiences can be found on it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughter and emotions, than be the language no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">For example, the following video shows a traditional history dating from Burkina Faso, which will be told in the language Dafing. during this round, the history of Rassidatou consulate also the opportunity to explain the country of typical customs of laws.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamusara tells the fabel of bunnies and the Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After he asked the meaning of his wrist, John Nyamusara asked: "how is it to talk to an audience, which will not understand your language?" with a wide grassy, he divides his feeling of content:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have heard!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">To date, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling took place in three cities, and the organisers hope to expand this. all those who are inspired by the project can compete with TLS in order to organize their own history teeth.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian Web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, is missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Over five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and members leave the campaign for his freedom and reminiscent of the contributions which he made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: PUBLICA, the annual conference on digital Culture held annually in Berlin, dedicated to the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist who produced in France-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, Managing Director of Book sprints' finished books within three to five days, lases excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Insured (The Costs of Freedom: a collective post-research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book that was published last year and here is licensed under, contains a number of inserts that deal with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction, it is:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to identify how movements for free knowledge and what the true costs are, with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activist, artist, designers, developer, researchers and authors that are involved in movements for free knowledge have been working on page to view over the nebula which gives our newsfeeds and create something from our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was knitted from the directory of the Adra prison, which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then we have no information about his current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice who want to release his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us let us start over their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we today here?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we decide?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we abandoned in this process of timely extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer of Open Source and Digital activist has been in prison for Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015 Bassel was transferred from Adra prison, a non-military institution, to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer in Noura Ghazi reported that the "military police bases on the basis of a" strictly secret "was taken away from the Military Court of his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she was contacted by persons on November 12, 2015, who had committed themselves to his husband himself as the Insider of the Assad government.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His residence and condition remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in which to extend the Internet and knowledge of knowledge to the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist, and currently the leader of the new Palmyra, a project, founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps there was none of Bassels cultural prototypes, as the work which he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archeological sites in the world, was the signs of numerous civilian populations, and here are Greek-Roman architectural types with hiesous traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel could not know that ten years after being started working with this work, the IS would be everything that it would not only be the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world embodies out.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip is created in the digital archaeology and the conservation has created a time capsule which will be the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of invaluable value.</seg>
<seg id="1211">The base of this project could not yet unlock this project.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband, his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my whole life to dream of freedom to dream and bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel gave me English, even when he was already in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read English and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He always has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he has taught other indemnity to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened my gate to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He has also brought other indemons as they use computers, at least theoretically, without knowing that they actually held one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (waiting), a trial which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015, when he was in detention.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She tasted the lyrics to him if they visited him and he translated them from the Arab in English.</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mosambique: sentenced to previous post-handed charge because of corruption</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mosambience responded with anger on a corruption, where a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is a Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants because of imperation of 54 million metikal (about 800 000 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds in the airports of Mozambique, the Council of Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately asked his return to the company, which took place on 19 April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement of the General Attorney of the Republic, which impaired the application, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza, back to his old post, since the company had no discipline in detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many residents are not good.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), a local institution which concerns itself for public transparency, sentenced in an interview with the German Wave's decision to introduce the company's decision:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Provides a setback in the fight against corruption and inexplicit the absence of transparency and is even a step in regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we have to know, that also the company would have to lead a discipline against the contradicating process.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company kept silence, however, there is no appropriate legal steps to use the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mosambique social media, rejects this behaviour as well as "conflicting":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza would be a competent type, he would be adviser when he was sentenced to prison in prison, and half of it has been canceled.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could pay lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polishing his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">"" "but as he is incompetent, he has approved to become reintegrate into the company, which he saved damage." ""</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Resistible!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mosambience and student of Political Science in Brazil says, the director had no morals:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state, because he invaded it, I cannot believe that one has rewarded someone in such a way that the state has already claimed so massively.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing the morals and the state to serve as he had already been a unique opportunity to serve the state, but only himself served by the state instead.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza was used the state, when handwritten it to an inexhaustible money source and the state itself is tired of this man who was loaded and finally sentenced to a long sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte is preferred to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Mahel to remember that a thief belongs to the prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison of Samora Mahel, not only for ever as the first independent president in memory, but also as a scarlet, cutting and - by side - Prophetic Redner.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations, when he was energetically confirmed that "an ambitious man is to be able to sell his own individual interest, his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora said: "I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that it is not so. he changes the tactic, but he does not change over his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious man is a crime time. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter the reactions were also rejected:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment, he sat 10 years and came free.</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users</seg>
<seg id="1287">The burial word "Kalar pae" means Kichererbese or Spaging blows.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo of Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to information on Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took her post from the net, because they abstained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although over the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to assign people to East Indian origin or general as an adjective. "</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook is licensed by the word" "" "Kalar" or "" "(in German text) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread issue of Hasselt in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">Over the last few years, the ascent of radical nationalistic movements gave the word an extremely abrasive heronnation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra-nationalists as Hasselt, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in the effort to fight Hasselt in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of sensual content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar'mag today may usually be associated with racism, but the word in itself does not call automatically Hasselt.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that too, in which they have discussed the use of the word or have brought in doubt for the use of his usage, censored:</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several burial words with basic different meanings that have the same book sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair will also be written on Burmese even 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as also as other words like 'Kalar pae' (Spage), 'Kalar oat' (Kamel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Faceboocytic Aung Kaung Myat declared the various meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">One post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends about the rich species, if they knew how he could alleys his back pain by playing a vocal game.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The proposition Ku la - "Healing" (Ku) + the Frageword (la) to Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win is the opinion that they will reduce Hasselt's radically nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook analytic needs to spread out all post-hoists in suspicion, racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "the word" "" "Kalar" "" "is not manually operated." ""</seg>
<seg id="1306">It automatically filters the Word.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The Automism will not understand what you write on factions.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What to make it instead, is the post carefully to analyze and check it by check the words out.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (drills).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good is that these dreamed nationalists who spread Hasselt, a rather good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it's time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action can send a strong signal to everyone who hate Hasselt, the efficiency of this strategy does not hold long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have demonstrated that the censorship of strokes often have a cat- and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks will simply start to use a new word or alternative writing of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to erase his postal, when he wanted to divide his friends, that the word 'Kalar' was banned by the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was attentive to this new directive on Facebook, I made a post to announce my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my mail has been removed from Facebook and it was prohibited for 24 hours, because the post "Facebook community standards was not said."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of postcards from people who have no negative intentions or just trying to show their opinions against Hasselt's radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post has been removed, who has nothing to do with Hasselt:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without Hasselt by Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post the author divided his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism are badly in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook would have to do more before the beginning of the initiative, for example, the burmesan Internet community asked advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a beneficial intention to reduce racism in Burma by their platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">To cate such words, even more hatred within the different communities will bring it.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it seems, as if they have started without a local context or technical support, and as words as "chair" or "Gensencurry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they did not have bugs, they didn't tried to report the wrong postage.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only a bit more respect for the 15 million benefit, they would have a great turnover, would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has ensured much fun among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of serious, users now do well-fun and write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of Hasselt to see if their postcards are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook Posts, which had no Hasselt, but nevertheless removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">With permission used.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmian text is "I want to sit on a chair and watch the peeling curry and watch a Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just to try out if Facebook contains the mail, which contains the word Kalar. "</seg>

<seg id="1334">"" "" "" "If you are a doctor, do you cure people?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious findings have been used to have social networks to expand their voices and their influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, Hasselt should preheat the violence in the municipalities in Myanmar, especially in Rakhine area, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists were forced to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was criticised for his failure, who would have to prove themselves on his Burmese pages under control.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But rather than just to cate the word 'Kalar', it would have better ongoing, rather than on the context of concentrating initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill for children before the House of Representatives was approved at the House of Representatives with 35 votes.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After having decided in the Senate, the draft may now be to the law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were thrilled because the laws have been changed to children before finally.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, which was covered by a ministerial office in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has been too much time and unnecessary Gerede, which has swallowed up the core of the cause, but do you know what? the child is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now, and that's worth every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson, it was definitely enough to finish the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was happy that the day was finally come:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public status update on Facebook by Lara Quentre - Thomas, which says:, Excellent news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The Ehegesetz has been decided.</seg>

<seg id="1366">The married age in Trinidad and Tobago now amounts to 18 years independently of religion.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The design for the change of Ehegeses was adopted today, on June 9, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">In the House of Representatives there are 41 members and of which 35 were present at the voting.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All members of the accused were approved for the law.</seg>

<seg id="1374">A Danke to our MEPs.</seg>
<seg id="1375">But a possible hook occurs in the form of Sat Maharaj, the Secretary-General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu-Organisation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Before months, Maharaj has announced his intention to commit judicial steps, should the law be adopted, and he seems to redeem his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">During the General State Attorney, Al rawi, a supporter of the law, thought it would be quite rightly when Maharaj would like to proceed against the law, the most social media users would be challenged differently.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell proposed:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we, instead of talking about the discussion, in a way that we would like to say, instead of the problem, that the state, our daughters from before, could say that they may be abused by major, hard-tends men who are misused to them, would you be willing to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you believe that there is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But whether it comes to a judicial proceedings against the law, or not, these legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where the children's rights are legal or still the standard, although there are laws that they say.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia page was shown on 18 January 2012, to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA Copyright Act in the USA, internationally distorted.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">Since more than a month, Turkey has now closed the popular and on the crowdsourcing principle-based enzyme clopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day for Tag is clear how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporter and fans of TV series runs against the pless.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many techniques are used to use envelopes tools for blocked websites (an earlier article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has not the third largest VPN prevalent in the world), the most common Wikipedia users will not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been locking since 2008 by Wikipedia, as recently published in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University will find regular blocking of the Internet since 2007 after the Internet Act (No. 5651) has been adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it goes around the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains closed, there are now several Mirror pages (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and often are frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) as the platform all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized Peer-to-peer network (i.e. computer machine connections), which is not based on the system of domain names and therefore a complete censorship is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content of the content is decreable despite the prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blogpost, IPFS about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After having heard the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we were all going to push the snapshots of Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. this is the possibility to read the content on decentralized and distributed mode.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This may help users to see at least all Wikipedia contents, even if they can't reach the website www.wikipedia.org itself.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step is independent of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it only works for screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consoli of Wikimedia in Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopä.org, a Mirror page of Wikipedia, as well as WikMirror, an open source project that everyone can take advantage of similar Mirror pages when in the respective country Wikipedia is closed.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consoli reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices and assistants at the Panigrahi's Open Manifesto "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a Mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">One gets to another URL that is not the original. that what you see then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially the server guides the request to the right Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself, if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is executed by a server which is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1418">The motivated to carry him a camera and try to grab the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Then he was a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sans, Neptune, endeaved to bringing Nepals to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his native place directly next to the Chitwan National Park, it offers the perfect opportunity to shoot photos on Nepals wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook as it helps to help him with his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of the Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just wondered at home, when I suddenly called Navaraj (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge), he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rapti river was a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I left with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the Leopard was found and I immediately began to knee images!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">It is a collaboration with the authorities to obtain global recognition for Nepalas Nature and would like to understand the understanding of understanding that wild animals are not so furious, as they look like.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, because he had already made tigers on face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can't hide from the opinion of the sheep in sleep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">I also was due to the darkness in the way home, when suddenly the king of the Buheks appeared. he is immediately going on, we see and starred me through the Sal-Trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">In order to promote the protection of wild animals, Sans placed the logo "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I click on environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">But his passion for the promotion of Nepalas nature and wild animals is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and often lived in a tent to take up in Bardia National Park shots of Otter. up to 12 days it lasted until he took a tiger, and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist information.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This post has been posted by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally based on Video Volunteers, an award winning international community organisation from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was re-published here as part of a content Sharing Convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India there are women with greatest care, the names of their husbands, or even from older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead, they use a ponomen or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chuisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect the husband because of the social pressure of the husband, and the fear of consequences they should misuse the norm, this practice in practice.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was sentenced from the Indian state of Oboa by a military court and cast off their family and the village community after having responded to a secret figure on behalf.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition their wives also did not call on name, is also common among men. however, they are far from less assignments, if they all, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health staff as well as household women, a unique club and were therefore fast to the main discussions about the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place just for them only to discuss the hostesses of the Patriarchate and discuss.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs, which is in 13 Indian states, it is part of the campaign # Khelbadal, which is operated by the Community's video Volunteers and set itself for the degradation of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paine has been working for seven years with the help of their video camera to the discovery of practices, such as children's marriage to the Verbanness of HIV- and AIDS Infested, and leads those sepubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports about how this clubs created a safe place for those women and made them at the same time for ambassadors of the wall.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini showed up in its discussions, did not name women who call their husbands in their names.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided for this subject, because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with whom the women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not according to the names of their husbands, a roar is to be found guilty and never charged them in question.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini believes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman who respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who doesn't keep it, is watched as a woman without Moral.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted, that we have never made up to this discussion round thoughts.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini wanted to have never seen her husband's name so far as it is running at home.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and mother in law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother in law and my husband were still long after the video had ended.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned back to me, saying, I should call him now on his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in Baggage, Rohini started their first discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" never before. some believed that it was a good cause because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After video projection, the women tried to bring the discussion with a exercise in gear.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Raw ini asked every participant in the name of her husband with various feelings - happy, annoying, lovingly, lovingly and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then asked them all, "If we are not able to tell us the names of our husbands, but they can call us how they want us not respected?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it be equal to it? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when she brought the name of her husbands on her lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra over the breaking of a year-old tradition, in which married women may never speak to their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that during the whole exercise just before moving; another decided to leave the entire frustration against him and his family by allowing it to curse him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was static.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Even in the Adrenalinlet about that, with an ancient roasting, the women decided that they would actually try to call her husband to name their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next days, Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini, and asked what ideas put her in the head: his wife could not stop his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another Klubic member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When she had her mother in law she was afraid, she was afraid, and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said: "Rohini meant that I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant in less understandstill and the situation arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reported how women attempted to stop other practices, such as the Traction of the red point at the forehead, which shows the Ehestatus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband, I would bear the least red point when he did it.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I heard it, to bear him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely ceased, but mine, they are now in a better position, even to choose it in some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we make a tour with every discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we packed lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">I don't want to make sure that women could make, who could hear, "says she.</seg>
<seg id="1522">During the last months, they celebrated their own birthdays in their life with cakes. they danced, sang and talking about things that they had never had sex before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Raw ini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years, but I also have talking about some things, for example how our identities are associated to our husbands, never said so honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say certain things loud, no matter how small they occur one.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we have talking about the concept of honour and how it is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have borne only Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most of them is okay, but some of them wanted a salescta, a large shirt over a trousers, they have not taken.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of strife and discussion about the advantages of the own hanger, the morals connected to the Saris and much more, decorate Rohini her own pair of curtas (Oberhemden) in a discussion round, so that women could carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they have now decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear Jeans and Rohini is sure that they can create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"" "on the question whether in the five months since their first discussion club has already changed something, Rohini confirms that things are slowly coming into rolls:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have done just little steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a couple of times, but they listened to say the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, me included, do it yet, but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two will continue to do the names of their husbands; only one or two women have now wear Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to reach in their lives - like the line of movement or the own hanger selection - at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In order to give yourself mutual confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a sacrifice of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives everyone of us the confidence that will change something.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction, if every woman goes home after home and other people, what we speak, and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, which was probably made recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published in the context of a partnership agreement with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of prisoned Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo has drawn attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized for liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (state risk) after he calls for the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto which claims the democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has called" "" "an internal matter" "" "and a narrator, he told it as" "" "not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China still receives views from the international community, Nobel Prize-Laureate and his wife, Dichterin Liu Xia, to allow for a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the Paares in Beijing, others are completely destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarized some reaction from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights, met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment if the United Nations should exert pressure to allow Liu to make a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brings have refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came into stores after the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 was awarded to Liu, although the Norwegian government had ceased that this ultimately has nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were only continued in December last year. only in June, Norway signed an agreement to restore the salmon travels to China, since the exports have been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the message had spread that Liu was seriously injured, the Nobel Committee brought his hope to an unconditional release of expression and invited Liu to catch his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his detention, he was not able to meet his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">Liu was represented by an empty chair during the ceremony.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a decision on which China was asked to free Liu and his wife immediately from the house arrest and to allow himself to search for medical support, where he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top establishment of the EU, Federica Mogherini called for China to release Lius, as she divided in an explanation on June 30:</seg>
<seg id="1649">We wait at the same time that China lifts all restrictions of Lord Lius wives as well as family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They shall meet all the visits and receive them who wish to communicate and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>
<seg id="1651">USA</seg>
<seg id="1652">U.S. Ambassador Terry Branstad divided that Americans have "him that he has the opportunity for the treatment abroad, if it is advisable to help him in his satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokesperson in the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the message AFP on the 27th of June that the embassy was sending the Chinese authorities to make free only Liu, but also his wife Liu Xia from their house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "the recess of the US Embassy moved to China, with the exterior of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, with the exterior of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs," "" "no land have the right to be" "" "no land" "" "on Chinese internal affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley divided that China should offer the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom, such as travel clarity and access to the medical care of his choice, which they are entitled to the Chinese constitution and legal system and international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz also introduced a decision in the Congress to allow the Chinese government to push on it, Liu and his wife unconditionally free.</seg>
<seg id="1658">I need to ask China to allow Nobel Peace Laureate # LiuXiaobo unconditionally, so that he may know in a proper medical treatment. http: / / bit.ly / 2tE6kU6kUo</seg>

<seg id="1660">On July 3, Berlin, Steffen Seibert wrote that Liu gets all the medical support that it needs "and that" "" "a" "" "humanitarian solution for Liu Xiaobo" "" "should be the highest priority." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1661">The Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources reported in Beijing of the News Agency Reuters that China had great concerns about whether the vertebrae could overlook at Liu in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, the Canadian Ambassador John McCallum, asked China to provide a reasonable medical care and to give it the opportunity to move from his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius lawyer told AFP previously, that Lius Mrs., Liu Xia could visit him every day, but the police always monitored the room in hospital, and that it is not permitted to talk with someone outside, including his lawyers, to talk and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum narrates:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada calls China to adopt its international human rights violations, including freedom of expression to maintain and allow for the exercise of these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's Ministry of Foreign Affairs referred to China in a declaration on June 29, to Liu for humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo has received all treatments which he needs, regardless where, needs. in addition, his wife and his family must have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Though the news of the news information already reported that the French government of Liu was welcome in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there are no further information that France would eventually take him.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of the landlords in Taiwan called for China on June 27, to Liu, allowing a greater tolerance towards those who require peaceful funds to request political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislature Yu Mei-nu passed by the regression of the Democratic Progress Party in China to allow to treat the sick intellectual property of Taiwan in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, showed herself in a declaration on June 28th for Liu, and gave that many him have asked him to pray for Lius Welfare.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that he had taken and had been unpunished for which he had been unpunished, more stable and wealthy China had helped to have contributed to a peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt personally moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected people are inspired by Liu Xiaobo, the charter 08 signed, which stands for democracy, freedom and law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may be stupid, since Singapore has been recognized as an independent state as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore was considered to be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the State Association of State of New York, the Minister, that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared to Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He undersupport that Singapore should be considered city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has put in question whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That is, whereby most people go a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice, "to turn the logic," to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and offerings to create this valuable country, we hear that we are no country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It was so vulgar, it had the certificate of a escape prior to the responsibilities, a mandatory weatherproof.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons mentioned by Shanmugam were not very Nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of which he appeared insoften.</seg>
<seg id="1699">However, on the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally among those cities that are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core point of the Thas, again the good old bodies of the authoritarian feasers will be back to be able to leave the democased logic, because it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the final week of Shanmugam the last week of Shanmugam was given answers to his American guests in our press, our Judicative, our political system really not-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Relevant issues cloaked with non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam on his opinion, since they didn't understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city is in which country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">Short, I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our new K Shanmugam would take the effort to clarify this point, if it was highly paid to be part of the government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By clicking on the blog his comment, he tells about the critics that you should start to read the entire co-copy of the conference, so that you could understand the context of statements by Shanugam better, according to which Singapore is a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the script.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore was rather a" "" "city," "" "he explained why the elections in Singapore would be so uneasy, even if we are looking for free and just" "" "elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He enjoys Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party win for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said, Singapore" "" "is not a land," "" "he doesn't know it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows its disappointment over Shanmugam, who makes an increasing generation, such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I have said about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said,...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde that awaits me - whether I agree with them or not, but this is a different thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes, really associated and being aware of what he defended.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review decomposes the weaknesses of Shanmugam Arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Did Mr. Shanmugam has committed an error, or was there an Freudscher reference?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we only considered independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">But if not, on which country the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore are back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is both country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the government of government, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious significance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do they have their military service to defend their military service, but they do not defend their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay our prime minister invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink Personalize?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">, tending the magazine Journey of a Decade for the reference, Singapore and was always a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I did not say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have many Singaporean injured...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one has ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We were always a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">I can understand that we often hear talking about "the defense of the country in particular" etc., but that's not quite true.</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should talk about the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series comes from Nevis Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>

<seg id="1786">Last month the Charlie-Chaplin-Video "Der dictator" was blocked in Thailand after a group of activist the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, inparticular as it keeps the situation in the country under the Junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Check out these recordings of the video that relate to some of the political themes, which have persecuted Thailand in the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The "44 rules of the girl" might refer to the draconical section 44 of the preliminary constitution, which is the commander in Chief of the Heeres absolute decision on important national topics.</seg>

<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the Junta has continued to purchase its decision to buy the subters of U-boats, although security experts had warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video it is even shown as people are thrown into a black delivery van before you bring them into an interchange camp, another problem.</seg>

<seg id="1805">It has been over 20 years now, since the Georgian-abchasian war officially ended, but his folds are still visible in this part of the republic.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The abandoned villages of northern district at Tkuarchal show distinctive pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1807">Villages like Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and Kharchilava are located in the hydrocarbons of Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups such as Russians, Greeks, deasies, Georgier and Armenians lived and worked together to Soviet times in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their houses during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today the largest part of Russians and Abchmarks are living in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called spirits in Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period more than 10,000 people lived here, today there are only a few hundred people in these spirits.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic for Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of 16.000 people had barely increased after one decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989 about 43,000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1894">In Mexico, "Mama Africa" houses migrants on their long journey</seg>
<seg id="1895">Concepción González Ramírez leads a small hotel in Tapachula, in the state of Chiapas, near Mexico City.</seg>
<seg id="1896">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on April 19, 2017 on the website of our Partners PRI.org and is published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America will be certain places for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, he is located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is directed by a 59- year old Mexican woman, a small woman with a corals of a corals of pink quartz frame and gold colored earring in teddy form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born there in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This top name is the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a goal for Afrikaner and Haitians who are on the journey.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For around 2,50 Dollar the night sleep in simple rooms, with grinding, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Haiti migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez is telling the people in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast to call them: "mom Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it's rather quiet but this year Ramírez already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept outside on cartons.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She does not want to reject it.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick, they bought these medicines that they cannot pay them, they massaged them with a balsam eagerly exhausted from the long voyage.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived at short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa is an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui, who has a Joghurtle) posia with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"" "" "" "yes, yes, he answered with a smile." "" "I really feel that there are very nice women in African women." ""</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very well here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to come to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They already lived in Brazil, however, it is for some Africans, who are on the way into the United States, normally a first stop in South America and go to the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard from other signposts of Mama Africa. "mom Africa is a well-known name on the route," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells us that the Haitians and Afrikaner often travel together the route and that the Africans were already talking to WhatsApp by Ms. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">As many of its signposts, Michelet has lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a building workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started its journey into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest in Mama Africa for months: it sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to get the Busticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he is in contact with Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"mom Africa is our Mother and we never leave it again," says he smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez tells us that her guests have often send text messages when they went to grate them or to report about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">It explains that her Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">They don't know much about Africa, but their guests have brought her to prepare chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. Ramírez is perhaps very well known, but it is not the only sparity hope for migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city, a Sackgasse leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter is Valenzuela and his family immigrants from their little house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policemen and has found that Bustickets are sold to numerous African migrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He began to help them to receive a reasonable price, he offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment, there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleeping on ceilings on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking area outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela declares that he knows what the guests make.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," says. "I have experienced what they experience.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others help. that's why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was transferred to the United States after a raid on his work.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels across Tapachula, comes from Central America, other residents open the doors of their houses for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children before men who wanted to kill him without a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for a accommodation and a well-known, a honouring, has offered him roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family lives there and they try to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back to the house of Mama Africa is all again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the aisles, the traveller are quiet their telephones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a majority from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs Ramírez seems happy about that her house is full, but she is nostalgically, because of those who have gone.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she shaken her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair bays that you made a spine, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sad, while she summed them shortly.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya is fucking," repeated every time. "they have already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang inhabitants are forced to install monitoring app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication tools in Xinjang from Twitter users of the Steel Station.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in the west of China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On 10 July, the mobile users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi received a mobile phone that shows the District government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the message it is said that the app" "" "will have access to terrorist information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities decided to use the app for more than fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to a exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture, because she had installed the app after they had replaced the app with a private wechat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the notification of the police, the app will determine the sources and the distribution routes of the terrorists and persecute, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information," including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs Website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service performance with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the blocking pornographic websites, by online guins, Troians and Phishing pages to make user attention to how much time they spend online, and to control the own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app includes filtering for minors to help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can naturally be used in a wide range of course.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote actors" state actors or even hackerable to manipulate the home network of one person to manipulate or out of it.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While announcements on digital censorship in China often focus on the experience of users in the bigger cities in the east and south, the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote, opted ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routinely Internet access.</seg>
<seg id="1976">This based on Twitter based Media Outlet "Images from Mountain China" (Germany), the censored news published in China, showed photos from a Checkpoint, on the policemen who would unchecked the inhabitants without any monitoring app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are discovered using a Checkpoint with a device without these software, they could be imprisoned up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a blow for the technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the recovery technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from the city of China" (Germany), also published a Jingwang product description, from which the software can raise the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus gets restricted access to the hard disk of the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installation of Jingwang, computers and cellphone in Xinjiang are available in Xinjiang.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The provisions in Jingwang are possibly a reaction to the instructions of the town-party Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal contents.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government agencies, authorities and related facilities including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the Direction of the Cybersecurity Office for operation of their computer and communication equipment.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report by Freedom House, an American Human Rights Organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang published the authorities on June 27 in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, a regulation related to all residents and entrepreneurs, up to 1 August their "personal ID cards, phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media storage cards" to register by local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">However, the intention is evident any "terrorist videos" to identify and destroy this promotion, however, the personality rights of Urumquis is three million inhabitants, giving them penalties for a whole range of other possible clubs, including such that relate to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2081">I decided to lay me back again; say we, that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">Some hours passed, which came to me like minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning bet.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The door opens and the morning light is filled with the room ".Raus with you, Arschficker."</seg>
<seg id="2085">I am answering the voice of an exhausted young people: "my lord, my father must make terrible worried."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"be quiet, and walk, thou shalt be moved."</seg>
<seg id="2087">That was new.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Otherwise they had always been released.</seg>
<seg id="2089">Where do they lead me?!</seg>
<seg id="2090">The jordan Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, free expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">This photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib takes the most part of his time in the inside of his time; and he cries on his screen to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on, there is a cigar between his fingers, or his nicotine lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top of his family house which had belonged to them since 1967; the year that Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank, and Hdaibs family had been forced to escape from their village in Palestine, which she had lived as felahyeen (about: farmers).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activity that the conservative majority was transferred and their well-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and free expression of opinion through art and rapmusic.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, often dealt with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian poultry, but also calls for the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics are not only in its hometown of Amman relevance, but also in cities which are from Damascus to the whole of Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">At the age of 25, Hdaib sees itself as a man who is not restricted by borders, and he can bring with people under the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Yemen and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if it does not open it, he swept up against the US-American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war areas, some of what was born in war areas - so he himself signifies himself, even if he was born in Jordan, and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think of my own life stands," stresses Hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think that I am a man, while he was dissolved in water in two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan; in this time it is intended for Muslims, from sunrise until sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law says that the public consumption of food is illegal during the Ramadan illegally.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Apparently, Hdaib has a certain weaknesses to break with ancient traditions. on the other hand, a cup of coffee is to do little with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the sleek shows delicious coffee and squadron of the kent cigarette in the nose to the first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the free sky, especially when you cast a look into the neighboring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">It is therefore simple to do basic things - how to drink in the public during Ramadan water - to finish in the prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordan was cancelled a gig of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some Parliament ordered that support the Islamic action against the Muslim Brotherhood - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual Frontiers Hamed Sinno, the cultural and traditional norms of the country contradict and the main reason for the Concert table.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MP and former press spokeswoman of the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert "just" because of sexual orientation of the prison was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many claim in addition to the commitment of the band in affairs like the Arab spring, human rights and free expression in the Arab world is more dangerous activism, which represents the old legitimacy of authorised legitimacy regimes in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimates the jordan people as "progressive support of human rights" which continued to use "for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is probably not easy to be confused Rhetork, but actually a clear crystalline reality reflected in Jordan, which occurs in Hdaibs plant.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib traditional gender standards came to body by giving his vision of the fate of Arabic women who have vorelieve sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a obviously low-known woman whose arms and legs are spread up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red sea; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who actually should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In Jordan the number of 'Honmoring' increased in Jordan - the inofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human Rights Watch according to its climax in 2016, the number of Honor in 2016 reached its peak; however, Jordan is still missing in order to support women who tried Mordes or domestic violence to support reasonable manner.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law to uninterruptions from 1954, women who are subject to incorporate violence, "to uncertain time in jail," and for their release is often a years of unbureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee provided by the family that the woman is done nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Even Hdaibs Music is pleased to announce great popularity and is well known to tradesmen that are in his country long as taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denying that his work is politically, of course, however, that he is his music, the full expirrelevant announcements on sexuality, freedom and expression, is not able to separate politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "" "" "has been declared policy," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song named "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes the question after the Palestinian identity in attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" Lawla al 3aib "" "" and "" "" Ghareeb "" "" is the focus on poverty. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are politically active in the core.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib released a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the songs Hdaib describes the world as a kind market, in which you can get to what you want, "it is faith or not believe, heterogenome or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that any one speaks in Jordan about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments about the equality of LGBTQ + -individuen still have been censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular jordan online programme Roya, in order to realize that his comments from the context, revolves and in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but it was only a modified version," says he.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib advertises the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that Intolerance did not promise to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentioned Abu nude, a poet of the eighth century, still remained in memory thanks to its homootic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nude should work once again on behalf of the Caliph, in the eighth century it could be open over homosexuality, why can Jordi not this?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, such as Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemic kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks on the free expression of opinion, and that progressive voices can be brought to silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian news service provided several former government members and members of the teaching association, with the reasons that they had been criticized on comments in social media to impose corruption associated with deeply in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of its, the Hdaibs show is only the top of the iceberg - the real challenge is to work with structural changes in the next generation of Jordi.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a permanent type and take away. Jordan has stopped for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - it looks like Hdaib - consists of slow, need and internal changes. it is sure that these changes from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs also, from an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He will not only dreams about his work until Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience "them."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region is aimed at the help of music, art and literature of a real and fundamental openness, and not by bombs, streaks and on artificial species of the democracies. at least, he hopes it.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is possible, hdaib is going to pass through and therefore also resist resistance.</seg>

<seg id="2178">Columbia: love letters to Guerillakfighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the modified version of the Beitrags "LiebesMessage to Guerilled warders," which has published international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">This post is published here in the context of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not yet more important, people who feel outgoing to hold affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Exactly this question was the two young Colombian activists of Leonardo Párraga by the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign cartas por la Reconciliación (letters to reconciliation), who encourage young people to write Guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, their country was the place of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part: after many long negotiations the Colombian government had closed a peace treaty with the GuerillaMovement FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), which forms the end of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was considered as important that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos offered the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits for the Nobel Peace Prize.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, in front of the column there is a long way until you can speak of a true reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla, who lived for many years in illegal camps, were exposed to a war rhetoric and carried out around the clock their weapons with themselves, to integrate into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, again, who had used the life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred against Guerillakfighters, these must now take into their ranks, and support them to build a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young columnans have to close together and help at the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And just this they did: until now, thousands of young people have written letters - Liebesmessage to former Guerillakage fighters to welcome them again in the company.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The campaign of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for each former Guerillakfighters - which then shall be handed in personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for reconciliation was created on the World Summit of Peace Laureate, who took place in Bogotá in February 2017, where Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk shortly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This declared that we love the people who love to write on Valentine's Day of thousands of love letters, but those who need to have much more needful.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He has said that he continued to share his love with people in this year, the most urgent issues.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus, the plan, letters of hope and support for former fighter of the FARC that now find their place in society and to build a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make discourse from a war history to a common history of peace."</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far more than 2000 letters were collected in the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I never thought that someone would forgive myself'</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on March 19 in one of the UN camp in Caldono-Cauca.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University Javeriana in Cali, two members of the town council of Cali and Leonardo from the Stiftung BogotArt reists to make letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC on how they had done it earlier to meet the commands of their leader.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no precepts, but letters filled with sub-based people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all parties. "it is incredible how many different feelings one can walk in just a few hours - from fear to luck and everything that is between," telling the political knowledge student Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governors of Valle del Cauca Province described this unforgettable experience as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After we handed over the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of Guerilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambook" (a kind of tent where the guerillakage fighters) saw, I saw a guerilled warder who wrote some.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I had afraid to go down, because in addition to him on the bed a MGL-pomegranates, a deadly weapon in the village.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I asked him," "" "hello, what are they doing?" "" "he said," "" "I answer a letter that someone wrote me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life any man has written me so nice, so do I answer you. I suddenly ran out tears about the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I moved on him completely, and set me beside the pompons.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for war, it was sorry for all the years of the faithful companion of this struggle, and wanted to help him to write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had something different from life as a war. the FARC was not expected to preserve him and his six brothers before the hunger strike. "I never thought that someone would have been forgiven to me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society there, that is waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have learned only how I have to handle with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now there is peace, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">For the start of the students, students and some leaders of the FARC came to a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were up grown up as early as the war and the FARC already existed in Verbordered.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leader of the FARC declared the history of organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years, we witnessed how we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can contribute to the society in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">For a goal of this size, it is worth to overcome all obstacles, "said one of them.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed by:</seg>
<seg id="2226">These people had not found to hear, who had never seen hearing and had no electoral law, and to recognize that people who have seen often as Monster, and even hate them, even people with beautiful feelings, which were turned by their habitats and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality, in which the country lives, does hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforted me that all men - also those who have killed and so much damage caused us to bring us and give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote to Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the archbishop of the city of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The column was made that after deforestation peace would rule.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as it inequality, hunger and a lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to attack the weapons and justifies for their rights. and that's also quite justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We now put down from the FARC on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all the defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology belong to them - to rise over all those who dream by a country in the war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, afford our contribution and bring sacrifice, because we know from their own experience that nothing is simple. those among us who defend life as the basis of existence, many difficulties are coming.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2243">Homosexual and queer people who live in the Caucasus region are exposed to a large bandwidth of dangers - including discrimination, physical and sexual violence and stress.</seg>
<seg id="2244">With terrors, activists have experienced the reporting of the last months over the persecution of Chechnya in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat, like a Damocletian value related to the dorm LGBTQ community, is not only built overnight.</seg>
<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a transsexual woman from Grozny, who has shared some of their experiences with us and has talked with us about what happened in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">The LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has conquered the international impact after several months, after the reports were published, killing torture and killing queer men in the Republic of themed.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in Nowaja Gaseta; she threw a light on the methods of the Chechen authorities, who had suspected queer men and put them in secret prisons in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you have brought a Monster to the World"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a transwife, was born in Grosny, and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">Since her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When she was growing, her aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, why she went to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group of Chetchenen found out of their land woman, the hunt was opened at Sabrina.</seg>
<seg id="2254">From fear around her life, she moved to the United States last time.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was a volunteer helper at a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day was told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">This was a friend of Dagestan, a transgression that was in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took them without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, he thought it would be a friend, a copy of my documents, and spread them everywhere on the internet, with my telephone number and a picture of me. he sent them to his Chechen friends, with the following message: "then there are no men more in Chechnya that can eliminate this shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos made by my documents by the WhatsApp made the round.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was just doing a few shopping opportunities from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying: "here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned me, I felt some in my body, but I did not hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2264">Then I heard a set but this time on Chechen: "how long will you still honour the family?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I don't know that there was a young man, no 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost the consciousness and awoke of the final dudes in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had all taken and started to cry out.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two times in my right pulmonary.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which spice were you laid - in the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are obsolete, since there is still my male name, but the doctor stood and laid me at the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful for this.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time in his office, I got it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out as good human being.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he was respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month at the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">I got threats in the last February.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, stranger, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a Alptrauma.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The requested to resend me to Chechnya in order to prove that all that was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They set absurd demands: some told me, I must prove it, going up in the streets without the streets; others said that I had not changed my family in the official television that everything was bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I say in television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this print?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still difficult for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people said once my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">They said to her, "You have brought a monster to the world, not only your family, but the whole republic is damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2290">We can not touch you because you are a good woman, but you must disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother was too much and she lay down a strick around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbours and they saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and already a few hours later, under the window a car with dark window plates and a number plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time it was clear that there was a little lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends overtested the numbering - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activist.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For safety reasons I will not give their names, but I want to say that I remember them all. they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help, I left the country, but then something happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can't understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother soon as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without register without me without notice.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered at a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment, when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't believe in security, only because you have left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know, in which Hotel du steckst. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it: it's the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was indeed my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">But we don't talk about gender equality, but this is a table theme.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still bear some traditional Caucasian elements.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So much I wish it to do that this seelic barrier can't be overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that, as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to violate them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">If we chill with camera, I give me good effort to look like the person, to which they remember from their past - so on my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But this is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who have taken place?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For whom I needed more information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke with somebody who saved one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan had not been arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan were hardly able to wait, and he didn't lock a new shaft.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">So that I, they probably invite the relatives to take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end demand a proof that the so-called "glory" through blood of genius.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are you too pregnant women in this mystery?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of me says, there wouldn't be many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, in particular, those who have no rich relations, or who were left out of their relatives, Kadyrows are to put in judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they will be held there, so that they can present them later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: should they be killed, you will show her body in television, and claim that they attacked some village or military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, but targeted to radialize themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this now only a mutation or have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I have just imprisoned someone who had been imprisoned in Argun for a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison, after being grown up.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new of them.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply have taken them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was taken away as those people were taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2342">But until now they were not introduced as a Bandits, there was no reports so far. we guess that such promotions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would it not be allowed to shave these people?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnapping of people who belong to a so-called "nontraditional" orientation, already in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always bore my hair for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think before 2003 I was already known in Grozny, when I lived there - and I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sharia was applied, I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much more secure than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">Russia would initially wanted to bring us to the "Civilization" but ultimately rejected us into the stone period.</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were exhausted; I had coloured lashes, bore tube and short Tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The safety ministry of the Sharia has never bent me a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people hit as me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches stood, and the whole city knew thereof; they knew why men, young people met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a speech: Kharda ma Kharda. this means: "mock not over the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">You often say it often to children, if they are funny about sick people.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so did they simply shut up their eyes in front of you because they believed, you are sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never regretailed me, never chased and never defeated.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this sort of mercy?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow came upon the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began to speak in TV about Moral.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not say about us by se, but above the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Yet - we could feel like to change the people in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Who had pened before and suffered, looked at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I couldn't feel like the situation in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity is you going to go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much enough in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I'm still acting as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">At present, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communions with them as a kind of Psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We perfectly organize tea, gathering, I buried them to the hospital and help them to get essence cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I'm not a cent for this.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people even when I climbed to a refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslima and I would like to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: apply a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is althy.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Such is nature, that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens who prophesy to you with foam before the mouth, there is no pigs.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Those who have the Cabardiner who have the oardiner, which are the Russians also exist: but on the whole planet it is - but not in Chechnya. "</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it is very pleasant to hear what to hear.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go into the mosque, and during Ramadan keys - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Do you know, many think about transidity of men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a Trusteer.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different kinds of feelings to be exact, different life settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me, it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry that I will be so personally, but my last intime relationship is now already longer than one year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad - I know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warns before an increase of self-moral within the impoverished Arabian Ahwazi-Community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region is suffering from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last months there is a strong increase in self-moral.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The picture of the Arab worker in Iran was made by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man called Jassim Moramazi on August 27, the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi-community in Iran, which is influenced by poverty and unemployment.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered among attacks, depression, and he was able to keep his own help for his own help, so Ahwazi human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video held on YouTube, the moments after he had lighted off itself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people put it fast to delete the flames again, and Moramazi was brought into the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, burns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide committed in August in the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activist before the spot, that even more men could take the life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some other - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - captured this month.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have a thing together: there were all family members, who are due to persecutions on the Iranian government, helpless and unbeatable, to feed their families to nourish and secure work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, which is located in the most part of Iran's Arab Ahwazi community, was shaken by a profound economic crisis, causing the native Arab population to contest their habitat.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy took power over and took great efforts to finish ethnic autonomy in all Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region there are some of the largest in Iran existing oil and gas fields as well as some of the most successful and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, regional economy develops only slowly, and the native population gets only little of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and relaxation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime is rejected by the Ahwazi Arabs systemic jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also has a variety of demption, the waters of the Arab areas in the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These demons have only led to destroy the devastation of destruction in the region, and local agriculture as well as the fish and palm trees industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi-adolescents grew up to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian Director General for Cooperative, Labour and Social Welfare, announced that 5% of the Ahwazis, who completed a work in primary school, completed 55% of a secondary school and received 45% a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... it aims to destroy the Spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian ancestor human rights activists in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination, leads to a" high rise "in the number of self-moring under the young Ahwazi-men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Dohimi said that especially the unemployment has become even worse. the reason is a combination of a high number of in Ahwaz's coming ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the setting process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since functionaries and institutions is preferable to adjust Arab labor forces, the local Arabian Ahwazi will have access to work in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the Spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to conquer their lifetime outside their home Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to hide their advantages and surnames to hide their affiliation to the Ahwazi, as Arab names are not tolerated at the workplace, because the Speech of the Arab language or the carrying Arabic clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the given circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi have to bear human rights activists, before the location explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to wait if the world had wakes up, and it takes about it.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I don't want to identifying feminism with the feminism, even with the intersectionality"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photos. recorded by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons license.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is an revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the Afroféminas website. the article was subject of several discussions where many different positions came into expression.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">If I say that I am no feminist, many women - especially white women who draw himself as intersectional feminists - with Frust.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even have well thought scientific and social arguments from me why I should be feminist and why we should generally be all the feminist *.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, in spite of the same education, women still earn less money than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under stringent observation if it comes to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women soaked in various fields of life to a glass ceiling, and that discrimination based on sex are still across through the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware of me and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced of it and I suffer twice and triple.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: if I come on skin colour, on black cis women to suffer black transidente women, on black women in the LGBTIQ church or on black women, if I have already been physically used, seelian and verbal need, both in as well as outside of feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Nevertheless, however, are all accepted that women - all women have to come together to sing "their voices and 'Kumbaya, my lord' to sing" to meet the equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about it, in addition to sexualised violence, a institutions of quantized form is motivated, which we are exposed to black women on two times.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or about that black women and women of other ethnicities and women often earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background more often beyond the school are expelled as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women are exposed to a higher risk in black donor and women with a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence against the partnership, as white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the other hand, I want all men, all men, and all men each other than the same rights. on the other hand, I can't join me as a black woman in whose center the white woman is refused to consider unrighteous in their thinking, which relate to gender as well as the skin colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I'm exhausted and will no longer be struggling to fight my affiliation in a white feminist builders who has always regained me and countless black women always and always rejected.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Defendants in 1851, in her speech: "I am not a woman?" and I also refuse me to justify an ideology in which the black woman in a historic way is a deserted and marginalized beings.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I softened to join me in the group, which can absorb our customs and customs, to describe your egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will not try to take white women the importance of overlaps of skin colour and gender. as some of them continue to keep the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to revive them.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded in order to give women from different heralism and renders from white Feminism, is still the word "Feminism" in his name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I'm going to release me full and completely from Feminism, who has been called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of me for a white feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever before we will define black women to our own performances and give us into the hospital that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: Reclaiming Ourselves (about: Africa-Womanism) says that we can defend ourselves to our own way, in which they can be perfectly safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, seelian, physical and even the spiritual elements can be avoided by the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists immediately retrieve separatism and exclusion, after they have read these lines, please refer to the hypocrisy and contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanist environment I can raise black women and women of other cultures because I existed in this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be accepted because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a portion of this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman can flourish in a environment, in which my life cannot overtaken, nor will be ignored.</seg>

<seg id="2470">In this documentation of Emily Kinskey, we follow Musa, who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of contamination onto his community.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and modified version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" by Kurds. the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# weilichunefraubin), which reports about the Gewähr to women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names were changed for the protection of the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">One police commissioner said Ada Báez, that she was nothing against Luis Balbuena, its expartner who had become violent.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of her relationship has been around time and the police said, her statement would be put to the acts, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When a further wife Balbuena was pointed out because of abuse, the acute display of Ada Báez has nothing to do.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second wife passed her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">The Teufelskate of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women listened at all once, they generally receive any support from the State.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women also have financially dependent on men who are misused. this explains why only 20% of all women who admit, victims of violence at all, are to report on the prosecutor authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Contents and statistics of inclusions 1 Invisible mistreation and a legal system that nothing undernimmed 3 Paraguay laws: good approach, lack of implementation and stats</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is hard to determine how many women really harassed, says Myrian González, researcher at the Centro de Humentación y Estudios, a social scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are various information and reports that show the extent of the gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay," explains them.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the figures available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the Attorney General Attorney at the State Attorney at 9600 were arrested because of domestic violence. 70% of them went about violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of ads in the police arrived by women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads due to domestic violence in peace. 86% of the ads came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In ads, 40% of women reported that they were physically challenged, 55% of women spoke of mental abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics show not the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguayischen Frauenminister Ana Baiardi, only few of this offenders are actually indicated. "on every woman who are not able to do in Paraguay for mental abuse, 9 women, who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">On every woman who are reimbursed for physical abuse, two women, who do not do this, declared it at the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2499">There's no own criminal case in Paraguay, the prosecutions authorities can not document inadequate, how many women are murdered every year from their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016, journalists were killed at least 12 cases of women in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The co-ordinator for human rights in Paraguay have been documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, in Paraguay all ten days a woman died of violence through men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible Missions and an legal system that cannot undertaketh nothing</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez was the fixed girlfriend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the name of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">At the beginning, she didn't want to do this again, but after that, she should always regretted them.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today, Mariana is 28 years old and not more with Carlos together. however, they carried out the psychic violence against women - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe recognizable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I have never thought that I would have a victim of mistreaction.</seg>
<seg id="2509">If I have read about it earlier, I always thought that only women have happened to teach, because they can cause themselves of violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen that.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the mistreatment by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, they wrote posts on Facebook, in which they described his interests and several attacks during their two-year relationship, and told how he had isolated them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people answered their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetoric, whether he have lifted up his hand against them and refused to be revealed that his behaviour was also a form of mistreaction.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana, why she had fallen so long by Carlos and did not leave it earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least would have a certain schooling.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who was not from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay, to prove that their former partner made them harassed.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo-CREO network ("I believe you") which consists of women who are all victims of mistreacts in any way.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group you can speak with others on their experiences, listen to each other and help each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do this, what many others do not do: take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias Case everything began with mental abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Their wealthy partner managed to convince her that she was valuable.</seg>

<seg id="2525">Paraguay laws: good approach, lack of implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"there are many laws in Paraguay, which are very good, but not applied.</seg>
<seg id="2527">The ad is a way full of resistors and a fight against corruption in the judiciary, "says Victoria Santos.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN Organization for women in Paraguay, also provides great problems in the application of the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed under the paraguayan parliament, who became known under the hashtag # Porellas (# Füry).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# non-Less) are part of a campaign on Twitter which is supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original design of the law sees to explain Femitid to a separate criminal offence and harder it is the case already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus, the legislature was altered in some points, in order to win the deputies for the law, that the way for the decriminalization of Abbot-net, which currently banned in Paraguay, and to be punished with up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill had intended to cost the most of the (bureaucratic and economic) of the process which have to bear the victims of violence even though they just wish to obtain a secure accommodation and secure accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argued that the law is not effective when the legislature does not provide sufficient financial resources for this:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay it is seen as part in human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">This must take place here, that violence is not considered to be more than somewhat norms.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Whoever is silent in view of these facts makes it guilty and contributes to that the perpetrators will come out.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We have to put it as long as long display until abuse of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was adopted in the paraguayischen Senate. previously, parts of the law has been changed, including a passage that partners had proclaimed in cases of domestic violence against reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions about the changes will go apart.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture is carried out by understanding</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is only rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that is addressed one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the demand in the place of medical research, there are two reasons for a lack of global health professionals, many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical demand on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have in the poorest countries of Africa far more serious effects than elsewhere, and lack of investments in the research of these diseases by the pharmaceuticals are a great problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research, which is carried out by African scientists themselves, in order to establish its own research capacity in Africa. a major role of science and technology can only be eligible for economic growth in the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit warer is director of the Centre for exploring infectious diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic showed first engraved effects on the national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As Postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he researched themselves on HIV-virus, before he decided to go back home to assist the samic health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warriors discussed about the future of medical research in Zambia and over abuse of media over these research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warriors speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the emphasis lies on the application of research results. I support the samic National Programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I use a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">Gv: what are your opinion about the important current scientific topics in your country and in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise we will always stay receiver, rather than Macher rather than ever.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions that we get are often not good in our environment, and sometimes it is impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">Gv: where does financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find appropriate scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are being supported differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who come back or come here, because funding and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Gv: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research that you didn't had before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money, continuous supplies with electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">Gv: how is the public opinion about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would propose that critical thinking and scientific methods to be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Gv: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they concentrate, and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There are needs of special scientific training, beginning in any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, Big Data, investigational health care (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Gv: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientist in Africa over western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often, there are a limited speed, things to do, and the resulting access to scientific expertise that represent challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines are only accessible to payment (the so-called "Paywall"), also limited amount of available information and speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how to change global food production such as "Open Source" seed producers</seg>
<seg id="2628">This contribution by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com website, a magazine published on solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outreddish, the first plant, cultivated by NASA astronauts in space and has been honours.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For nearly 20 years, Morton work was only allowed through its own incriminating and the question as many salads can get limits.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more salads were patented and that he could not use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only suitable for individual varieties, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a special rotor or green or contaminated leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the last years, more such patents have been applied to more plants such as cereal or cartels types. due to this trends, plant breeders, environmental protection and experts ensure food safety around the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of thousands of old tradition, morton still uses lettuce, but meanwhile it takes longer, since its work is increasingly worthy of getting more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is, as it was in a river a boulders, to whom I should shrunk." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">So, let's do that now, but it is a break with breeding tradition, "says he." I think that these patents are going to go far too far.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before court, no one can withstand a new salad of salads, because all features are already patented. "he makes it so good as possible and try to recover those features, which he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and labors, not to use material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined one movement that is always greater in the USA and anywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source" -breedings).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have been bred and eaten at the Sorted Outreddish of the "greenhouses" of the station bred and eaten. there's been tested whether plants can be cultivated in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds like that it would come from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for Open Source "seed) can be inspired by motion for free" Open Source "software that provides alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was called into life to ensure that some plant species and gene are not protected as intellectual property and can be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, shortly Ossi, U.S. breeders could also undertake that others can use them free from them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed, and they can sell it. "open source" breeders allow you to cross your seed, and it is not immediately going out - two aspects which are prohibited or prescribed by many plants.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Economic prospects outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">Professor of the University of Wisconsin - Madison and Ossi Board member Jack Kloppenburg are control over the seed and the possibility to discipline new plants, both important for food safety and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds require a role in major merge such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter with natural resistance to produce seed.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "open-source" movement is not busy with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "who would like to buy our aim and increasingly important examples in the global agricultural industry, as it is offered in August or September 2016, should also know that the way that vegetables are cultivated as well as this vegetables is bred.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Nutrition sovereign without seed sovereign is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative is undertake to provide others their seed-well-free to provide seed in contrast, seed and plant features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi Supporters arguably that the future of food supply is endangered, since the available gene pool because of the more abundant mental property rights on plant material, which is thus always restricted, unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive Director of Ossi, has been involved in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrot and their availability. it found out that about one-third of all cartels are protected as intellectual property, making it either even usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, such estimates are still not yet, but experts like Luby, that massacred plants are patented as wheat in even larger style as a salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Visions</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants become so farmed that they may have targeted characteristics - of such that their taste or her color improves up to such, due to them thrive in certain environments and threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing because of increasingly more patents. genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever before, since the changed terms through climate change are much worse.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto-speaking spokeswoman Carly Scaduto, that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanitation activities. with a total of four gene banks and the cooperation with institutions such as the agricultural ministry of the United States set the company for the preservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">However, however, the view is that intellectual property will promote other breeders, since "patents and protection of plants varied Innovations". "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow, as soon as the patent expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection does not inhibits innovations, but promotes it by the public more material and know-how to be provided. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks different: 20 years to wait until a patent pending, but certainly no innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to plants to plants that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one would have already lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is that genetic resources always have been a general practitioner always should remain: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetting incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers to their work.</seg>
<seg id="2671">That's why it is adviser and it is impossible to be impossible, if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">In total, Morton is disturb on the concept of patented, plant features: "we are creating the characteristics really itself.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders, we have no idea how the plants do it.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For the Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US state of Oregon and Ossi, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "who breeders a variety, breeding his own values in them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believes to the industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures are to be required to cultivate the cultivation of herbicides, which breathe in his varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exactly contrary. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized enterprises (such that move to international markets, but smaller than for example Monsanto are) patents have to survive the most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either reject it or keep it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">Frank Morton is based on its breeding garden Salads in its breeding garden Salads.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo of Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that breeders through the Avoid of plant patina would be innovative: "it looks as I think with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies that patenting.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I need some new material for my catalogue because I know that my competitors will sell my sorts in a few years, "says he." with a patent man is protected 20 years ahead of competition, which makes it easy for my opinion. "worldwide resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">Indeed, the United States appear to be a leader in the Open Source, but the concept has meanwhile spread across the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture") describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, creating a "open source plant for plant plants. the center with farmers works together and helps them to breathe new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It is also supported to come to "Open Source" seed and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German Organization Agrecol works at an Open Source "license which ultimately has a formal and legally binding form of Ossi obligation for breeding in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for breeding different from country to country where Ossi obligation cannot simply be taken one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patented. thus, she speaks for the current practice of the European Patent Office, the patents are allowed in conventionally cultivated plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, a statement is not yet a law; now it is to governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organised a conference on "Open Source" seed companies in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of seed companies and representatives of governments, non-governmental organizations and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the "open source" seed movement and the worldwide trend for patentation of seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for "Open Source" seed scheme, explains that the organization is currently able to raise global alliance for "Open Source" seed systems for the planned next year of the official start.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A merger of environmental protection and development aid (among them Hivos, the international nonprofit development organization USC Canada and the action group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database to seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Essens - a Verbund from aid organisations such as WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - a report published in which farmers have to bring to seed and improve seed policies, thus making a stable supply of food products.</seg>
<seg id="2694">In the report also the importance of a varied, local supply with seed for sustainable food systems emphasises - a connection, by Luby von Ossi, hopes it will be able to recognize him soon.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"" "" "" "the movement for regional and ecological food has especially been cultivated where and how something is cultivated, and seed systems have hardly played a role," "" "Luby." "" "we are trying to make people clear that more behind her food is" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the newest goals of the censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">Still unlock the Egyptian authorities contents on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a column.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of August 5th the Egyptian government closed the website of the Office Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published a statement on Facebook, in which it criticised the Egyptian authorities for this step sharp and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Office Network for Human Rights Announces lead-- despite this attack and the Constitution of the Egyptian law and the Constitution should continue to pursue these objectives, so it was never so important as now. ANHRI confirmed that all technical possibilities should be exhausted to overcome and not admit. we hope to meet our task to continue our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first scension website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities blocked more than two months 21 websites, such as the independent news page MADA Masr, Arabic-language edition of the Huffington Post and Qatar-based network of Al Jazeera because of alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1st Human Rights Organization of the wave of web presses like victims. @ anhri is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI there is no access to the blog of the column and human rights scientist Ahmed Gamal Ziada no more access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took his blog for spreading column and articles that he did not contact in Egypt for in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now, the blog, which he addressed to circumvent the Zensurad of the Egyptian government, even the goal of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider of the supplier of Ziadas blog is home, however, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after being arrested by Egyptian security forces during December 2013, while he reported about the student protests, and recorded a video like the police of physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His article are mainly around politics and human rights conditions in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook commentary Ziada said to the plung by the government and reflected what this means to him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">Those, blogs to lock is very old, however, in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi priority; and even if the plung of the blogs may not be meaningful for the world, it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It is managed to give me the feeling of a siege of siege; An arrest, a supreme assassination attempt on the national Security Council, recharge blogs blogs, as well as any other website for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) They have proven that I had not written in vain. in other words, my words have influence, even if only a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I wish to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used to catch the post of articles in order to handle the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">However, after they have blocked him, and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The muffles go to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities closed on 24 May to 06 August 133 pages. these were technical testing in the networks of various Internet service providers (ISP), including orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the blocking of providers that was possible through the reversing of Internet ensur and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday the 12th of June we did as the rejection of websites that VPNs began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">A such practice indicates the intention of the government to block content and filters to access the Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is additionally scrapped, that the censurment must be made behind closed doors, which the Egyptian population does not have a legal basis, using which they can proceed against this actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack them as next?</seg>

<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative, so we don't close our eyes as an journalists in front of the grave.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, the editor said that this decision was no reason for pride, but rather a sign of failure.</seg>

<seg id="2771">In an article on the News Portal The Intercept Brasil argumed the journalist in Cecília Oliveira, who would draw violence as "war." this is a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to draw responsibility for the police.</seg>

<seg id="2874">Two years ago, a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mujahedin group, which had overcome the short-lasting one-Soviet government. in Afghanistan, Afghanistan became a country of terrors and despair.</seg>

<seg id="2885">The Taliban always got closer to the Hazara well-known Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country toward Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">Some days after his escape, Ahaaf found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">A few years he worked in a Kohlegrube. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took this, what was left of his low wages, and went into Iran. once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and towing sacks with mortars, heavier than he himself, to earn his lifetime.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time, the lives of Afghan refugees in Iran was influenced by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," remembered Ahaaf in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived at a building site at the building site, which we worked on.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no services there and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open window, so that we do not freeze the night at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without Papers in Iran and made ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time was Asharaf homeless, ran only through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day in food to help.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy due to relatively high awareness levels is a kind of second chance for past asylum seekers. however, it's true that the conditions for asylum seekers in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The Human Rights Organisation of Civil liberties Union for Europe writes, the system is suffers to transparency about a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">The vast majority of asylum seekers is housed in the more than 3000 "special reception centres." this is an improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared staff. "</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be assigned to a recording center when it officially opened an application for asylum - what can be applied for months after the registration of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then people who have no money for an accommodation, either mentioned on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the road.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So there was Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his undefiled soul helped Asharaf to free out of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After he had made various works in the construction industry for several years, Asharaf put his entire sparse into the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italian - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Lots of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to inofficial estimates, approximately 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Over the past few years, some of Afghanistan operating companies were created, among them skilleries, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even blessed in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea to his restaurant Oriental Experience, in which the waiter and the kitchen personnel are mainly refugees from various parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of restaurants tells us through the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek courts, the history of their journey to Italy.</seg>
