that is James R@@ isen .
they might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize for the New York Times repor@@ ter .
long before someone heard from Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book , in which he published its spectacular that N@@ SA had illegal teleph@@ ones from Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a permanent impression .
in this , he describes a cat@@ astroph@@ ic US intelligence service in which the CIA was literally super@@ imposed for a nuclear bomb .
if the crazy sounds , you read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know , who did not know the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
for nearly 10 years , the government has determined against R@@ isen and asked him to call his alleged sources .
in this train , he was to condemn the symbol of the government to condemn W@@ hist@@ leb@@ ars and journalists .
according to the first review , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to use this right when media cannot get this information and if they cannot protect identity of the mu@@ ff@@ les that they give .
so when the government was at R@@ isen , he did something that many bra@@ ve repor@@ ters were already before him : he refused , saying that he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk to go into prison .
but then , just days before the process , something unusual .
suddenly , although they are too long for years that it would be indisp@@ ens@@ able for their case , the government &apos;s demands were dropped to R@@ isen .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , the repor@@ ter and sources may always be h@@ edges .
instead of f@@ ails and aw@@ nings to make statements , this could also do his digital foot@@ steps for him .
and so , the investigations , without his understanding , wor@@ ried about his telephone calls ,
as well as its e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , his credit card , and even travel activities with the list of its flights .
in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA @-@ W@@ hist@@ lively and risk .
unfortunately this is one of many cases .
President Obama promised him to protect W@@ hist@@ ories . but instead , the justice convicted more than all U.S. governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how that can be a problem , especially because the government is too much of their work as a home .
since September 11 , almost every article about national safety was the result of that a W@@ hist@@ leb@@ ars went to a journalist .
so , we set the press work on the game that should be protected by the first constitutional complaint because the government has more possibilities to choose all .
but just as the technology of the government permits to handle the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better .
and although they can contact the moment , in which they receive contact , rather than in the after@@ ward .
today , there are communication software that had not yet been written down as the isen book , and it is much more saf@@ er than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls .
an technology is Secure@@ drop , an open source transfer system for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet &apos;s famous Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is now being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I have been working .
instead of send an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , such as the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information as with any ordinary contact form .
this will be encrypted and stored on a server , which only has access the relevant message agency .
so the government can do no more information secretly , and many of the information that they would like would not be available from advance .
Secure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom of the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments of all over the world will always develop new sp@@ y @-@ technologies that all end@@ anger@@ ed .
it is in us to ensure that not only technology controls such as Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to apply mis@@ sil@@ ently . it is just important that we protect the next W@@ hist@@ s ,
the over abuse during the supply of soldiers compl@@ ying and reported by over@@ crow@@ ded hospitals . or the next environmental worker , the alarm to conce@@ al water from Fl@@ int . or a Wall@@ street @-@ Insider , who war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies have not only been made for those who want to expos@@ e crimes , but to protect the rights of all constitu@@ ents .
thank you .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 , the largest data collection of the history is published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; reveal that the rich and M@@ igh@@ ty &#93; have been hidden by Global Wit@@ ness to have a declaration . &#93; this week we asked by News about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ se@@ ca
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of the tax @-@ rab@@ bits .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers to companies such as Mos@@ sack Fon@@ se@@ ca and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you do it ? &quot;
in fact , we really see emails , the exchange of messages like the entire system works as it works .
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister is back .
there is also reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad letter companies in tax ev@@ ens has .
it is claimed that a track of $ 2 billion to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous C@@ elli@@ sts .
now there will be a lot of rich people and others to wait nerv@@ ous to the next release , and to the next un@@ veil documents .
now it sounds like the plot of an agency or a John @-@ Gr@@ ish@@ am @-@ ROM .
it seems wine from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is : if the rich and mighty are able to hide their assets in tax ev@@ ens and not all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that applies to us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these presses are phenom@@ enal .
in all over the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ev@@ ens of some few are used to hide their wealth and swal@@ lowed up -- something that we have been discuss@@ ing for ten years and un@@ veil .
I think many people appear very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is difficult to understand such as these control phases will work .
I always take it like an Mat@@ ry@@ osh@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so one company has a company in another company , in another company which makes it almost impossible to understand , who is behind this building .
it can be very difficult for criminal prosecution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what it is .
I think it is interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the USA .
presumably because there were no prominent Americans so far in these abst@@ entions , that Sk@@ and@@ al arrived .
now it is not so that there is no rich Americans that their wealth in tax @-@ rab@@ bits are h@@ edges .
but by principle , after which these control phases work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers .
if we had a data base of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , it is so that you need to specify less information in some US states to form a company than to get a company library .
this type of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed to finish school children from school children .
it offers fr@@ aud@@ sters to finish especially an@@ tic@@ ulated feeder .
it is this kind of behaviour that affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this is in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent an investig@@ ator in the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator gave himself as a African Minister , who wanted to bring susp@@ ects money into the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really sho@@ cked that all till an advoc@@ ate of our investig@@ ator proposals , how he could transfer@@ ed his money .
these were all pre@@ vent@@ ures . none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course no one was given to us money . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as individual cases .
it is not about any individual lawyer , who sp@@ read@@ out investigations into our covered investig@@ ator .
it does not work for a single top pol@@ iti@@ ker , wrapped in a sc@@ and@@ al .
it is because the system works , by corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to handle this , we need to change the rules of the rules .
we must change the rules to make this kind of behaviour .
this may really sound really sound , as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing ever had changed ; as if it will always have the rich and mighty .
but as a native optim@@ istic , I really see that some change has begun .
in the past few years we have seen a lot more transparency to see what the owners are concerned .
the topic found political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU measures in central regi@@ sters at national level , who really is behind companies in Europe , and who controls them .
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the US died here .
representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both Parliament chambers , but this does not make progress that we would like to see .
we would really like to see how this Panama dis@@ ables , this huge insight into the world of tax ev@@ ens , used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and global .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for changes .
we need ordinary people who are w@@ asted if they see how other people can hide their true identity behind lights .
we need managers in the economy , which stand and say , &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and continue to end through the laws of this kind of transparent .
together we can now termin@@ ate the in@@ transparency , which now does this type of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing .
this is the story , as I was ab@@ duc@@ ted almost immediately and in the trunk area of a red Maz@@ das had to be landed .
one day after I completed my designer studies , I made a rear sale .
a type in red Maz@@ da stayed and looked upon my stuff .
he bought one of my art works .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country . thereafter he would go to peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep today ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he made the whole thing even worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just didn &apos;t know him ! he says he would not go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he is really planning . I don &apos;t have kidn@@ apped in the boot of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small trunk !
then I heard myself : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You like ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the night I was in bed , I star@@ red to the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what happened to me there ?
a wild@@ man sleeps in my living room .
what if it is crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of bed , on to@@ ast tips to the door , and my sleep door closed .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in touch .
the art works that he had purchased from me today is in his class@@ room . he is now a teacher .
that was my first experience as host . it has changed my viewing angle .
perhaps the people who were sold me in childhood than strangers were sold , actually friends that are only waiting for it to be discovered ?
people living on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
we make a time jump , two years later ...
I &apos;m unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my roomm@@ ates , and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I believe , creativity can make it to transform in fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new roomm@@ ates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I did surprise how we might make something to make . our apartment is equipped to a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , WLAN and a desk including , with a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a site and founded so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on a wooden floor .
they found it great , and we also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sure that our cheese @-@ ham @-@ O@@ mel@@ ee tast@@ ed completely different because we made them for our guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we t@@ oured to them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and the door in the castle , Brian and I joined us .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our hire ?
things came into rolls .
my former roomm@@ ates , n@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ c@@ zy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to figure out whether they could make it a business concept .
so we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a site , on the people publicly tra@@ ded pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms , whose doors closes when you come pass .
over the Internet , they can then invite a foreign people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the miss@@ ile would ign@@ ite .
but did he do not .
no one who is still at comfort would have been investing in a business , which is allowed to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we have learned all children , strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you &apos;ll get in the things that can be good . we are able to design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts we had learned that design is much more than just appearance and h@@ ap@@ tics -- it is the total experience .
we had learned how to designs objects , but now we wanted to create through design imm@@ oral confidence between people who never had before .
can design aff@@ ord anything ?
is it possible to create with design confidence ?
I wish to give you a sample sample , what degree trust we control .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will be sc@@ aled out of your comfort .
thum@@ bs up , if you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ lock mobile phone your left seat .
this silent flight from pan@@ ic you will feel - -- is exactly what hosts feel the door if they open the door .
for the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , you can see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked cell phone of a stranger in the hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
so feel most guests , if they stay in differently .
only for this reason , our company may exist .
just so , who actually has Al Go@@ res &apos;s mobile ?
could you declare on Twitter that he di@@ min@@ ated for the Office of the Pre@@ sidents ?
you can now return the cell phones now .
they now have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build . I want to tell you of some discover@@ ies .
what if we have changed a little detail in that experiment ?
what if your neigh@@ bor had taken place once again with his name , if he had told , where he comes , how his dog or his children be called ?
imagine you have 150 ass@@ ess@@ ments who say all : &quot; he really can hold very well un@@ locked cell@@ phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when using your mobile phone ?
because a well thought feedback system strengthens trust .
at the beginning , we have done some things wrong .
it was difficult to cover the people to neg@@ atively .
ultimately , we decided to wait until both hosts as well as guest had given their findings before we set them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we have performed with Stan@@ ford a study . we examined how probably it is that people trust one another , depending on how they are similar to the ages and housing .
a little sur@@ pris@@ ingly we trust the people most , which are most popular .
the more differences we find , the less confidence we trust .
this is a natural social Vo@@ re@@ proof .
it is exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by ass@@ ess@@ ments .
if one has less than three divisions change , nothing changes .
but it has more than ten , changes everything .
a good reputation for simil@@ ar@@ ities from .
so the right design can help us to overcome some of our deep roots .
in addition , we drove that confidence is dependent on how much one is priced .
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
if one tells too little , such as &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer .
one tells you how to say : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted .
so there is an optimal degree of op@@ enn@@ ess , e.g. &quot; T@@ olle art works in your apartment ! I do with my family vacation . &quot;
how to create it with design , how to make this degree of op@@ enn@@ ess ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right quantity text . we also give tips to which topics should write something .
our whole company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our advantages over the fore@@ igner .
with which we had not counted , was the great amount of people who were more than ready to push this pre@@ face .
here you can see how many people take our offer .
one can recognize three things .
first : unbelievable good luck .
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a need that was not covered previously .
the shop is very good for us .
of course there are times when not everything is smooth .
there were guests who celebrated un@@ permitted parties or dwellings .
hosts will leave guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I have worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood in front of front when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than those calls . there is already hurt if I think it only .
the dis@@ appointment , which was heard in the voice of the call , was also always our largest motivation to improve .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , only a fra@@ ction of the 123 million overn@@ ights only had a problem .
for people trusted one to another .
when trust works , miracle will arise .
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack there .
his hosts drove him to hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for trav@@ ellers who tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and with sufficient hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ and@@ ra are genuine protective gel that save a life although they don &apos;t know it right .
they ride a car in the hospital if you dies , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want that one feels good , they bring books .
you can even stay longer , without charge the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course not any stay is running .
but these relations behind the pure money reaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
I asked for the first time about this term , I asked me :
how does the idea of a sub@@ merged with money inter@@ actions ?
it is a economic trade here .
but it &apos;s just just &quot; rental industry &quot; to name , the thing is not justified .
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people lay a part of itself , and that changes everything .
if one travels from today , it is efficient and reliable , but it is efficient and reliable , but this is less authentic .
however , if trips a rich buffet from local in@@ press would be ?
what would be , if in every place you visited , a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and one at a bar tour , from which you have never heard it ;
or if you could cook cooking of a five @-@ star chef ?
today , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what would , if we would like to share apartments of the ground to shared use ?
what would that look like ?
what would , if cities would have taken the idea of a common share ?
I &apos;ll introduce cities to help us society and relationships , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and rest@@ or@@ ying .
in South Korean capital , Seoul , this project started already . lots of parking spaces that belonged to the government ,
the residents were offered now . students who were looking for a lead in search of a lead .
were medi@@ ated to people whose children were gone out . incub@@ ators have been started ,
in order to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be host to a stranger or self @-@ host .
so the idea seems to be so crazy about how it was brought to us .
we are not re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality also gave it before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why has just our works ?
apart from happiness and Tim@@ ing , we realized that we can find the right design with the components of confidence .
design can help us to overcome deep roots .
I find it bl@@ oss@@ ess ,
just to overwhelming .
I have to think about it if a red Maz@@ da is over to me .
of course , we know that design can &apos;t solve each problem .
but if it was able to help us if it had this great influence , I ask myself what we can use for design .
thank you .
what do you think if you watch me ?
a faithful ? a expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , under@@ wear a terror under@@ wear ?
or simply a delay in security check at the airport .
that is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the gu@@ ilt for your negative impressions .
so , the media is the same as I look like .
a study revealed that 80 % of coverage of Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : the Americans think most would not know Muslims .
presumably the people do not speak with their U@@ ber @-@ drivers .
for all those who have never learned one Muslims : it is great to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee maker -- Double Esp@@ res@@ so , with whi@@ pped cream extra .
I am the stra@@ pped ,
a se@@ al@@ eg@@ ern fitness fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ine ,
and I &apos;m an practic@@ ing , spiritual Muslims .
but not as Lady G@@ aga sing , because , baby , I was not so born .
I decided to help me .
when I was 17 , I met the decision to ou@@ ched me .
no , not as a hom@@ osexual person , like some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
the L@@ ust@@ le was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist Declaration of Independence , and in contrast to the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old felt me to match a perfect and in@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only thought the faith of my parents .
I have with the cor@@ an .
I read it , thought after , exhibited in question , doub@@ ted and believed .
my relationship to God was not love at first sight .
she was trust and slow dev@@ otion to deep@@ ening themselves with each reading of the Kor@@ an .
the beauty of the rhyth@@ mic brings me sometimes to weeping .
I know myself . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel the feeling that someone claims you really under@@ stands , but somehow loves ?
so it feels like that .
later I married and started how all the good Egyptians , my career as engineering .
I had later , after my marriage , a child , and lived in the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot;
then the terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of them remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had finished at the end , looked upon the screen and saw the word &quot; Eil@@ sign . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ crafts flew into buildings , people sp@@ urs out of buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
an technical disorder ?
my shock turned to indig@@ nation quickly in indig@@ nation .
why should I do so something ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I moved to the television channel and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terror@@ ists ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh , my God .
it is not only attack@@ ing my country , but in the N@@ u turned me to susp@@ ects the works of others from a citizen in a susp@@ ects .
on the same day we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and begin with the post@@ graduate course .
I remember what I did -- when we had silent -- as deep it went into my seat , and I feared the first time as Muslims were recognized .
we moved to our apartment in this night in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
and when I heard , I saw and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic @-@ speaking organizations that had said : &quot; be careful , &quot; Be careful , &quot; un@@ lit in well lit , &quot; the assemblies are not deceived . &quot;
I stayed all the week inside .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day that Muslims were gathered to the prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the war@@ nings : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings were compreh@@ en@@ vious and I heard also of attacks on Muslims , or of men who held for Muslims , and slew them .
there were really bran@@ ched on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something felt really felt right .
because people who attacked this country have attacked our country .
I have turned the rage of the people to the terror@@ ists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it &apos;s not easy to explain the continuous self .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
there are the alleg@@ ations that are hard .
today we can say to people : &quot; there is a problem in that country -- it &apos;s Muslims .
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to ban Muslims and Mos@@ ques .
they speak of my municipality as of a tumor in the body of the USA .
it &apos;s just the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or bad ?
you know : a mal@@ icious tumor can be removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor one keeps only under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the USA , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , hel@@ pers and Olympi@@ oni@@ als .
will the closure of Mos@@ ques America safe ?
there may be a couple of parking spaces , but not to stop the terror .
the regular visit of a mosque leads to identify people other faith , and to show bigger citizen participation .
and as a leader of the police in the area of Washington , D.C. recently told : people are actually not in mos@@ ques radic@@ alised .
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or bed in front of a computer .
at the radio process you &apos;ve found that it is online . as the first , the person is cut out of their church , that the extre@@ mes group may believe that the terror@@ ists are the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behaviour and their ide@@ ology is ab@@ sent or fallen by faith .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we must stop the people to go to the mosque .
some are still speaking , Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS its brood @-@ ality with the Kor@@ an .
as Muslims , as a mother , as a man , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would have to insert into their pre@@ ference world , if you know it as a representative of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , like the K@@ u @-@ Kl@@ ux @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ide@@ ology reasons for their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
but when you cast a look at her , they do not drive out what they are in their &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot;
it is their brood @-@ ality that they can read these things into the Scriptures .
an outstanding Im@@ am told me an amazing story :
a girl arrived in him because they had pre @-@ given to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she was in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . each cl@@ ergy , with whom they had spoken , she brought her to silence , and told her , her sense of un@@ righteousness in the world , they would have only gotten in trouble .
it was inspired by nothing , and something that had had her W@@ ut sense , it was a main goal for the instrum@@ ent@@ alization through extrem@@ ists who spoke a solution .
this Im@@ am presented the connection to God and their church .
instead of acc@@ use them for their gro@@ ove , he showed her constru@@ ctive paths for a real change in the world .
what they learned in the mosque , they kept to join the IS .
that was an insight , like the Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia and my family .
but how does it work on normal American ?
how does it work on every other ?
how does the 24 hour use fear of fear every day on our democracy ?
a study -- actually , several neu@@ ros@@ ci@@ enti@@ ative studies - show : if we fear , pass at least three things .
we accept rather an author@@ itarian government system , conformity and advantages .
one study shows : if you have reported test individuals , in which negative about Muslims was reported , they rather than military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look at the mood against Muslims after the above -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the lead of Iraq war and during two elec@@ toral periods .
so , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction on Muslim terrorism , as I expected it .
it is actually a tool for man@@ ipulation to the public to express the foundation of a free society , which has reasonable and well informed citizens .
the handling of Muslims is an early warning sign .
we might feel it as the first but the toxic air of fear fell to us all .
in the assignment of collective debt , it is not just therefore to explain himself .

his sister would say to me that he was the most generous person who knew it .
she visited him there and he showed her own life . she was bl@@ oss@@ y and said :
&quot; when is such a young man from my breasts ? &quot;
just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neigh@@ bor , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , she was murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was in the afternoon . he did it in their apartment as with a execution after he had posted to Muslims on his Facebook page .
he sh@@ oss eight times to De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ ism can not only be un@@ mor@@ ally , but also dead@@ ly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we walked to the mosque , or we stayed at home ?
we discussed it and for us there was no light decision , because it was going to over@@ look forward that America we would like to check our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can exercise our religion .
we decided to get to the Mos@@ que .
with our son in the kinder@@ garten , we drove silent , with high pressure to the mosque .
I took him out , when my shoes went out , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw , let me hold .
the hall was rest@@ less filled .
then the Im@@ am appe@@ aled , and our guests welcomed us , because the half of the gathered were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , ath@@ eist@@ s , believers and non @-@ believers who were come , not to attack us but to help us .
at that moment I am collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion .
what will you choose ?
what will you be interested in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ ism ?
are you going to go on a number ?
or will you connect to those that are : we are better than that .
thank you very much .
thank you nice !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have a Ner@@ v .
but I wonder what they say that you may say that you are a T@@ ED@@ Talk , a monument with a deep @-@ run monument , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ered : I would say , you don &apos;t know . I &apos;m totally normal .
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I &apos;m as usual as it is allowed .
if one can look at the Muslims on all over the world , and I did that with the largest ever carried out study on Muslims in the whole world , people want normal things .
they want to do well for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I &apos;m not an exception in no respect .
if people like an exception to rule , then the rule is usually broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ered .
what began to be a platform for Bast@@ ers , just a few before .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . possible in research institutions worldwide .
before air @-@ packet in our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft engines at the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built up a six metre high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago they started to fly with rop@@ es .
by connecting flight devices , high speed and acceleration on a narrow space .
you can also build independently adjustable structures .
you have learned to wear loads with tur@@ bul@@ ences and to react differently to natural laws .
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of the possibility in the autonomous flight .
this means that a system aut@@ on@@ om works , it needs to know collec@@ tively , where the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic work .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new location technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratories .
there is no external cameras .
each air machine has internal sensors to determine position in the room , calculations on board , what the machine should do .
external commands are available in the highest image such as &quot; start &quot; and &quot; lan@@ den . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called h@@ edge starter ,
a flight machine , which tries to beat two flying with a fl@@ ap .
like other starters , it is efficient in advance , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations .
in contrast to most of the starters , it can be h@@ ew@@ ed , and it has great benefits at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however there is always a mit@@ er page .
a limitation of hed@@ ging is that they react sensiti@@ vely to tur@@ bul@@ ences such as wind turbines .
we develop new controllers and algorith@@ ms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight device is no matter what is the optimal position , and the performance can be improved due to practice .
okay . okay .
during our research , we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions , to the core of the matter .
one such question would be for example : what is the smallest possible number of movable parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for this to know the answer to one such question .
helicop@@ ters are known for about machines with a thousand moving parts that are gathering together to viol@@ ate you .
decades ago , drivers were flying remote controlled flight devices that only had two movable parts : a prop@@ ellers and a tail@@ gate .
so far , we discovered that flying with just one works .
this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechanically sim@@ pl@@ est remote control unit . it was invented in case recently .
it only has a movable part , a propeller ,
no valves , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse , no further actu@@ ator or control surfaces , only a propeller .
although it is mechanically simple , the inner life happens very much , so it can be stable and move in space .
nevertheless , it does not have an elegant algorithm of the tail@@ gate . to fly it to fly , I must throw it exactly right .
the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood to throw it exactly right now , is small , so I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
if the Mon@@ osp@@ inner is a practice in com@@ b@@ ulation , this machine is here , the Omni@@ head with its eight prop@@ ellers , one exercise in over@@ flow .
what to do with all this flow ?
you see that it is only symmet@@ ric .
therefore , it is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
as a result he receives the au@@ ditorium &apos;s skill ,
in space to move in all directions , no matter where he is turned , or even as he rot@@ ates .
of course it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of eight prop@@ ellers .
a lot is available in models , the rest is met directly when flying .
let us see that .
when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate twin propeller aircraft .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other against clock@@ wise .
when you assembled them , they are like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , something wrong - a motor or propeller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- can also fly the machine when limited .
we will demonstrate that , by making a half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration examined synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables an aesthetic expression .
we took standard micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each individual weighs less than a slice of bread -- and out@@ fit them with local technology and algorith@@ ms .
each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hop@@ efully , you will motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine there would like to be a flying lamp screen on Broadway .
of course it is difficult to say the influence of this technology .
for types like us , the wages in the development and workers of workers .
it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that there is creative , wise sk@@ et@@ ches allowed to form them in a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such a massive professional and economic potential , the bag is on the i .
thank you very much .
more than 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes collap@@ sed in a very far distant galax@@ y , they turned the mass three times in a ten@@ ths of pure energy .
this short moment , it brigh@@ tened brigh@@ ter than all stars together in all galax@@ ies of the whole universe .
it was a very great pop .
however , their energy do not expos@@ e them into the form of light --
we finally speak of black soldering .
the entire energy was put into space @-@ time @-@ ge@@ aring itself and explo@@ ded the universe in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we arrange the events at first time .
even more than 1.3 billion years ago , there was even more multilingual life on Earth .
since then the earth has a lot more coral : coral , fish , plants , sau@@ rier , people , and -- God stand up with -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group especially cour@@ age@@ ous -- R@@ ai Weiss decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
most held them for crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy Gen@@ o@@ ies so that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed its idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely much hard work they built the detector L@@ IG@@ O : laser @-@ Inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ ry @-@ Observatory .
in the follow @-@ up time , the precision of L@@ IG@@ O could considerably increase the detection performance enorm@@ ously improved .
therefore it is called Advanced L@@ IG@@ O now .
in early September 2015 , L@@ IG@@ O was launched for a last test run to clari@@ fy some smaller , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the detector , gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ mat@@ ured black holes passed through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hug@@ hes : only two moments in my life were emotional than that :
the birth of my daughter
and the goo@@ db@@ ye to my father &apos;s father .
basically , people were the fruits of my life .
all this I had worked for I am not longer Science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hug@@ hes , theoretical physi@@ cist on the MIT . he has studied gra@@ vit@@ ational waves in black holes and their trans@@ servat@@ ories as L@@ IG@@ O meas@@ ur@@ able signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a forces in the gradient of space and time .
when passing the shaft , the space and its entire contents are stretched into one direction and stretched into the other .
for illustr@@ ative do@@ z@@ ers in courses of the theory of rel@@ ativity often have a properly al@@ ber@@ y dance .
&quot; expand and dust , stret@@ cher and dust . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
on September 14 , for example , each of us extends and stopped at the asc@@ end of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that means 20 zer@@ os after the com@@ ma , followed by 1 . therefore we explained the L@@ IG@@ O staff for crazy .
having a five @-@ kilometer long laser detector , and this is already ab@@ sur@@ d , this length would be measured in less than a thous@@ and@@ ths of the radius of a nuclear service . this is gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k .
at the end of his classic text on grav@@ itation
described K@@ IP Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt for the waves like this : &quot; the technical difficulties when construction of such detectors are massive .
but physi@@ cist are fin@@ alized and with the support of the public will be overcome all obstacles . &quot;
Thor@@ ne released this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to L@@ IG@@ O . Scott claims , L@@ IG@@ O was more one ear than one eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than things around us : face lifts , the size of your mobile phone .
that is quite convenient . for example , you can create a picture or a map of things by taking the out of several points coming light around you .
in killing it is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters .
this is why it is very difficult to produce a picture of things that mean you especially much :
to the face of your child .
instead we listen to certain properties like the pitch and level , rhythm and volume to close behind it .
&quot; now just Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob supp@@ resses them . &quot;
&quot; drummer Bob &quot; .
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we can do not produce any simple pictures of objects in all .
but in regard to changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to us their stories .
at least , the measured frequencies are at least for L@@ IG@@ O .
when we convert wave pattern to sound , we can listen to all this literally .
to listen to the grav@@ itation , we can betra@@ y us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes with which my colleague Scott has already been busy very long .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , zir@@ cons simple : w@@ up@@ p !
rotate the two body very quickly , one hears the same cir@@ cus with an additional audio change . that list@@ ens to : W@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u !
it is a kind of motion @-@ shot , drawn into the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that must never forget -- heard L@@ IG@@ O : &#91; Sur@@ render of the sound &#93; No one , which knows what he must hear , recogni@@ zes this as a noise of -- SH : ... two black holes each with 30 @-@ fold sun@@ ba@@ the mass , which are approximately as fast as the bars of your sh@@ aker .
AA : we think about what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in all , one with a mass of 29 rop@@ es , the other with a mass of 36 rop@@ es , revol@@ ve each one hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine that forces .
fantastic .
and we know it because we have heard it .
this is the lasting meaning of L@@ IG@@ O .
L@@ IG@@ O has a completely new way to explore the universe , as it was never before .
on this way we can listen to the All and listen to the invisible .
much in all we can not see -- practically or basically --
a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why the stars in super nov@@ as explo@@ de .
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about all of them .
but the exciting physical processes are to be hidden in the core , which lies behind thousands of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see , since this op@@ ak are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ro@@ cking iron , as it would be transparent glass . the ur@@ ine would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it , since the ur@@ ine is covered by his own afternoon .
using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible until the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that we have never seen in all things that we have never seen , and of which we have never seen no idea . things we can only see that we listen .
in fact , L@@ IG@@ O found the first of all things that we had not expected .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the L@@ IG@@ O project , says on this topic : ME : the kind of stars that caused black holes , such as L@@ IG@@ O them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient body from prehistoric times . the black holes are so to speak the sau@@ erk@@ raut for our ar@@ che@@ ological work .
L@@ IG@@ O enables us to view a completely different view to the events in all , on the emergence of the stars , and ultimately , as we went out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge now consists of as cour@@ age@@ ous as possible .
thanks to L@@ IG@@ O we know how to build great detectors and cos@@ mos the cos@@ mos of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new Ob@@ servat@@ ories -- a brand new generation of Ob@@ servat@@ ories on Earth and All .
for what could be more beautiful than the ur@@ ine ?
now the time of great dreams is now .
dreams with us .
thank you .
some time I tried an experiment .
one year long I would say to all &quot; Yes ! &quot; I was afraid of whom I was afraid .
matter whether it caused me nerv@@ ous to say me in un@@ pleasant situations , I forced me &quot; Yes &quot; to say .
would I wish to talk to the public ?
no , but yes !
would I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
would I start playing with the scene ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a mad thing happened : exactly what was to do , w@@ ov@@ or I was afraid , removed my anxi@@ ety .
my fear , to keep speaking , my social anxi@@ ety -- Pu@@ ff , gone .
the Power of a Word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a particular Yes , which changed my life on an un@@ expect@@ edly . it started with a question of my infants .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett , and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls for un@@ explained reasons all &quot; concep@@ tions , &quot;
then she would be a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I need milk for my sp@@ ic@@ um@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she asked them once , if I was playing with her , when I was just on the go . and I said , &quot; yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new life setting in my family . from there I swe@@ ars to play with them as soon as you make me . no matter what I just do , or where I go , I say always yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m tired .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , on our family .
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I was really bad that the &quot; Yes &quot; s@@ ails to play with my children my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think of things that you know about life .
dream job .
no .
I am a titanium .
dream job .
I create TV . I produce television .
I &apos;m doing television , in large style .
in this TV @-@ season , I &apos;m responsible for that 70 hours of program put into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours television . three to four shows are at the same time in production .
each shipment provides hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can lie between three and six million dollars .
we say five .
a new episode every nine days , TV , four TV programs , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts , which are simultaneously in production , four episodes : Grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Balance , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours Television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America , my television series will run on Thursday night .
around the world , my series will run in 256 different languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is globally , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are ship@@ ments which I have created itself , and not only produced so far . I must find time , really silent , creative time to assemble my fans of Lag@@ bon@@ fires and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that burn around the world .
do you know who makes it yet ?
no one , so I am a titanium .
dream job .
I would not want to im@@ press them .
I tell it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you that all of you who are so hard to work , if you have a company , a country or a class@@ room , that you can understand that I am not only on your computer , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that there is not a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all the blood , everything swe@@ at -- no tears .
I work much , hard and I love it .
if I deep@@ ens in work , there is no other sense .
my work is always created a country out of nothing .
it &apos;s , when I set up troops , then I painted on a screen .
how do we dream a high sound , lie@@ ve a marathon .
it feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love it to work .
it is creative , mechanically , exhau@@ sting and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ uous , funny and ste@@ ady , fierce and reasonable , fierce and reasonable . and the best to it , the sum@@ s is .
there is so a change in me if the work is good .
a sum@@ s begins in my head , and it grows up and growing , and the sum@@ s stops like an animated street , I could always go to her .
many people assume , if I speak the sum@@ s to them that I make sure that writing is enough to me .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , that does it .
but the sum@@ s -- when I started working with TV production when I began to work and work , to create and collabor@@ ate , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s , these energy .
the sum@@ s is more than this writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sum@@ s , then you can &apos;t go differently than according to size .
the feeling , not otherwise can be scattered , no matter what price .
it is called the sum@@ s .
or perhaps it means to be a Work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is called gen@@ ius .
perhaps it is called E@@ go .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know it .
I know only that I am not made for the failure , and I know that I love the sum@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I will only say to you , I am a titanium , and I know that I don &apos;t want to ask it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to make one clear : the more shows , each more episodes , the more work , the more works there , the more works at the same time , the more then I write history , more expectations there are so much more expectations .
the more I work to be successful , the more must work me .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , not true ?
the land , which I create , the marathon , I run , the army , the screen , the high clay , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s .
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I just this sum@@ s ?
and then stop the sum@@ s .
revised , ex@@ ert , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated .
the sum@@ s stop .
now my three daughters are acc@@ ust@@ omed to the truth that their m@@ om is a single employer .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ om will not be there , but you can write to my N@@ anny . &quot;
and Emer@@ son said , &quot; Un@@ titled , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da Land . &quot;
there are the children of a titanium .
they are baby @-@ titanium .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when sum@@ s up .
the sum@@ s of the engine dies .
I loved my work anymore . the engine was out .
the sum@@ s came not back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same Titan@@ en work , 15 hours @-@ days , continuous weekends , no Reu@@ ter , don &apos;t deleg@@ ate , a titanium sleeps doesn &apos;t exist , with all heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me silence was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a pre @-@ show @-@ Titan ,
everything was gray , I just didn &apos;t have fun .
and that was my life .
all that I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s was I .
so what do you do if you do , the work that you love , suddenly desp@@ air suddenly ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know , some like say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heu@@ l you from , bl@@ az@@ ing the author Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what to do , one loves to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker to be a teacher , a painter , Bill gates , one loves to be a teacher , if you knew the sum@@ s , if the sum@@ s will stop , who is it then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
if the song of my heart hear , I can survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; Southern States wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; Ask me a question .
I &apos;m on the way outside , too late and she says : &quot; m@@ om , do you play ? &quot;
and I already want to say , when two things are aware of :
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , I have to say Yes to all , and second , she called me not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they call no more &quot; estim@@ ony . &quot;
when is that happen ?
I leave it when I am Titan bin and my sum@@ s down , and here everything changes to my own eyes .
and so they say : &quot; m@@ om , do you play ? &quot;
and I say , &quot; yes . &quot;
it is nothing special .
we play and their sisters with it , we laugh a lot and I read all the very dramatic from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing exceptional .
but it &apos;s outstanding , because my pain and my pan@@ ic , in the lon@@ el@@ iness and in the absence of the Sum@@ mary , I can do nothing but to adapt .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the land , which I create , the marathon , I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they don &apos;t exist more .
everything that exists a st@@ icky finger and mo@@ ist kiss@@ es , delicate voices , wax p@@ enc@@ ils and song , in which it may go lot , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so close that I can hardly bre@@ athe .
I can hardly believe that I at@@ me .
play is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door goes back and an energy boost comes in .
and that &apos;s not immediately , but it happens to happen .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s comes slowly .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s silent , hardly audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel like a magical mystery .
but let us stay at the thing .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something that we have forgotten .
the sum@@ s , the work bench , the titanium surface , that &apos;s only the replacement .
if I ask you , who are you if I am you if I am sending my brain with the broad@@ casts and TV hours and how working my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum@@ s is .
the sum@@ s is no strength and it is not unemployed .
it is dependent on the joy .
the real sum@@ s depends on love .
the sum@@ s is the power that comes from the life of life .
the real sum@@ s is self @-@ awareness and peace .
the real sum@@ s igno@@ res the pressure of history , which is to do with anticip@@ ating tasks , anticip@@ ation and pressure .
the real sum@@ s is simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps whis@@ per@@ ed to me the wrong words , for what God told me that I am a titanium ?
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child will play with me , I will say Yes .
I &apos;m doing this for a fixed rule , so I can free myself as a Work@@ ah@@ olic of any gu@@ ilt .
it is Law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the sum@@ s again .
I wish it would be so simple . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
do not play any more about how to work .
the truth does hurt ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work , because I love it .
I am rather at the workplace as home .
this conf@@ ession is painful , because what a human being really working as a house ?
well , I , I .
hon@@ est@@ ly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too , is none of them .
we are around in the garden , before and back , and back .
we make small dance parties ,
we will sing and play Ball .
we dis@@ bur@@ ns soap bub@@ bles .
I feel mainly sti@@ ff , ab@@ dic@@ ating and conf@@ used .
I always go to my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how you lives , and the sum@@ s of the universe met me .
I play and play , until I ask myself : why have we ever heard with the games ?
you can also say it ! say they always say Yes , if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you will keep me for n@@ ai@@ v , for a meeting .
there you might be right but you can do it !
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et @-@ Show .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me until they would like to do something different .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ ir@@ fer or bis@@ cuit replaces me .
and my teenage daughter speaks for 15 minutes with me , I am mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , more need it not .
each can bring 15 minutes to the piece , even on a bad La@@ une @-@ day !
15 minutes on the piece !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no exhaust .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my well@@ being , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is to feel the sum@@ s to have a place for his soul fri@@ day .
it &apos;s not to play with your own children . it is about pleasure ,
to play the &quot; Games &quot; in general .
get the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out it and keep it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and win . friends meet , books read the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is short for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training when I wanted to sur@@ pass more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes on the piece , why not full 15 minutes walk ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my leisure time . the sum@@ s seems to return , if I do not work .
works not work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months a door open@@ eth , and I find me again in my office . I list@@ ened to new ideas . I list@@ ened to new ideas . I use my way again . I use it in full trains and love my work again .
I like the sum@@ s , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s isn &apos;t I ... no more .
bubble bl@@ asts and st@@ icky finger , dinner with friends .
this is my sum@@ s .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
the sum@@ s of work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so than@@ k@@ able .
it is me to me that I am a titanium . I have never seen one Titan , who plays a trip to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet , I still have everything in the handle . my brain is still working . my bon@@ fires are still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more feel I feel good .
the more I play , the clear@@ er my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the land that I run , the marathon , which I run , the high sound , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the right sum@@ s : the sum@@ s of life .
the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more makes this unusual , peaceful , naked and new life feeling in me wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel like this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am .
I am author . I think of things I think you know about life .
this belongs to the job , which means to live his dream .
this is the dream of this jobs ,
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Titan@@ en have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you nice .
I am Neuro@@ surgery .
like most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedy every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a severe stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geon is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to help themselves .
after a severe injury of the central nerv@@ ous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability .
this is the reason why I functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgery ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerv@@ ous functions through various surgical measures .
certainly they have heard of one of the best known , the &quot; deep @-@ cat@@ ch@@ stim@@ ulation . &quot; we im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neu@@ rolo@@ gic function improves .
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson , who suffered severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
however , Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon is the restoration of the brain .
we moved to this dream by my opinion .
I want to show you that we are very close .
with some help the brain can help themselves .
the history began 15 years ago .
at the time I was a senior leader and worked day and night in the emergency .
I often encoun@@ tered patients with skull @-@ trau@@ ma .
they must imagine that at the skull @-@ mil@@ n @-@ trau@@ mat@@ a the brain go@@ ose to the brain and the cran@@ ial pressure increases .
to save life , you have to reduce the cran@@ ial pressure .
at this moment , one must sometimes remove a portion of a portion of deer mass .
instead of the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse ourselves with Jean François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist , the brain mass .
what do I mean ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is no easy task .
cells of a tissue increase is comparable with all small children who are taken out of your families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , moisture and the environments to th@@ ri@@ ve them .
exactly this we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts he managed to Jean @-@ François .
this he saw under his micro@@ scope .
that was a great surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a family @-@ cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you know from the Bi@@ ological lessons that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can transform itself into each cell type of the organ@@ ism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in OP .
we did a further fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are imm@@ ort@@ al .
but these cells were different .
they divided slowly and after a few weeks , they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like the stem cells , but kept different .
we needed long to understand from whence they came .
they come from these cells .
this blue and red cells are called the Dou@@ b@@ lec@@ ort@@ in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our gran@@ cer@@ eb@@ rin@@ da cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in stage of the F@@ öt@@ us , they provide the folding of the brain .
but why do they receive us ?
we do not know that .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , since we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injury .
but this is not so safe .
however , a matter is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass in the non @-@ speaking area and then remove the cells exactly as cul@@ tured as it did Jean @-@ François
and then mark colour@@ less to watch them in the brain .
in the last step we im@@ planted them at the opening of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ ologist transplan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we re@@ im@@ planted these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re@@ im@@ planted the same cells in the wrong brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario we planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that she had been taken after some weeks , when they were already taken back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed there , so disappear .
in the second scenario , we met a violation of and re@@ im@@ planted the same cells and now the cells were up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were im@@ planted .
the proof to show them are these little points . these are the cells that we were in vitro , in the culture .
we could not stop , of course .
will these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain infr@@ in@@ gement ?
so , we trained Mon@@ keys with a manual page .
they had to take animal pellets from a tray .
they made it very well .
when they reached a stable level of sk@@ ill@@ ity level , we last in the motor home Cor@@ tex .
thus the monkeys were par@@ aly@@ zed , they could not move their hand anymore .
just as it would happen to humans , they recovered spont@@ ane@@ ously up to a certain degree , exactly like after a stroke .
the patients are par@@ aly@@ zed and then try to recover the plastic bra@@ id mechanisms . they recover at a certain degree , just like the monkey .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spont@@ aneous recovery , we im@@ planted its own cells .
on the left @-@ hand side you can see the monkeys so spont@@ ane@@ ously .
it may bring about 40 % to 50 % of its initial performance in front of injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now , when we im@@ planted the cells , the same monkey , two months after m@@ im@@ plantation .
I can tell you that were very exciting results for us .
since that time we found out much more about these cells .
we can freeze it and later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example Park@@ inson &apos;s Park@@ inson &apos;s .
but our dream is still to im@@ planted in humans .
I hope really that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know anyone who need it . &quot;
I definitely fall .
of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials in humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the greatest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , one needs to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass this kind of studies .
BG : that is under@@ stand@@ able , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it needs a long time , a lot of patience and a nearly professional team .
BG : look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start of clinical trials . if you &apos;re looking forward to the future , how many years it takes to get to the hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of clinical study .
will it allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
it already needs a long time to select the patient to perform treatments and evaluate it whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
after that , you have to apply this to a multi @-@ cent@@ ric study .
you have to think first at first , that it is useful before you can offer to each treatment .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting T@@ ED and that you are told us of it .
BG : many thanks .
democracy .
in the west , we make a big bug to consider them as of course .
we do not see democracy as the frag@@ ile plant which is in reality , but as inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as un@@ changeable encoder .
we believe that capitalism leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have des@@ per@@ ate that it is possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy around us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I chose Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ disp@@ uted to me as the Minister of Finance in the Euro@@ group -- that the democratic process of our country -- do not affect the au@@ ster@@ ity , which were implemented in Greece .
at this moment , I thought that there could be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my rising friends that would repeat for me when they would change democracy .
at this point I would like to present an economic model for real democracy .
I pray you , together with me to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake we could save the democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ ective democracy .
because without democracy , our companies are m@@ apped , our future dark and our great , new technologies .
I would like to refer to an interesting contra@@ diction which currently threat@@ ening our business operations .
I call it the &quot; twin Summit Par@@ ad@@ ox . &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the Scho@@ ol@@ berg , who th@@ rows its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all know the school of school ,
but only few are aware of its d@@ ym@@ us d@@ ym@@ us .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to anxi@@ ous savings and corpor@@ ations , however , it could be productive and income , where it might produce productive @-@ income and also all those things could produce that humanity are ur@@ gently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months were invested in the United States , in England and in the Eurozone , in all the wealth produced goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , streets , tracks , equipment , and so on .
after a lot of money , it sounds a lot of money until one compar@@ es with the 5,1 trillion U.S. dollars that remained at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing else , except for the stock exchange and real estate prices .
so , debts and un@@ productive capital make tw@@ ins that are not equal to the usual market mechanisms by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ n@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year old in the USA , Japan and Europe , and therefore a low overall economic demand that could not invest in which they could not invest . just like Ö@@ di@@ pus Father , who could not kill him that his son would kill him if he is growing ,
in@@ rolled the circumstances that lead to it that Ö@@ di@@ pus kill him .
this is my Ha@@ des with capitalism --
all of the un@@ productive capital should be deployed to improve our life , developing human talents , and especially to finance the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth .
is it a solution for democracy ?
but I think before we proceed : what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as a social form , in which the open and the poor as a majority of the government .
of course the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy closed too many of --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be an error to reduce the importance of ath@@ etic democracy in due to these in@@ clusions .
the decision on the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy was and is that they gave the working arms , and not only the right to free expression of opinion , but important and crucial , which they set the right to political mit@@ igation against questions of state .
the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy did not have a long time --
like a candle that illumin@@ ates very bright , it is also fast above .
however , our current demo@@ cra@@ cies did not have their roots in the ancient Athens ,
but in the Magna Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy focused on the free citizens , our liberal democracy based on the values of Magna Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a statute for ruling powers .
for the liberal democracy came only on , when a full separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was applied to politics during the economy -- thus the world of the corpor@@ ations -- a demo@@ c@@ lical free zone was observed .
at the time of today &apos;s Democrats since the time when the separation of politics and economy began , an un@@ inher@@ ited fight between the two instead of the economy and the economy gradually mig@@ rated to politics .
are you wonder@@ ing why the politicians are no longer like this ?
it is not a de@@ generation of their DNA .
it is about that one can be nowadays in the government today and still not in power because the power of politics came into the economy and the areas are separated .
I chose my Ha@@ des with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is in about like a herd of smo@@ kers , that is so sustainable the animals that nour@@ ishes itself , dec@@ im@@ ated that they are hungry at the end .
similarly , it is with the economy , which increases politics as far as well . the power of the corpor@@ ations grow , political goods are reli@@ eved , the economic demand falls and the general manager of the corpor@@ ations are decl@@ ining and the managing director of the corpor@@ ations are to be avoided , the cash of its company is to invest .
ever , the demo@@ s of capitalism , the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy , the higher will be the twin summit , and so much bigger the dis@@ appearance of human labor and prosper@@ ity of mankind .
if this is true , it is obvious that we must bring the policy and the economy again , and it would be better when the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; control is the control of the servants , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea .
the Marx@@ ist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it wasn &apos;t onder@@ ed good .
the doctrine of the Deb@@ ak@@ el of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms can only recover a position like in ancient Athens , without creating new species of brood and waste .
but there is a solution : create the working arms !
capitalism do it by replacing low @-@ wage employed by automation and robot .
the problem is , so long economy and politics are separate areas , the automation will be higher , and the social conflicts can be higher , as it is already very soon as I think -- in countries such as China will come .
so we need to un@@ ite the economy and the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we democr@@ atically ph@@ ili@@ ze the un@@ compatible field , otherwise we will show the film &quot; Matrix &quot; as a documentation .
the question is not whether capitalism is the technical achievements which he has created , survive --
the most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a D@@ yst@@ opia similar to &quot; Matrix &quot; , which will be replaced by the society in &quot; Star Trek &quot; in the machines , or put their energy into the research of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long discussions the sense of life .
I think we may be optim@@ istic .
so what would it like to look like this &quot; Star Trek &quot; -@@ like ut@@ opia rather than the &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ like D@@ yst@@ eine ?
in the practical implementation , I would like to tell you some examples of some examples .
in the field of companies : please make a capital market in which you earned money while you are working and in which your capital will follow you from a company to the next , and the company -- whether you are just working -- is property of those who currently work in the company .
then all income from capital and redemption , and the concept of wage work is completely overhau@@ led .
no differentiation between those whom the companies belong to work , but employees who do not hear there , but no di@@ pping more between capital and work , no major g@@ aps between investment and sp@@ ades , and ultimately no possible tw@@ ins .
in the area of global political economy : please make sure that our national currencies have had a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate in a universal , global , digital currency , which will be issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging econom@@ ies &#93; .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency , we call them &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; &apos; -- and every government pays the sum that complies with the trade deficit or trade in the respective country .
imagine that this fund has invested in &quot; green &quot; technologies , particularly in parts of the world , in which investment funds are ra@@ r .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Ke@@ yn@@ es proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
today we have it , especially in front of the background of a united policy and economy .
the world , which I described you is simultaneously liber@@ alized , in which they preferred privileged individuals and mar@@ x@@ ically , because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the tr@@ ash@@ can of history , and ke@@ yn@@ es@@ ian , globally ke@@ yn@@ es@@ ian .
but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
are we awak@@ ening in such a world
or are we to sink in a &quot; Matrix &quot; - similar D@@ yst@@ eine ?
the answer depends on how we decide to choose polit@@ ically .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we do it better .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Y@@ an@@ is ...
you submit yourself in your biography yourself as liberal Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Y@@ an@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have said just said , Marx is relevant .
the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy ... do we do that , the technological development will generate a massive decline in overall economic demand , which Larry Sum@@ mers referred to as &quot; long @-@ term stag@@ nation . &quot;
by the transfer of this crisis of one part of the earth to the next , as we currently experience it , it will not only be able to dest@@ abil@@ ise our Democrats , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant ,
likewise , as Hay@@ ek , so I am an liber@@ ality of Marx@@ ist , and like Ke@@ yn@@ es , and therefore I am perfect .
BG : indeed , and now we are doing it .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t make it , you think not enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said this . BG : in your lecture , you said Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the Red@@ ner you have very clear what you think from the point of view of the West in China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a large size of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democracy we have received the certificate of democracy .
as I said in my speech , we have limited democracy on policy , while the area where most of the economy plays , -- the area of the economy -- a fully demo@@ c@@ lical free zone .
in some resp@@ ects , if I may say that so pro@@ voc@@ ative words , China resem@@ bles the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to connect to liber@@ alism with democracy -- that &apos;s an error , historically regarded .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ al , as John Stuart Mill --
he was especially sk@@ ep@@ tical , aff@@ ecting the democratic development .
what one can see now in China , resem@@ bles very similar development which we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China now to do that what the West has done itself in the 19th century , sm@@ ells great after hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure that many list@@ eners were curious about your experiences as the Minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I noticed that this comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back on the first half of months later ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , out of personal visibility , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing , because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; namely , of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to adopt the euro@@ zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to adopt a massive failure line through the Eurozone , and continues to tackle the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity to reveal the first suggest@@ ion -- the first proposal to reveal this den@@ ial --
unfortunately it is right to do . unfortunately , the powers have chosen within the euro zone , continue to den@@ ying the den@@ ial .
but you know what comes .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if one tries to receive an economic system , which is not over@@ li@@ able to obtain through political will and authority of mil@@ itar@@ ism , you may have a while without delay , but if the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rupt@@ ly and destroyed .
BG : what changes do you see ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future , if we do not change their structure .
BG : did you have any fault in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back - seri@@ ousness ...
if there is a Minister of Finance , or any minister , who , after 6 months in office , especially in a so @-@ called situation , claims that he did not make mist@@ akes , then it is a dangerous person .
of course I did mist@@ akes .
the greatest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the training program at the end of February .
I believed that there was a hon@@ est interest on pages of the Money which gave a common solution .
but that was not .
they wanted to bring only our government , only because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the publ@@ ishers who ran through the Eurozone .
they didn &apos;t want to stand out that they had a cat@@ astroph@@ ic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
it is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
none of the Tro@@ ika of the Money which gave us this policy , and a : &quot; it was a Colom@@ bian mist@@ akes . &quot;
BG : despite all the , and despite the aggressive tone of talks , you don &apos;t seem to be quite European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone compared to someone who lives and loves Europe .
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone did not survive .
for if they do not survive , the redund@@ ant tile forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not have cat@@ astroph@@ ic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the most powerful economy of the world .
if we propose to strike the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , then it will be also available for the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ European .
BG : we hope that you &apos;re lying wrong with this point .
Y@@ an@@ is , thank you very much that you were at T@@ ED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
by Roy Price , most still heard , although he is responsible for 22 @-@ 10 minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 .
probably for 22 very enter@@ taining minutes , but not for many of you .
this goes back to the decision to hit the Roy three years ago .
Roy Price is a leader employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , stream@@ lined , has an icon and describes on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for producing the shows and content that will produce the Amazon .
of course , this is a very hard fought branch .
there are already so many TV series that Roy is not able to choose .
he must find shows that are very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are all right on this curve .
this curve is the evaluation division of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB &apos;s website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are preserved .
if your show is rated with nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows such as &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that have seen a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this type of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows shows such as &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- that should tell you what about this end of the curve .
Roy Price does not worry about the left side of the curve because I think you already need special intelligence to teach &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts on the middle suspension , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they are not inspir@@ ing .
so , he must ensure that he really is on the right side .
the pressure is present and of course it is the first time that Amazon is so something that Amazon makes nothing ris@@ ky .
he wants to create successes .
he needed guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses through a evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and will make them online wherever they can watch free .
and if Amazon exists for nothing , you get right ?
millions of visitors are viewing this episodes .
however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team to record everything .
you capture , when you start the show when you p@@ au@@ ated , which parts it jumps , or check again .
you collect millions of data to decide on these data they should produce them .
in fact , they collect the data , process these and from this is the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ Com for the republi@@ can US @-@ Sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many to remember this show because it was not so good .
it &apos;s only an average show -- at the true sense of the word -- because the average of these curve 7.4 is 7.4 and Alpha House end@@ anger@@ ed at 7.5 -- so somewhat above the average , but not just what Roy and his team worked .
about at the same time for another company , another manager has chosen a top @-@ show by data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the Manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . exactly how Roy is always looking for finding this a super @-@ show and it also uses data for it , but he makes it something different .
instead of a competition , he and his team had the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews that they give the shows , their course , which shows it like etc .
then they use these data to find out this small details about the audience : what shows it like producer , which actors .
when they had together all the parts , they went a wagon , and decided to make a sit@@ Com about four Sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,1 rating on this curve . so exactly there where they wanted .
of course , the question is : what happened here ?
it has two very competent , data experienced companies .
they combine these many data and it works great for one of them but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because the logic states that all should work in all .
if one collec@@ ts millions of data , for a decision that will be met , then you should make a good decision .
one has 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimized by a very powerful computer .
the least thing that you can expect is good television , or ?
if data analysis doesn &apos;t work , then this is something special , because we live in a time , in which we are more and more to statistics to meet serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes in contact with this software . come in contact , you are in jail .
if anyone asks here in the US and in order to retri@@ eve it , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release is made or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad will be decided if a person is good or bad .
middle television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but still more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that these data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results . that &apos;s not what a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data of the dates are also wrong .
yes , even Google does not make mist@@ akes .
in 2009 Google announced that it is possible through data analysis of influenza , the worst way to predi@@ ct -- through data analysis of the Google search .
it worked wonder@@ fully and was a great news release . the success met in a publication in the journal Nature . &quot;
it worked fine , year around year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation in the journal Nature . &quot;
even the data of the most experienced firms such as Amazon and Google will sometimes understand anything .
despite all these errors , data is decre@@ asing in decisions of life a -- at the workplace , in the law en@@ forcement , in medicine .
so we should make sure that data is helpful .
also I know many difficulties with data . I work in the computer @-@ based genet@@ ics -- an area where some very smart people are un@@ imagin@@ able many data to meet serious decisions as decision for a cancer treatment
or the development of a drug . over the years I detected some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be widespread .
do you have to solve one complex problem , do not do two things :
first , write this problem in its single parts , so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as second , use the single parts again to receive a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and put together .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help solve one problem and understand his parts .
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we all have all : our brain .
if there is something when the brain is good , it is parts and pieces again , even if the information is in@@ complete , in order to hold a good decision -- especially if the brain is an expert .
therefore , I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and understanding , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to understand their audience , for what else could it be unable . but the decision , how to put all these parts again , and it makes a show how &quot; House of Cards &quot; makes it not in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they entered a large personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , however , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first as they contest TV ideas , then choose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
it was a secure decision because they always say : &quot; they say the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful to better decisions but I think that things wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are only one tool , and around that not to forget is this device pretty useful .
many of you will ...
before it was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions using a J@@ a- or no @-@ question , you only need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; highly likely &quot; -- exactly here at this moment .
I will start it later with a technique demo .
I have previously made some decisions in my life , whereby I should hear the ball in the after@@ ward .
but how you &apos;re sure to know if you have the data available , you would like to replace these through something much , as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic construction .
so perhaps the ball cl@@ ü@@ ger and kl@@ ü@@ ger . ultimately it lies on us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right curve .
and I am more sensitive to meet this than encour@@ aging message that despite the great amount of data still pays out to make decisions as an expert in what you do , and risks .
because at the end , it is not the data , but the risks , with which you landing at the right end of the curve .
thank you nice .
