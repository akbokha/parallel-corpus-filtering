<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize for the New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone heard from Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book, in which he published its spectacular that NSA had illegal telephones from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a permanent impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence service in which the CIA was literally superimposed for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If the crazy sounds, you read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know, who did not know the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For nearly 10 years, the government has determined against Risen and asked him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train, he was to condemn the symbol of the government to condemn Whistlebars and journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the first review, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to use this right when media cannot get this information and if they cannot protect identity of the muffles that they give.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government was at Risen, he did something that many brave reporters were already before him: he refused, saying that he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the process, something unusual.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they are too long for years that it would be indispensable for their case, the government's demands were dropped to Risen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, the reporter and sources may always be hedges.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of fails and awnings to make statements, this could also do his digital footsteps for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so, the investigations, without his understanding, worried about his telephone calls,</seg>
<seg id="21">As well as its e-mail data, financial and banking information, his credit card, and even travel activities with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-Whistlively and risk.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised him to protect Whistories. but instead, the justice convicted more than all U.S. governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how that can be a problem, especially because the government is too much of their work as a home.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article about national safety was the result of that a Whistlebars went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So, we set the press work on the game that should be protected by the first constitutional complaint because the government has more possibilities to choose all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as the technology of the government permits to handle the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better.</seg>
<seg id="29">And although they can contact the moment, in which they receive contact, rather than in the afterward.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, there are communication software that had not yet been written down as the isen book, and it is much more safer than normal e-mails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">An technology is Securedrop, an open source transfer system for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet's famous Aaron Swartz, and is now being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I have been working.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of send an e-mail, go to a news site, such as the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information as with any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">This will be encrypted and stored on a server, which only has access the relevant message agency.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can do no more information secretly, and many of the information that they would like would not be available from advance.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom of the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments of all over the world will always develop new spy-technologies that all endangered.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is in us to ensure that not only technology controls such as Edward Snowden have an opportunity to apply missilently. it is just important that we protect the next Whists,</seg>
<seg id="39">The over abuse during the supply of soldiers complying and reported by overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental worker, the alarm to conceal water from Flint. or a Wallstreet-Insider, who warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies have not only been made for those who want to expose crimes, but to protect the rights of all constituents.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016, the largest data collection of the history is published.] [the "Panama Papers" reveal that the rich and Mighty] have been hidden by Global Witness to have a declaration.] this week we asked by News about a Leck of 11 million documents of the law firm Mossack Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of the tax-rabbits.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers to companies such as Mossack Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you do it?"</seg>
<seg id="45">In fact, we really see emails, the exchange of messages like the entire system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister is back.</seg>
<seg id="48">There is also reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Baschar al-Assad letter companies in tax evens has.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a track of $2 billion to Russia's President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend of children's days, a famous Cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people and others to wait nervous to the next release, and to the next unveil documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of an agency or a John-Grisham-ROM.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems wine from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and mighty are able to hide their assets in tax evens and not all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that applies to us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these presses are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In all over the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax evens of some few are used to hide their wealth and swallowed up -- something that we have been discussing for ten years and unveil.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people appear very confusing this whole world, and it is difficult to understand such as these control phases will work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always take it like an Matryoshkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one company has a company in another company, in another company which makes it almost impossible to understand, who is behind this building.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for criminal prosecution and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what it is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it is interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably because there were no prominent Americans so far in these abstentions, that Skandal arrived.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not so that there is no rich Americans that their wealth in tax-rabbits are hedges.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by principle, after which these control phases work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data base of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that you need to specify less information in some US states to form a company than to get a company library.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the US has allowed to finish school children from school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It offers fraudsters to finish especially anticulated feeder.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behaviour that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this is in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent an investigator in the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator gave himself as a African Minister, who wanted to bring suspects money into the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked that all till an advocate of our investigator proposals, how he could transfered his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all preventures. none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course no one was given to us money. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about any individual lawyer, who spreadout investigations into our covered investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">It does not work for a single top politiker, wrapped in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is because the system works, by corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to handle this, we need to change the rules of the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We must change the rules to make this kind of behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may really sound really sound, as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing ever had changed; as if it will always have the rich and mighty.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a native optimistic, I really see that some change has begun.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the past few years we have seen a lot more transparency to see what the owners are concerned.</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU measures in central registers at national level, who really is behind companies in Europe, and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US died here.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both Parliament chambers, but this does not make progress that we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how this Panama disables, this huge insight into the world of tax evens, used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and global.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are wasted if they see how other people can hide their true identity behind lights.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need managers in the economy, which stand and say, "Intransparent is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who recognize the problem and continue to end through the laws of this kind of transparent.</seg>
<seg id="95">Together we can now terminate the intransparency, which now does this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I was abducted almost immediately and in the trunk area of a red Mazdas had to be landed.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I completed my designer studies, I made a rear sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A type in red Mazda stayed and looked upon my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my art works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country. thereafter he would go to peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where do you sleep today?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing even worse: "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just didn't know him! he says he would not go to the peace corps, but I don't know if he is really planning. I don't have kidnapped in the boot of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard myself: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "You like?" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">In the night I was in bed, I starred to the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what happened to me there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wildman sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if it is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I went out of bed, on toast tips to the door, and my sleep door closed.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The art works that he had purchased from me today is in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as host. it has changed my viewing angle.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold me in childhood than strangers were sold, actually friends that are only waiting for it to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">People living on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">We make a time jump, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I'm unemployed, almost pleite, my roommates, and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe, creativity can make it to transform in fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommates Brian Chesky: "Brian, I did surprise how we might make something to make. our apartment is equipped to a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, WLAN and a desk including, with a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a site and founded so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRB and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on a wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we also.</seg>
<seg id="132">"" "" "" "I'm sure that our cheese-ham-Omelee tasted completely different because we made them for our guests." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured to them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest and the door in the castle, Brian and I joined us.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our hire?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into rolls.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommates, nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to figure out whether they could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented the investors: "we want to create a site, on the people publicly traded pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms, whose doors closes when you come pass.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can then invite a foreign people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the missile would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But did he do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still at comfort would have been investing in a business, which is allowed to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we have learned all children, strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you'll get in the things that can be good. we are able to design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts we had learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the total experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to designs objects, but now we wanted to create through design immoral confidence between people who never had before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford anything?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create with design confidence?</seg>
<seg id="151">I wish to give you a sample sample, what degree trust we control.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will be scaled out of your comfort.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up, if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlock mobile phone your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent flight from panic you will feel - -- is exactly what hosts feel the door if they open the door.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, you can see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked cell phone of a stranger in the hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So feel most guests, if they stay in differently.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason, our company may exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so, who actually has Al Gores's mobile?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you declare on Twitter that he diminated for the Office of the Presidents?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the cell phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">They now have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build. I want to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we have changed a little detail in that experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had taken place once again with his name, if he had told, where he comes, how his dog or his children be called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you have 150 assessments who say all: "he really can hold very well unlocked cellphones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when using your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning, we have done some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult to cover the people to negatively.</seg>
<seg id="175">Ultimately, we decided to wait until both hosts as well as guest had given their findings before we set them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We have performed with Stanford a study. we examined how probably it is that people trust one another, depending on how they are similar to the ages and housing.</seg>
<seg id="178">A little surprisingly we trust the people most, which are most popular.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less confidence we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social Voreproof.</seg>
<seg id="181">It is exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If one has less than three divisions change, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But it has more than ten, changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation for similarities from.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us to overcome some of our deep roots.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we drove that confidence is dependent on how much one is priced.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If one tells too little, such as "Hi!," you don't get an answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">One tells you how to say: "I have problems with my mother" -- -- the request is not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g. "Tolle art works in your apartment! I do with my family vacation."</seg>
<seg id="191">How to create it with design, how to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the right quantity text. we also give tips to which topics should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our advantages over the foreigner.</seg>
<seg id="194">With which we had not counted, was the great amount of people who were more than ready to push this preface.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">One can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: unbelievable good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need that was not covered previously.</seg>
<seg id="200">The shop is very good for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything is smooth.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who celebrated unpermitted parties or dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts will leave guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I have worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood in front of front when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than those calls. there is already hurt if I think it only.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment, which was heard in the voice of the call, was also always our largest motivation to improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Luckily, only a fraction of the 123 million overnights only had a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trusted one to another.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust works, miracle will arise.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. he suffered a heart attack there.</seg>
<seg id="212">His hosts drove him to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travellers who tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are genuine protective gel that save a life although they don't know it right.</seg>
<seg id="218">They ride a car in the hospital if you dies, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want that one feels good, they bring books.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer, without charge the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course not any stay is running.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money reaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">I asked for the first time about this term, I asked me:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of a submerged with money interactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is a economic trade here.</seg>
<seg id="227">But it's just just "rental industry" to name, the thing is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People lay a part of itself, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">If one travels from today, it is efficient and reliable, but it is efficient and reliable, but this is less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">However, if trips a rich buffet from local inpress would be?</seg>
<seg id="232">What would be, if in every place you visited, a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and one at a bar tour, from which you have never heard it;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could cook cooking of a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Today, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What would, if we would like to share apartments of the ground to shared use?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What would, if cities would have taken the idea of a common share?</seg>
<seg id="238">I'll introduce cities to help us society and relationships, instead of loneliness and restorying.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korean capital, Seoul, this project started already. lots of parking spaces that belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">The residents were offered now. students who were looking for a lead in search of a lead.</seg>
<seg id="241">Were mediated to people whose children were gone out. incubators have been started,</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be host to a stranger or self-host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems to be so crazy about how it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We are not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality also gave it before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has just our works?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and Timing, we realized that we can find the right design with the components of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us to overcome deep roots.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find it blossess,</seg>
<seg id="251">Just to overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it if a red Mazda is over to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course, we know that design can't solve each problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it was able to help us if it had this great influence, I ask myself what we can use for design.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you watch me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A faithful? a expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, underwear a terror underwear?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">That is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the guilt for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So, the media is the same as I look like.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of coverage of Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Presumably the people do not speak with their Uber-drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never learned one Muslims: it is great to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee maker -- Double Espresso, with whipped cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am the strapped,</seg>
<seg id="271">A sealegern fitness fanaticine,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I'm an practicing, spiritual Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not as Lady Gaga sing, because, baby, I was not so born.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to help me.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I met the decision to ouched me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as Muslims. I decided to wear the Hijab, my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified: "why do you suppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">The Lustle was: at that time it was a feminist Declaration of Independence, and in contrast to the pressure that I felt as 17-year-old felt me to match a perfect and inable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only thought the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have with the coran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought after, exhibited in question, doubted and believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship to God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was trust and slow devotion to deepening themselves with each reading of the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythmic brings me sometimes to weeping.</seg>
<seg id="285">I know myself. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel the feeling that someone claims you really understands, but somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">So it feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and started how all the good Egyptians, my career as engineering.</seg>
<seg id="289">I had later, after my marriage, a child, and lived in the "Egyptian-American dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then the terrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of them remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had finished at the end, looked upon the screen and saw the word "Eilsign."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, aircrafts flew into buildings, people spurs out of buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">An technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned to indignation quickly in indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do so something?</seg>
<seg id="299">"" "I moved to the television channel and heard:" ""... "Muslim terrorists..." ""... "in the name of Islam..." ""... "" ""... "" ""... "" "..." "" "</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not only attacking my country, but in the Nu turned me to suspects the works of others from a citizen in a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and begin with the postgraduate course.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember what I did -- when we had silent -- as deep it went into my seat, and I feared the first time as Muslims were recognized.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment in this night in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And when I heard, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic-speaking organizations that had said: "be careful," Be careful, "unlit in well lit," the assemblies are not deceived. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed all the week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday in that week -- the day that Muslims were gathered to the prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"" "and again the warnings:" "" "does not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were comprehenvious and I heard also of attacks on Muslims, or of men who held for Muslims, and slew them.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really branched on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something felt really felt right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because people who attacked this country have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have turned the rage of the people to the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It's not easy to explain the continuous self.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">There are the allegations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today we can say to people: "there is a problem in that country -- it's Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to ban Muslims and Mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my municipality as of a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It's just the question: are we malignant or bad?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malicious tumor can be removed as a whole and a benign tumor one keeps only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the USA, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, helpers and Olympionials.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of Mosques America safe?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be a couple of parking spaces, but not to stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to identify people other faith, and to show bigger citizen participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the area of Washington, D.C. recently told: people are actually not in mosques radicalised.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">At the radio process you've found that it is online. as the first, the person is cut out of their church, that the extremes group may believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behaviour and their ideology is absent or fallen by faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still speaking, Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS its brood-ality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As Muslims, as a mother, as a man, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would have to insert into their preference world, if you know it as a representative of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam, like the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology reasons for their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">But when you cast a look at her, they do not drive out what they are in their "Holy Scripture."</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brood-ality that they can read these things into the Scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl arrived in him because they had pre-given to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she was in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was exactly the opposite. each clergy, with whom they had spoken, she brought her to silence, and told her, her sense of unrighteousness in the world, they would have only gotten in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">It was inspired by nothing, and something that had had her Wut sense, it was a main goal for the instrumentalization through extremists who spoke a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam presented the connection to God and their church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accuse them for their groove, he showed her constructive paths for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What they learned in the mosque, they kept to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">That was an insight, like the Islamophobia and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it work on normal American?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it work on every other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24 hour use fear of fear every day on our democracy?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually, several neuroscientiative studies - show: if we fear, pass at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">We accept rather an authoritarian government system, conformity and advantages.</seg>
<seg id="360">One study shows: if you have reported test individuals, in which negative about Muslims was reported, they rather than military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look at the mood against Muslims after the above -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the lead of Iraq war and during two electoral periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So, Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction on Muslim terrorism, as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It is actually a tool for manipulation to the public to express the foundation of a free society, which has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">The handling of Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We might feel it as the first but the toxic air of fear fell to us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collective debt, it is not just therefore to explain himself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple that lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the Faculty of Medical Faculty, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he was the most generous person who knew it.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her own life. she was blossy and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when is such a young man from my breasts?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne with her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was in the afternoon. he did it in their apartment as with a execution after he had posted to Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shoss eight times to Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanatiism can not only be unmorally, but also deadly.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we walked to the mosque, or we stayed at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us there was no light decision, because it was going to overlook forward that America we would like to check our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can exercise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided to get to the Mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the kindergarten, we drove silent, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, when my shoes went out, went into the prayer hall, and what I saw, let me hold.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was restless filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam appealed, and our guests welcomed us, because the half of the gathered were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who were come, not to attack us but to help us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I am collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you be interested in the moment of fear and fanatiism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Are you going to go on a number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you connect to those that are: we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you nice!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have a Nerv.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what they say that you may say that you are a TEDTalk, a monument with a deep-run monument, so an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahered: I would say, you don't know. I'm totally normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am not an exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I'm as usual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">If one can look at the Muslims on all over the world, and I did that with the largest ever carried out study on Muslims in the whole world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want to do well for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I'm not an exception in no respect.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people like an exception to rule, then the rule is usually broken, and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahered.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began to be a platform for Basters, just a few before.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. possible in research institutions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air-packet in our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft engines at the Frac Centre in France has built up a six metre high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago they started to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting flight devices, high speed and acceleration on a narrow space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build independently adjustable structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">You have learned to wear loads with turbulences and to react differently to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of the possibility in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">This means that a system autonom works, it needs to know collectively, where the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic work.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new location technology of Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There is no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each air machine has internal sensors to determine position in the room, calculations on board, what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">External commands are available in the highest image such as "start" and "landen."</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called hedge starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight machine, which tries to beat two flying with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in advance, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most of the starters, it can be hewed, and it has great benefits at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However there is always a miter page.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of hedging is that they react sensitively to turbulences such as wind turbines.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight device is no matter what is the optimal position, and the performance can be improved due to practice.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay. okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions, to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be for example: what is the smallest possible number of movable parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for this to know the answer to one such question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known for about machines with a thousand moving parts that are gathering together to violate you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, drivers were flying remote controlled flight devices that only had two movable parts: a propellers and a tailgate.</seg>
<seg id="435">So far, we discovered that flying with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the Monospinner, the mechanically simplest remote control unit. it was invented in case recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It only has a movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No valves, hinges and transverse, no further actuator or control surfaces, only a propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, the inner life happens very much, so it can be stable and move in space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have an elegant algorithm of the tailgate. to fly it to fly, I must throw it exactly right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood to throw it exactly right now, is small, so I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the Monospinner is a practice in combulation, this machine is here, the Omnihead with its eight propellers, one exercise in overflow.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this flow?</seg>
<seg id="444">You see that it is only symmetric.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore, it is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result he receives the auditorium's skill,</seg>
<seg id="447">In space to move in all directions, no matter where he is turned, or even as he rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">A lot is available in models, the rest is met directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate twin propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you assembled them, they are like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, something wrong - a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- can also fly the machine when limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate that, by making a half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examined synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables an aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took standard micro-Quadcopter -- each individual weighs less than a slice of bread -- and outfit them with local technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, you will motivate these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine there would like to be a flying lamp screen on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course it is difficult to say the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, the wages in the development and workers of workers.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder, how wonderful and magical our universe is, and that there is creative, wise sketches allowed to form them in a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such a massive professional and economic potential, the bag is on the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">More than 1.3 billion years ago, two black holes collapsed in a very far distant galaxy, they turned the mass three times in a tenths of pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment, it brightened brighter than all stars together in all galaxies of the whole universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very great pop.</seg>
<seg id="472">However, their energy do not expose them into the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black soldering.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was put into space-time-gearing itself and exploded the universe in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">We arrange the events at first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">Even more than 1.3 billion years ago, there was even more multilingual life on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has a lot more coral: coral, fish, plants, saurier, people, and -- God stand up with -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group especially courageous -- Rai Weiss decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational waves to search for gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most held them for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy Genoies so that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed its idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely much hard work they built the detector LIGO: laser-Interferometry-Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up time, the precision of LIGO could considerably increase the detection performance enormously improved.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced LIGO now.</seg>
<seg id="484">In early September 2015, LIGO was launched for a last test run to clarify some smaller, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the commissioning of the detector, gravitational waves of the two collimatured black holes passed through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional than that:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the goodbye to my father's father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, people were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All this I had worked for I am not longer Science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist on the MIT. he has studied gravitational waves in black holes and their transservatories as LIGO measurable signals. but what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a forces in the gradient of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When passing the shaft, the space and its entire contents are stretched into one direction and stretched into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustrative dozers in courses of the theory of relativity often have a properly albery dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"expand and dust, stretcher and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, each of us extends and stopped at the ascend of the waves. the elongation of an average person was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by 1. therefore we explained the LIGO staff for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">Having a five-kilometer long laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would be measured in less than a thousandths of the radius of a nuclear service. this is grotesk.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text on gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Described KIP Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, the hunt for the waves like this: "the technical difficulties when construction of such detectors are massive.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicist are finalized and with the support of the public will be overcome all obstacles. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne released this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott claims, LIGO was more one ear than one eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than things around us: face lifts, the size of your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="508">That is quite convenient. for example, you can create a picture or a map of things by taking the out of several points coming light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">In killing it is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">This is why it is very difficult to produce a picture of things that mean you especially much:</seg>
<seg id="512">To the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain properties like the pitch and level, rhythm and volume to close behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now just Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob suppresses them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"drummer Bob".</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can do not produce any simple pictures of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">But in regard to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to us their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least, the measured frequencies are at least for LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="521">When we convert wave pattern to sound, we can listen to all this literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">To listen to the gravitation, we can betray us about the collision of two black holes with which my colleague Scott has already been busy very long.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, zircons simple: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Rotate the two body very quickly, one hears the same circus with an additional audio change. that listens to: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of motion-shot, drawn into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that must never forget -- heard LIGO: [Surrender of the sound] No one, which knows what he must hear, recognizes this as a noise of -- SH:... two black holes each with 30-fold sunbathe mass, which are approximately as fast as the bars of your shaker.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: we think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in all, one with a mass of 29 ropes, the other with a mass of 36 ropes, revolve each one hundred times per second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine that forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">This is the lasting meaning of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO has a completely new way to explore the universe, as it was never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the All and listen to the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all we can not see -- practically or basically --</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why the stars in super novas explode.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about all of them.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical processes are to be hidden in the core, which lies behind thousands of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see, since this opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves rocking iron, as it would be transparent glass. the urine would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it, since the urine is covered by his own afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational waves, it should be possible until the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that we have never seen in all things that we have never seen, and of which we have never seen no idea. things we can only see that we listen.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, LIGO found the first of all things that we had not expected.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says on this topic: ME: the kind of stars that caused black holes, such as LIGO them, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are so to speak the sauerkraut for our archeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO enables us to view a completely different view to the events in all, on the emergence of the stars, and ultimately, as we went out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now consists of as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO we know how to build great detectors and cosmos the cosmos of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new Observatories -- a brand new generation of Observatories on Earth and All.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than the urine?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now the time of great dreams is now.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dreams with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">One year long I would say to all "Yes!" I was afraid of whom I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="556">Matter whether it caused me nervous to say me in unpleasant situations, I forced me "Yes" to say.</seg>
<seg id="557">Would I wish to talk to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Would I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Would I start playing with the scene?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a mad thing happened: exactly what was to do, wovor I was afraid, removed my anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear, to keep speaking, my social anxiety -- Puff, gone.</seg>
<seg id="565">The Power of a Word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a particular Yes, which changed my life on an unexpectedly. it started with a question of my infants.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett, and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls for unexplained reasons all "conceptions,"</seg>
<seg id="570">Then she would be a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "I need milk for my spicumbar." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked them once, if I was playing with her, when I was just on the go. and I said, "yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new life setting in my family. from there I swears to play with them as soon as you make me. no matter what I just do, or where I go, I say always yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, on our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I was really bad that the "Yes" sails to play with my children my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think of things that you know about life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create TV. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I'm doing television, in large style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV-season, I'm responsible for that 70 hours of program put into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours television. three to four shows are at the same time in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment provides hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">We say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days, TV, four TV programs, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts, which are simultaneously in production, four episodes: Grey's, 21 episodes: how To Get Away With Balance, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours Television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my television series will run on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">Around the world, my series will run in 256 different languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is globally, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are shipments which I have created itself, and not only produced so far. I must find time, really silent, creative time to assemble my fans of Lagbonfires and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that burn around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who makes it yet?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, so I am a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would not want to impress them.</seg>
<seg id="601">I tell it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you that all of you who are so hard to work, if you have a company, a country or a classroom, that you can understand that I am not only on your computer, and it's true when I say: I understand that there is not a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all the blood, everything sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work much, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">If I deepens in work, there is no other sense.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work is always created a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It's, when I set up troops, then I painted on a screen.</seg>
<seg id="608">How do we dream a high sound, lieve a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">It feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love it to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanically, exhausting and intoxicuous, funny and steady, fierce and reasonable, fierce and reasonable. and the best to it, the sums is.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is so a change in me if the work is good.</seg>
<seg id="614">A sums begins in my head, and it grows up and growing, and the sums stops like an animated street, I could always go to her.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume, if I speak the sums to them that I make sure that writing is enough to me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, that does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- when I started working with TV production when I began to work and work, to create and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this sums, these energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than this writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a sums, then you can't go differently than according to size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling, not otherwise can be scattered, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">It is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it means to be a Workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is called Ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know it.</seg>
<seg id="630">I know only that I am not made for the failure, and I know that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">"" "I will only say to you, I am a titanium, and I know that I don't want to ask it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="632">In order to make one clear: the more shows, each more episodes, the more work, the more works there, the more works at the same time, the more then I write history, more expectations there are so much more expectations.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more must work me.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, not true?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land, which I create, the marathon, I run, the army, the screen, the high clay, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then stop the sums.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, exert, exaggerated, exaggerated.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stop.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mom is a single employer.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mom will not be there, but you can write to my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson said, "Untitled, I want to go to Shonda Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">There are the children of a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby-titanium.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when sums up.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine dies.</seg>
<seg id="650">I loved my work anymore. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums came not back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same Titanen work, 15 hours-days, continuous weekends, no Reuter, don't delegate, a titanium sleeps doesn't exist, with all heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me silence was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a pre-show-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I just didn't have fun.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">All that I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums was I.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if you do, the work that you love, suddenly despair suddenly?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know, some like say," "" "Heul you from, blazing the author Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know what to do, one loves to be a teacher, a banker to be a teacher, a painter, Bill gates, one loves to be a teacher, if you knew the sums, if the sums will stop, who is it then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">If the song of my heart hear, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "Southern States waitress" Ask me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">I'm on the way outside, too late and she says: "mom, do you play?"</seg>
<seg id="673">And I already want to say, when two things are aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">"" "first, I have to say Yes to all, and second, she called me not" "" "" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="675">They call no more "estimony."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I leave it when I am Titan bin and my sums down, and here everything changes to my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">And so they say: "mom, do you play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say, "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">It is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and their sisters with it, we laugh a lot and I read all the very dramatic from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it's outstanding, because my pain and my panic, in the loneliness and in the absence of the Summary, I can do nothing but to adapt.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land, which I create, the marathon, I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they don't exist more.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists a sticky finger and moist kisses, delicate voices, wax pencils and song, in which it may go lot, or whatever the girl in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I atme.</seg>
<seg id="691">Play is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes back and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that's not immediately, but it happens to happen.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums comes slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it's silent, hardly audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us stay at the thing.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something that we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the work bench, the titanium surface, that's only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you, who are you if I am you if I am sending my brain with the broadcasts and TV hours and how working my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is no strength and it is not unemployed.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the power that comes from the life of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is self-awareness and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sums ignores the pressure of history, which is to do with anticipating tasks, anticipation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps whispered to me the wrong words, for what God told me that I am a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child will play with me, I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I'm doing this for a fixed rule, so I can free myself as a Workaholic of any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is Law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice if I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so simple. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Do not play any more about how to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth does hurt,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I am rather at the workplace as home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This confession is painful, because what a human being really working as a house?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too, is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We are around in the garden, before and back, and back.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We will sing and play Ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We disburns soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mainly stiff, abdicating and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always go to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how you lives, and the sums of the universe met me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play, until I ask myself: why have we ever heard with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! say they always say Yes, if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you will keep me for naiv, for a meeting.</seg>
<seg id="742">There you might be right but you can do it!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet-Show.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me until they would like to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a Marienkirfer or biscuit replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And my teenage daughter speaks for 15 minutes with me, I am mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, more need it not.</seg>
<seg id="752">Each can bring 15 minutes to the piece, even on a bad Laune-day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes on the piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no laundry, no exhaust.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are ready.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my wellbeing, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is to feel the sums to have a place for his soul friday.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not to play with your own children. it is about pleasure,</seg>
<seg id="759">To play the "Games" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Get the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out it and keep it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I fail and win. friends meet, books read the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"" "" "" "do you want to play?" "" "it is short for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training when I wanted to surpass more and more." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the piece, why not full 15 minutes walk?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my leisure time. the sums seems to return, if I do not work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Works not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door openeth, and I find me again in my office. I listened to new ideas. I listened to new ideas. I use my way again. I use it in full trains and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the sums, the sums isn't I... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Bubble blasts and sticky finger, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sums.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sums of work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so thankable.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is me to me that I am a titanium. I have never seen one Titan, who plays a trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet, I still have everything in the handle. my brain is still working. my bonfires are still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more feel I feel good.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the clearer my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums. the land that I run, the marathon, which I run, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the right sums: the sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this sums, the more makes this unusual, peaceful, naked and new life feeling in me wide. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel like this sums, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am author. I think of things I think you know about life.</seg>
<seg id="789">This belongs to the job, which means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of this jobs,</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"" "I said" "" "for less work and more games." ""</seg>
<seg id="793">Titanen have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you nice.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedy every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a severe stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeon is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is the reason why I functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgery?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nervous functions through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">Certainly they have heard of one of the best known, the "deep-catchstimulation." we implanted a electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurologic function improves.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson, who suffered severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">However, Neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">We moved to this dream by my opinion.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The history began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was a senior leader and worked day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often encountered patients with skull-trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They must imagine that at the skull-miln-traumata the brain goose to the brain and the cranial pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, you have to reduce the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">At this moment, one must sometimes remove a portion of a portion of deer mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse ourselves with Jean François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is no easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Cells of a tissue increase is comparable with all small children who are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, moisture and the environments to thrive them.</seg>
<seg id="823">Exactly this we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts he managed to Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">This he saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a family-cell culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you know from the Biological lessons that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform itself into each cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in OP.</seg>
<seg id="832">We did a further fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They divided slowly and after a few weeks, they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like the stem cells, but kept different.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand from whence they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">This blue and red cells are called the Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our grancerebrinda cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In stage of the Fötus, they provide the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they receive us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, since we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injury.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">However, a matter is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass in the non-speaking area and then remove the cells exactly as cultured as it did Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark colourless to watch them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we implanted them at the opening of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we reimplanted these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we reimplanted the same cells in the wrong brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we planted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that she had been taken after some weeks, when they were already taken back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed there, so disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we met a violation of and reimplanted the same cells and now the cells were up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The proof to show them are these little points. these are the cells that we were in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">We could not stop, of course.</seg>
<seg id="864">Will these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain infringement?</seg>
<seg id="865">So, we trained Monkeys with a manual page.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take animal pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable level of skillity level, we last in the motor home Cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Thus the monkeys were paralyzed, they could not move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen to humans, they recovered spontaneously up to a certain degree, exactly like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then try to recover the plastic braid mechanisms. they recover at a certain degree, just like the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left-hand side you can see the monkeys so spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It may bring about 40% to 50% of its initial performance in front of injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now, when we implanted the cells, the same monkey, two months after mimplantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we found out much more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example Parkinson's Parkinson's.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implanted in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I hope really that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think: "I know anyone who need it."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely fall.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials in humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the greatest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, one needs to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: that is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it needs a long time, a lot of patience and a nearly professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start of clinical trials. if you're looking forward to the future, how many years it takes to get to the hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It already needs a long time to select the patient to perform treatments and evaluate it whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that, you have to apply this to a multi-centric study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You have to think first at first, that it is useful before you can offer to each treatment.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you are told us of it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">In the west, we make a big bug to consider them as of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant which is in reality, but as inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unchangeable encoder.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing have desperate that it is possible to have a blooming capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy around us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I chose Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was undisputed to me as the Minister of Finance in the Eurogroup -- that the democratic process of our country -- do not affect the austerity, which were implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my rising friends that would repeat for me when they would change democracy.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to present an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I pray you, together with me to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistake we could save the democracy, but that we need a true and defective democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">Because without democracy, our companies are mapped, our future dark and our great, new technologies.</seg>
<seg id="914">I would like to refer to an interesting contradiction which currently threatening our business operations.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin Summit Paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the Schoolberg, who throws its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all know the school of school,</seg>
<seg id="918">But only few are aware of its dymus dymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which belongs to anxious savings and corporations, however, it could be productive and income, where it might produce productive-income and also all those things could produce that humanity are urgently needed, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months were invested in the United States, in England and in the Eurozone, in all the wealth produced goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, streets, tracks, equipment, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">After a lot of money, it sounds a lot of money until one compares with the 5,1 trillion U.S. dollars that remained at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing else, except for the stock exchange and real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">So, debts and unproductive capital make twins that are not equal to the usual market mechanisms by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54 year old in the USA, Japan and Europe, and therefore a low overall economic demand that could not invest in which they could not invest. just like Ödipus Father, who could not kill him that his son would kill him if he is growing,</seg>
<seg id="925">Inrolled the circumstances that lead to it that Ödipus kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my Hades with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">All of the unproductive capital should be deployed to improve our life, developing human talents, and especially to finance the technologies, "green" technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is it a solution for democracy?</seg>
<seg id="929">But I think before we proceed: what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as a social form, in which the open and the poor as a majority of the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">Of course the athenical democracy closed too many of --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be an error to reduce the importance of athetic democracy in due to these inclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decision on the athenical democracy was and is that they gave the working arms, and not only the right to free expression of opinion, but important and crucial, which they set the right to political mitigation against questions of state.</seg>
<seg id="935">The athenical democracy did not have a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that illuminates very bright, it is also fast above.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our current democracies did not have their roots in the ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the athenical democracy focused on the free citizens, our liberal democracy based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for ruling powers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy came only on, when a full separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was applied to politics during the economy -- thus the world of the corporations -- a democlical free zone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="941">At the time of today's Democrats since the time when the separation of politics and economy began, an uninherited fight between the two instead of the economy and the economy gradually migrated to politics.</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why the politicians are no longer like this?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is about that one can be nowadays in the government today and still not in power because the power of politics came into the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I chose my Hades with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is in about like a herd of smokers, that is so sustainable the animals that nourishes itself, decimated that they are hungry at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is with the economy, which increases politics as far as well. the power of the corporations grow, political goods are relieved, the economic demand falls and the general manager of the corporations are declining and the managing director of the corporations are to be avoided, the cash of its company is to invest.</seg>
<seg id="948">Ever, the demos of capitalism, the "demos" [the people] out of democracy, the higher will be the twin summit, and so much bigger the disappearance of human labor and prosperity of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If this is true, it is obvious that we must bring the policy and the economy again, and it would be better when the "demos" control is the control of the servants, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it wasn't ondered good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the Debakel of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms can only recover a position like in ancient Athens, without creating new species of brood and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: create the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism do it by replacing low-wage employed by automation and robot.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, so long economy and politics are separate areas, the automation will be higher, and the social conflicts can be higher, as it is already very soon as I think -- in countries such as China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we need to unite the economy and the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we democratically philize the uncompatible field, otherwise we will show the film "Matrix" as a documentation.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is not whether capitalism is the technical achievements which he has created, survive --</seg>
<seg id="958">The most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a Dystopia similar to "Matrix", which will be replaced by the society in "Star Trek" in the machines, or put their energy into the research of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athener "Agora," in long discussions the sense of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it like to look like this "Star Trek" -like utopia rather than the "Matrix" -like Dysteine?</seg>
<seg id="961">In the practical implementation, I would like to tell you some examples of some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of companies: please make a capital market in which you earned money while you are working and in which your capital will follow you from a company to the next, and the company -- whether you are just working -- is property of those who currently work in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and redemption, and the concept of wage work is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No differentiation between those whom the companies belong to work, but employees who do not hear there, but no dipping more between capital and work, no major gaps between investment and spades, and ultimately no possible twins.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the area of global political economy: please make sure that our national currencies have had a free fluctuating exchange rate in a universal, global, digital currency, which will be issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging economies].</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency, we call them "the cosmos," in units of "Cosmos" '-- and every government pays the sum that complies with the trade deficit or trade in the respective country.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund has invested in "green" technologies, particularly in parts of the world, in which investment funds are rar.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have it, especially in front of the background of a united policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world, which I described you is simultaneously liberalized, in which they preferred privileged individuals and marxically, because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the trashcan of history, and keynesian, globally keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Are we awakening in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or are we to sink in a "Matrix" - similar Dysteine?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide to choose politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It's in our hands, and we do it better.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You submit yourself in your biography yourself as liberal Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I have said just said, Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for reunification of politics and economy... do we do that, the technological development will generate a massive decline in overall economic demand, which Larry Summers referred to as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By the transfer of this crisis of one part of the earth to the next, as we currently experience it, it will not only be able to destabilise our Democrats, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Likewise, as Hayek, so I am an liberality of Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am perfect.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: indeed, and now we are doing it.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't make it, you think not enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who said this. BG: in your lecture, you said Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the Redner you have very clear what you think from the point of view of the West in China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a large size of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracy we have received the certificate of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my speech, we have limited democracy on policy, while the area where most of the economy plays, -- the area of the economy -- a fully democlical free zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In some respects, if I may say that so provocative words, China resembles the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to connect to liberalism with democracy -- that's an error, historically regarded.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberal, as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was especially skeptical, affecting the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What one can see now in China, resembles very similar development which we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China now to do that what the West has done itself in the 19th century, smells great after hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners were curious about your experiences as the Minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I noticed that this comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back on the first half of months later?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, out of personal visibility, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "namely, of the" "" "to adopt the eurozone," "" "to adopt a massive failure line through the Eurozone, and continues to tackle the development of the whole European Union." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity to reveal the first suggestion -- the first proposal to reveal this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">Unfortunately it is right to do. unfortunately, the powers have chosen within the euro zone, continue to denying the denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries to receive an economic system, which is not overliable to obtain through political will and authority of militarism, you may have a while without delay, but if the change occurs, it happens abruptly and destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future, if we do not change their structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you have any fault in your time as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back - seriousness...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a Minister of Finance, or any minister, who, after 6 months in office, especially in a so-called situation, claims that he did not make mistakes, then it is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I did mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the training program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was a honest interest on pages of the Money which gave a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They wanted to bring only our government, only because they didn't want to deal with the publishers who ran through the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to stand out that they had a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">It is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">None of the Troika of the Money which gave us this policy, and a: "it was a Colombian mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all the, and despite the aggressive tone of talks, you don't seem to be quite European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone compared to someone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the Eurozone did not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if they do not survive, the redundant tile forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the most powerful economy of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we propose to strike the way of a post-modern 1930, then it will be also available for the future of Europeans as well as the non-European.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you're lying wrong with this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you very much that you were at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">By Roy Price, most still heard, although he is responsible for 22-10 minutes of your life on 19 April 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision to hit the Roy three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a leader employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, streamlined, has an icon and describes on Twitter as "movies, TV, technology, Tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for producing the shows and content that will produce the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard fought branch.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV series that Roy is not able to choose.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows that are very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are all right on this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation division of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB's website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are preserved.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is rated with nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows such as "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that have seen a season, your brain asks: "where are there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This type of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows shows such as "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- that should tell you what about this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not worry about the left side of the curve because I think you already need special intelligence to teach "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts on the middle suspension, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they are not inspiring.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So, he must ensure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present and of course it is the first time that Amazon is so something that Amazon makes nothing risky.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needed guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses through a evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and will make them online wherever they can watch free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon exists for nothing, you get right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of visitors are viewing this episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team to record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture, when you start the show when you pauated, which parts it jumps, or check again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data to decide on these data they should produce them.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process these and from this is the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a SitCom for the republican US-Senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many to remember this show because it was not so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's only an average show -- at the true sense of the word -- because the average of these curve 7.4 is 7.4 and Alpha House endangered at 7.5 -- so somewhat above the average, but not just what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About at the same time for another company, another manager has chosen a top-show by data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the Manager for program design of Netflix. exactly how Roy is always looking for finding this a super-show and it also uses data for it, but he makes it something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of a competition, he and his team had the existing data about the Netflix audience, so the reviews that they give the shows, their course, which shows it like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use these data to find out this small details about the audience: what shows it like producer, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had together all the parts, they went a wagon, and decided to make a sitCom about four Senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 rating on this curve. so exactly there where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">It has two very competent, data experienced companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They combine these many data and it works great for one of them but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because the logic states that all should work in all.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If one collects millions of data, for a decision that will be met, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">One has 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by a very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing that you can expect is good television, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis doesn't work, then this is something special, because we live in a time, in which we are more and more to statistics to meet serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes in contact with this software. come in contact, you are in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If anyone asks here in the US and in order to retrieve it, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release is made or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad will be decided if a person is good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Middle television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but still more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that these data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results. that's not what a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data of the dates are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google does not make mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009 Google announced that it is possible through data analysis of influenza, the worst way to predict -- through data analysis of the Google search.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news release. the success met in a publication in the journal Nature. "</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year around year, until it suddenly didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation in the journal Nature. "</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of the most experienced firms such as Amazon and Google will sometimes understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data is decreasing in decisions of life a -- at the workplace, in the law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">Also I know many difficulties with data. I work in the computer-based genetics -- an area where some very smart people are unimaginable many data to meet serious decisions as decision for a cancer treatment</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I detected some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be widespread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">Do you have to solve one complex problem, do not do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, write this problem in its single parts, so that you can analyze the individual parts; as second, use the single parts again to receive a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and put together.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help solve one problem and understand his parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all have all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something when the brain is good, it is parts and pieces again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to hold a good decision -- especially if the brain is an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and understanding, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to understand their audience, for what else could it be unable. but the decision, how to put all these parts again, and it makes a show how "House of Cards" makes it not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they entered a large personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, however, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first as they contest TV ideas, then choose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a secure decision because they always say: "they say the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful to better decisions but I think that things wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are only one tool, and around that not to forget is this device pretty useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before it was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no-question, you only need to shake the ball to get an answer. "highly likely" -- exactly here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will start it later with a technique demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">I have previously made some decisions in my life, whereby I should hear the ball in the afterward.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But how you're sure to know if you have the data available, you would like to replace these through something much, as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic construction.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So perhaps the ball clüger and klüger. ultimately it lies on us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right curve.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I am more sensitive to meet this than encouraging message that despite the great amount of data still pays out to make decisions as an expert in what you do, and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because at the end, it is not the data, but the risks, with which you landing at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you nice.</seg>
