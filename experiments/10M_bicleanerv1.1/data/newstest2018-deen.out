Munich 1856 : four cards that change your sight to the city
an er@@ r @-@ An@@ st@@ alt , where young people are to meet .
a Gru@@ ft@@ chapel , where is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers generate the lon@@ ely cause of pe@@ as@@ ants .
the oldest official map Mün@@ ch promotes exciting stories about days .
it nerv@@ es if land cards are not currently able .
this knows everyone who had to move to a green meadow because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i was on a green meadow .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ l@@ ases , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bayern of the State government , are all other than currently - yet is now very reve@@ aling .
especially if you compare it with current online @-@ cards .
then it is clear how towns and communities in the area of the Munich Mercury has changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria Atlas is a flip @-@ carpet , which one can not recognize as such .
in the great overview map for cities and municipalities , more detailed maps , called Ur@@ path@@ onic leaves , were incorporated into the big picture card .
this originated according to the Bavarian survey@@ ing administration between 1810 and 1864 , and from the first survey@@ ing of Bavaria .
your principal : Napoleon .
the French army occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 , during the Second World War .
Napoleon wanted a survey of the occupied country and was commissioned by a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria - of course to military purposes .
even if French troops mar@@ ched with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from February 9 , 1801 : there were the neigh@@ bors who created the idea of an extensive Bavaria map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph drove the project further , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thereby the Bavarian survey@@ ing administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the charter sheet for Munich originates from the year 1856 and can be found as all others at the Bavarian Authority &apos;s website .
the comparison of early days / Today is the most impressive capital for the most impressive .
the city has grown to all directions and has grown rapidly .
one example is sub@@ missions that is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .
S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map , in 1877 , in the district of Munich .
today Sub@@ scription is in the middle of the city .
the houses can be concentrated around 1856 along the today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ erst@@ raße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , you can see nothing as fields - at the first glance : when in the zo@@ oming , a small part numbers with dozens of lines and numbers : hand @-@ numbered Fl@@ ur@@ ks from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ um@@ ption , &quot; which was derived from which the property tax was derived .
small plots have no more farmers there today - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green space distingu@@ ishes itself north of sub @-@ send@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 1810 , became a meadow of the Oktober@@ fest@@ ation in the 19th century , there was a meadow and a concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historic map shows a insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the district court , the au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen district is not just reading the street name &quot; at the fan , &quot; or from the altitude &quot; on the fan , &quot; but also in large letters &quot; mistaken An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ field Road they were once un@@ locked people with mad@@ ness .
in 1858 / 59 the Munich Circle @-@ Ir@@ ene Institute began in the exhibition &quot; Au@@ er fans . &quot;
from 1872 Dr. Bernhard had led the establishment of the institution - that psychiat@@ rist who was brought to death by King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the w@@ ells of the so @-@ called . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he says the staff , violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ alt .
first place for 280 patients was first place , later on 500 places was expanded .
sometime , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for construction of the Kreis@@ ir@@ ren@@ unci@@ ation Camp in 1905 .
there have been the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost since 2006 , one of the largest psychiat@@ rist@@ s in Germany .
on the occasion of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt , young people meet in Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and took him in a youth shelter with training course .
located west is the football pitch of the TS@@ V Munich east , east of residential homes from the 1980s .
in 2015 , we established the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; - in architectural re@@ jection to the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , who had been destroyed during WW@@ II in bombing raid over the Second World War .
the Marien@@ platz was listed in 1856 as the main square , &quot; Kauf@@ ing@@ erst@@ raße named &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley . &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War even in the heart of Mün@@ ker .
the bombs of the Al@@ lies broke many holes in the city center in December 1944 .
a big remained until today - on Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institut , small business houses and a Gru@@ ft@@ chapel from the Middle Ages were once on Mari@@ enhof , where this day will take place and on 5 April 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony will take place for the second S @-@ Bahn station .
with the sli@@ der , the old Munich @-@ card can be filled with the aerial picture of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
Civil Rights Group publishes Travel@@ ers for Missouri
the National Association for Promot@@ ing Color has issued a warning for colored people due to discri@@ min@@ ating politics and rac@@ ist attacks by the State of Missouri .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri , which might enter into force on August 28 , 2017 , demands special attention and mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans , since a series of frag@@ ile , road @-@ based inci@@ dents in the entire state and here are noted , &quot; it is stated in the statement of the group .
a recent law of Missouri that makes people heavier to win a discrimination of discrimination , as well as the prosecution agencies of the state having disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate to min@@ orities , the group recorded the travel agent , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; they have violations of the citizens of citizens .
they will be ro@@ uted because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of the Missouri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .
&quot; we hear complaints in an incidence that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot;
it is the first warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA .
the group quoted inci@@ dents such as rac@@ ist attacks against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
S@@ anders died under frag@@ ile circumstances in the beginning of the year , after he had no petrol during the journey through the State of Missouri , and by the police of Missouri were accused of a crime .
the Council also refers to a recent report by the Office of the Office of Missouri , in which black drivers will be more common in the state 75 percent more common .
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of men and their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri , &quot; said Chapel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people have to be willing to bring out the money , or know the relatives that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 , Missouri was able to break in Hass@@ elt , after the latest numbers from Hass@@ elt &apos;s report program of the FB@@ I , which capit@@ alize the state with regard to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country .
the travel arm@@ ament is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would be difficult to acc@@ use a company because of living or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued a trip for Texas and Arizona , after the states of immig@@ ration authorities under@@ take to understand people because of immig@@ rant attacks , which will contribute to the AC@@ L@@ U to further expansion of the AC@@ L@@ U .
trav@@ ellers are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , but at the last time , stak@@ eholders have used the action as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the USA .
electric fence project is Elem@@ ental
the Fisch@@ erb@@ ach Weimar project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CDU Bundestag with the CDU Bundestag and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have set itself a picture on the spot .
at the legal venue of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , the representative of the CDU @-@ area of the CDU @-@ area were met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann granted first in@@ sights into his company , where he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest cultivated , 40 milk cows , and as many young men supplies and houses in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative relief road for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of the Feri@@ h@@ edge of the Feri@@ h@@ edge there is exclusively regional .
since it is also BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach , he called the electric fence as &quot; Elem@@ ental project . &quot;
I cannot be profitable for such steep surfaces .
the green land care for a lot of work , much to be processed with the engine sense .
&quot; we have been here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; stressed by Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
in 2003 he took over the el@@ ter@@ nal operation and acquired this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he lead no bio@@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the commune has recognized the meaning of the electric fence project and is happy about the leader funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at costs of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare , farmers should be supported .
we hope that the collection of surfaces could be pulled out for a period of time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have , are the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts on how they continue to bring their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often stated because of the funding often in criticism
in 2013 a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
the surface area is thus 40 hectares , which must not be stopped until at least 2023 .
of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half of the leader was promoted , a quarter contributed the congregation of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach .
therefore , the farmers stayed 12 610 euros that they had to invest in 16@@ .2 kilometers of electric fence .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you do not make a good job , without farmers and landing . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter White , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here the best foods are produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the State Territ@@ ories ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state support of women f@@ ences .
the goal is to maintain the Black Forest .
the presence of one of the L@@ PR has provided funding .
in addition , the in@@ oc@@ ative area should not be harmful ( hang@@ ar to 35 per cent ) and must be threatened by the order .
for the 2018 Fisch@@ erb@@ ated Weimar project , eight participants currently runs with 24 plots , which would like to build nearly 16 kilometres of fence .
the open surface area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is to attack when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans estimate these same as any other - therefore the sor@@ row@@ ful fall of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos place in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , knew what he did when he took a symbolic number in a heat battle with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N on the proposals of the president to dra@@ stic limitation with the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller didn &apos;t handle the statue itself .
a Hor@@ de of Bo@@ dies and Liberty Im@@ it@@ ators had a g@@ yn@@ thesis if he had done it .
but he attacked their significance , and in particular the importance that it was attributed to Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , its base was added .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta testified , &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a full thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom which light@@ eth the world .
the po@@ em , which you should refer to which later was added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is true , but as he formulated it itself , it is not really about history .
it is concerned about the contemporary reson@@ ance on the rising words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state does not only charge any old immig@@ rants , but the p@@ oo@@ rest of the poor : &quot; to the poor , thy poor , and thy afflic@@ tions that go free to bre@@ athe out , and destroy the waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; el@@ ende &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller committed themselves in literary criticism - he clearly made that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict due to the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural conflict : it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends , who want to place their words after her death on the basis - knew very good that they all completed a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ ans , showing the female bon@@ ding of the freedom in a un@@ used classical representation of the freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her po@@ em is the female figure no more abstract - she has received a voice .
and there is a very different name : mother of Ex@@ il@@ ant .
the connection of the po@@ em with the picture is a brilliant femin@@ ist cou@@ p and a devastating attack on the American Nati@@ vity .
and just as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue , the people wanted to change the people from the right wing .
the great cry of the Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed 2010 , that the Statue of Liberty cannot call , but rather an early neo @-@ conservative , which will bring the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty goes forward .
it should carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch shall not shine the way into the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh left here on something .
the meaning of the statue is quite and even a question of the point of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus also existed in it to see how they had seen from the exhau@@ sted , but hop@@ eful people after long and often horri@@ ble trips on the deck of ships was seen .
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from perspective of people who seek refuge and improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome that they must listen .
and that &apos;s not the perspective , the Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever want to recogn@@ ise .
their tor@@ ch shall not shine forth the way , but the hat@@ red , the only source of power is ign@@ ited .
world championship 2017 : Neil Black , Scottish Members of the Great Britain
Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle reminds one of time when only two sc@@ orn belonged to the Team of Great Britain
the power director of the Athlet@@ ics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent has a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 on Friday .
black believes that &quot; in Scotland has developed something special , &quot; and the athlet@@ ics of the United Kingdom has to learn something from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we will continue to find it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I talk with people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done .
British Athlet@@ ics : it has something with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever is the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals of medals , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ ler - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m route , while Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle was elected to the team &apos;s team .
&quot; Eil@@ id@@ h is quite modest .
their capit@@ als was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a series of athletes , no matter whether they were Scottish or practice , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motiv@@ ated .
the passion and true feeling that the Eil@@ id@@ h was very natural , was great . &quot;
the Commonwealth silver med@@ alli@@ sts who will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 @-@ m Hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; unbeliev@@ ably &quot; that 16 barri@@ ers are in the British team .
Scotland has been the best total of athletes at the World@@ championship in 1983 , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle runner Mu@@ ir is on this path and has set up five British and two European records last year .
it will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m races .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , which runs 1.500 m , is another Scot@@ s@@ man running after a great season that was included in the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle commemor@@ ates their first World Championships , when the only other Scot@@ s@@ man was in the team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
the man@@ tle capit@@ als says that they are &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; on the fact that many of their coun@@ try@@ men are not only belong to the team , but in some cases also with medals and the final .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the special about team capit@@ als lies that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that there was something great honour for me , but to know that my team mates voted for me and chose me something very special for me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; obviously I am very proud of all the vill@@ i that belong to the team .
it just shows how far we came .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to rise in Po@@ dien .
what my speech related to Chap@@ ter@@ in ?
yes , I think it went well .
I have only noted that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home World Championship .
so it &apos;s really important to put on these hom@@ ew@@ ays and benefit from it that we are back in the Olympic stadium .
I get a second chance to go out there and compete , and it &apos;s just like a great atmosphere there outside . &quot;
block from critics on Facebook : do not worry about a public position if you cannot bear the heat of voters .
the father of our country knew some worse press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it took not long until the newspapers beat him because of the inner policy until his political principles .
he rebu@@ ked on the cr@@ iti@@ que , safely .
but he did not put his critics to silence .
in 1783 Washington , Washington , said : &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stup@@ id and dum@@ b we will lead like the sheep for the battles . &quot;
this brings me to Maryland to Govern@@ or Larry H@@ og@@ an who needs to work more than Washington .
H@@ og@@ ans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and sold their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union pro@@ ver@@ ts him therefore at the beginning of this week .
the staff of the govern@@ ors dismissed the law@@ suit as fri@@ vol@@ an , and the online comment was full of a counter reaction with &quot; Na , and ? &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s only Facebook , &quot; they said many people .
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it &apos;s a type such as H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can Govern@@ or in an overwhelming democratic state that is aston@@ ishing .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors &apos; govern@@ ors .
H@@ og@@ an is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary heat head .
he has shown a fixed hand with the leadership of its state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
he was also well sent to use Facebook as a primary resources to connect to his elec@@ tors and play his hair@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the blocking of people who come to the site of the govern@@ ors - which is a public forum , which is officially designated as officially and by employees who are paid by public tax @-@ Dollar - un@@ necessary and finally dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post def@@ ended H@@ og@@ ans spokes@@ person Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse the actions of the governor and argu@@ ed that the comments of comments was nothing more than a Moder@@ ation .
but it is too simple to use the image of trol@@ ytes or water @-@ filled people who force the lines online .
the post spoke with some of the real people that were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are only true people who speak with their chosen leaders , a teacher , a business@@ man and a priest , no Tro@@ l@@ le .
they all said that their comments were resp@@ ectable , non @-@ violent and non @-@ prof@@ ane .
the past@@ or cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to H@@ og@@ ans of the Catholic faith .
attor@@ ney at Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , wasn &apos;t h@@ ass@@ filled , but she questi@@ oned to Hass@@ le .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to Hass@@ elt and other recent news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary area &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t count this idea if a number of people takes place on the same theme , then they are mis@@ used by some more than a so @-@ called collections and not as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what the staff of the govern@@ ors as a &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; would call others &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession . &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut out a message by simply deleted a critic or a negative comment .
it is a lot of cleaner than in previous days when you have done the same people that staff have been sent to collect newspapers and to burn and burn newspapers , and to burn , or to remove activists .
but exactly this happened to digitally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public officials , which is critic@@ ized that he has imp@@ lied on Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is compl@@ ained by Twitter users suffering from his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell in Virginia .
the Chair@@ woman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County last the first am@@ assing , according to U.S. District Judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , named a voters from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , governor Matt Before ( R ) received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U due to his use of Facebook and Twitter .
that should not be so hard .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable portrait had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers toler@@ ated themselves between 1776 and 1800 ; and anonymous Letter of letters struck on his lead .
and at that time Washington had anonymous Tro@@ l@@ le .
the people , the pseud@@ onym@@ s such as &quot; Law@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; called &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; and &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers , which made Washington &apos;s decisions .
Pet@@ itions , who critic@@ ised its position over the contract of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with the United Kingdom of critic@@ ized his ministry , according to the historical documents , collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project .
but he did not put them to silence .
speech : freedom of expression and dis@@ courses are the foundation of our nation .
and true leadership means to accept that .

this event will be the first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s always a bit more when you play at home &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said OR@@ R , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you want to do it , but you feel like this additional pressure .
I really enjoyed it again , and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

all revenues go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer due to passive smoke
in the past two decades , less people are dead because of passi@@ v@@ rau@@ se of lung cancer .
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this result in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 pneum@@ onia falls on Passi@@ v@@ smoke per year &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Di@@ ko Becher &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in comparison , he moved his own study on this topic of 1994 .
at that time there have been 400 lung cancer cases for passive smo@@ ker a year .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections are considered very complex
the construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; are reas@@ onably priced at the time , &quot; the director of the &quot; Fred Hein@@ ze &quot; station .
in the area of the house connections , the location is more complicated as suspected , since there is a lot of mountains , which is not indicated in the plans .
the traffic , which is always ob@@ stru@@ cted the construction work , represents a big problem for the construction sector of St@@ ump@@ p .

in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai rain@@ bow in the un@@ quiet Indonesian province Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually specifies a sweet potato - local as &quot; Not@@ a &quot; - directly in the chim@@ ney .

Poly@@ gam@@ ie is common here .
of course late , too works can be dangerous : most vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there is here the soldiers .
&quot; nobody said that after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; says she .
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversi@@ al referendum in Indonesia , when only 1.0@@ 26 elders were able to vote by a public h@@ end@@ point before the occupying troops .
an existing movement that came up for independence against the Dutch rule , turning quickly against the government of Jakarta , which operates control of the region , maintains foreign journalists or legal observation activities .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is so ab@@ oun@@ ded as it is desert . the trip contains a 90 minute flight from the province of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there is no public transport .
the city with approximately 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , surrounded by bam@@ bo@@ o fenced , and made of corrugated ro@@ ofs that were converted by rust in different gel@@ b@@ brown tones .
only very few gu@@ ards have taken their journey here , soft because journalists and practically no fore@@ igner .

there were other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to bear these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and suggests to their lively , hand woven tur@@ ban , its dark shirts and their bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had just had leaves to our body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua is in@@ don@@ esi@@ ens in the province where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but there is also In@@ don@@ esi@@ ens Gold@@ land .
the largest and profitable gold mine of the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is only 60 miles away from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a provincial provincial city in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3.000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has dismant@@ led the value of 3.1 billion US dollars gold and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua disposes of wood resources valued at estimated 78 billion US dollars .
however , these riches are a source of mis@@ ery for the Pap@@ ua , the saf@@ est that In@@ don@@ esi@@ ens will preserve an initial presence .
a study of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 paid almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ an claims based on major autonomy thre@@ aten these golden genes and are treated gn@@ ashing .
according to activists , more than 500,000 pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped by the Indonesian military , tor@@ tured and imprisoned since 1969 .
mass@@ acres in Pap@@ u@@ as St@@ es@@ hi@@ des in the 1970 @-@ 2000 years were sentenced to genocide in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission for genocide .
in the region alone , Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 species demonstr@@ ators in the past year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re talking about everything in a report of the arch@@ di@@ o@@ ese Brisbane from 2016 , in the reports about atro@@ cities and torture - rape and electro@@ c@@ als are especially popular according to another report - and the brutal precip@@ itation of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , as every week happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have strengthened , since Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring a state of settlements from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but the demo@@ graphic development changed , since Muslim economic migrants have changed from the colonies rich Islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra , and Sul@@ aw@@ esi .

the Indonesian President J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , also known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , said during his election campaign in 2014 , the ine@@ qualities and the infr@@ in@@ gement in Pap@@ ua .
the former Zimmermann , 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the Presi@@ dential Palace in Jakarta .
but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the nati@@ ves feel betrayed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the expect@@ ation that he will fulfill our hopes that the righteousness is restored , &quot; says You &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is opening in October .
on 7 December 2014 , there was a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a bon@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke out on a motorbike by the darkness .
the rock@@ ed children told them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took a stum@@ bling of her tone , and later returned with four soldiers , the local past@@ or Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , pursued and struck the group with their def@@ endants , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired in the group of children .
one child , who was 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ end@@ o , was so difficult that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set to fire and the things es@@ cal@@ ated on the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered themselves on a football pitch before the local police station and the Military Commander centre to ask justice .
they carried out cr@@ em@@ oni@@ al Jag@@ db@@ ö@@ gen and led the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance in a circle and a bird @-@ sung - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ Stamm .
some demonstr@@ ators began to drag stones to police and military posts .
when the atmosphere was heated , the soldiers sent an order on an internal radio : &quot; if the masses aff@@ ord more than three times , they shoot her dead , called it in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not released to local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ four@@ t@@ els of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the dro@@ h@@ end risk and called to rest and called to return home .
no one was able to listen to the mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned back to my left hand , I suddenly appeared in my left hand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his colorful wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
k@@ ay@@ ame knows not yet who has fired , but says that the ball out of the rows gathered here together .
&quot; it was crow@@ ded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was taken three times , his c@@ ousin , who was the witness of the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I met him , and sought his body to make sure that he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who carries a name , the TI@@ ME is a dark mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I have kissed him . &quot;
the editor of the Pap@@ ua @-@ Police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , said repor@@ ters that his officers wanted to receive their station only &quot; and wanted to attack them .
&quot; we must defend ourselves if people are threatened to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua Police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 .
&quot; it goes around life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more injured .
the news about the k@@ ill@@ ings came only on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jakarta .
in the three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i stayed a passionate speech in which he made sympath@@ ies for families of the victims , and s@@ ware to tackle the historical mis@@ er@@ ships in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want that this case is immediately solved , so that it will not happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that it infr@@ ing@@ es an extra@@ judicial mechanism to the side of historical human rights violations .
but the talking started almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries have occurred long ago .
some were in the 90 @-@ s and the beginning of the 2000 years .
the point is that we have committed us to walk these clubs , but there are processes that will pass through , &quot; he said .
then Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke in Jakarta on 5 June in Jakarta with TI@@ ME and said he had no plans to establish a complaint in Pap@@ ua .
instead , &quot; everything is regulated , &quot; he said .
Wir@@ anto , accused the UN for crimes against humanity , called for more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or bloody independence of 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Pap@@ ua has already been buried in Pap@@ ua .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims were contrary to such claims with fierce beli@@ ever .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes .
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear .
&quot; I have fear , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was defeated by the military , after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the slides did not hear .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police ra@@ ced on the vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a con@@ front@@ ation between vill@@ agers and the managers of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring a awareness man to the hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , who was d@@ row@@ ned 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drunk in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
Kur@@ ds vill@@ agers protest@@ ed before the firm &apos;s site .
the police said that the vill@@ agers had cast stones for officers who responded to them by taking warning signs .
but loc@@ als say that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killing them .
&quot; we were so in pan@@ ic , we have fear that it is reven@@ ge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i , who has been living in the vicinity of the hospital and was witness as the last here is the TI@@ ME .
&quot; I have hidden two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called to withdraw the officers to withdraw from the territory , and to withdraw the mobile Brigade of the police out of the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a monster for Indonesian government .
the lack of sen@@ su@@ al development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many included the &quot; Free Par@@ ua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel Army , which claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by taking a spor@@ adic attacks and kidn@@ apping of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Y@@ og@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ oya .
in response to the last few years thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai and was arbitr@@ arily arrested in custody , under the pre@@ text of the &quot; securing of the national sover@@ eig@@ n@@ ty . &quot;
some dive never again .
among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the bit rice is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is expensive for loc@@ als .
bread is the same except range .
the people here are all that they eat : in particular , emergency and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the role of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potato .
they reserve most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of emergency cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 cents ) .
during the time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants who have arrived to Nab@@ ire in bigger number since the opening of new flight routes .
the few jobs that exist in the region are normally trained to the better trained and we@@ al@@ thy migrants .
Pap@@ ua has rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to perform their own company competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in to stay in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
insulation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restrictions to the reporting of international media are e@@ ager .
at the beginning of the year , French journalist Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported to lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , even though the rare permission was given to films .
according to Ph@@ el@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is campaign , were unable to increase the limitations of reporting to promote transparency and development , not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new d@@ angers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ peaceful oasis of pap@@ ua and Western pap@@ ua : visa ref@@ usal and a black list &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in a declaration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press monitoring means that the international pressure is largely limited to the Indonesian government &apos;s immediate neighbours .
in March , six Pacific states - Tong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ ine and Solomon &apos;s islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; different and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting gallery .
the same countries have been historically supported by the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha Nas@@ ir proved the pursu@@ es of the group and said journalists in Jakarta : &quot; in Indonesia it is still a democratic system , and there is free media , so that it is difficult to refuse the evidence of human rights cases . &quot;
people want to know that more foreign governments take advantage of it .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human rights ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura visited her silence and op@@ ted him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that participated in the meeting , but also anonymous .
Indonesia has a further presidential election but the Pap@@ ua say that they will probably be able to vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good inten@@ tions , but it is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai River , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Council . &quot;
he wants to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people don &apos;t know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from it , is living under the constant thre@@ ats of a burning military , in poor educ@@ ators and health services .
Gob@@ i says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , have to consider her voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; debt . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they want only righteousness , &quot; says he .
in spite of thre@@ ats and en@@ roll@@ ments , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai sh@@ uss@@ ers led a final symbolic au@@ ght from : the bodies of a sacrifice was buried in an area just opposite the police and military station .
they know that there may never be justice to them , but at least they don &apos;t let them forget their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai to the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai , hundreds of inhabitants , of which 337 meters high , 79 @-@ storey buildings flee .
it is the second fire that takes place in only two years by the high tower that is called acci@@ dental Tower ( tor@@ ch Tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of flame .
&quot; we slept and we have stood by the fire alarm and the cry of the people . &quot;
we crossed the stairs down , and it took about 10 minutes to come from the 50th floor to the bottom , &quot; told a residents that had his name as George Ang@@ ab , Reuters .
Dub@@ ais Civil Protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting at 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building cooled .
the government said they work on the provision of shel@@ ters for the data subject .
incident can be used to ensure safety of materials that are used in outdoor areas of high @-@ houses in the whole world , revi@@ ved .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the biggest part of the damage from the covering , the outer covering to decor@@ ating or insulation .
in the UK , the police , they believe that the system of plates for isolation and clothing at the London Gren@@ elle Tower could have contributed to the spread of a fire which died about 80 people .
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Court ( IT@@ F ) is made with its large Davis Cup cou@@ p at the Annual General Meeting .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , it was only supported for this sport revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single only on two winners , Hau@@ ch@@ thin not supported by the required two @-@ third majority .
although often very long , but also very estimated five @-@ set classi@@ cs remain so far as well as the traditional competition .
6@@ 3,@@ 54 percent of the member states agreed to reform the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , therefore only barely missed out .
&quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our members are not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of this i@@ con@@ ian and historical competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty .
I will continue to work to improve the applications .
not until the vote , after many pro@@ claims , the proposal came out to apply the finale to a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller detail : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be the host right next year in the first round .
in order to reduce the cost of organizers , the requirements for training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and the players will need to complete less official media appoint@@ ments in front of the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US trav@@ ellers brings remaining objects into the plane , finds a survey
a survey conducted by flight inter@@ act indicates that more than 20 percent be aware of or un@@ aware objects regarding the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , which contributed the plane while they acci@@ dentally used knife or other items with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed , they had discovered delayed that they had travelled Iranian with fire@@ arms , am@@ mun@@ ition or explo@@ si@@ ves .
the survey of more than 1,000 people - which was conducted by a Jet @-@ Char@@ ter@@ service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was held - confirmed that younger trav@@ ellers have failed rather the rules .
of those questi@@ oned , the allow@@ ances that they are wis@@ ely tried to fly with something that had been banned by T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , were members of the Generation X .
the most common items that were deliber@@ ately buried on T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent said to have borne items with blade carried out by the safety control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male respon@@ dents confirm that they had been inten@@ tionally related to the aircraft .
the company said that it is inter@@ viewed to find travelers throughout the country to figure out how many acci@@ dentally Schm@@ ug@@ gel@@ ware was brought through the airport security and how many things had done so far .
it is not a surprise that people who are most frequent sm@@ ug@@ ly or ignor@@ ant - through the safety , those that are most frequently fly .
however , the company indicates that the T@@ SA directives are slightly complicated and conf@@ using .
people often are in@@ secure , which can take them away or how much of it .
so it &apos;s not a surprise that the largest amount of articles of the T@@ SA conf@@ is@@ cated objects are prohibited .
for a period the people thinking , the T@@ SA could see books as sm@@ ug@@ ging goods .
liquids are allowed in domestic flights but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : to cancel the tens of thousands of Tesla .
electric @-@ thous@@ and@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k gives the huge number of orders for his new Tesla &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
in the meantime , he has now under@@ cut that a part of the customer has already withdrawn its non @-@ binding reservation again .
in addition to the always triumph@@ al numbers on sales growth and even more huge target targets , Tesla boss El@@ on Mus@@ k voted for the first time a different , less smooth number : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
Mus@@ k , in the past few months , Mus@@ k frequently asked more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose extra@@ dition occurs just .
well , Mus@@ k : from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 orders , 63@@ .000 have already been withdrawn .
critics had always noted that it is only true for the non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation you will pay the 1000 Euro ( 1000 US dollars in the US and in the UK 1000 Po@@ unds ) .
at the moment , 45@@ 5.000 of such a non @-@ binding reservations made in a telephone conference with an@@ alysts .
however , the cancellation of so far more than twelve percent of all orders will not be problem , however , the Tesla boss doesn &apos;t believe .
his argument : the challenge for the ambitious growth target is not in demand , but on the production site .
in the past year Tesla has delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 it is expected to be joined - all models will be - 500,000 to be one million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , there are currently 1800 reservations per day .
who today ordered a &quot; Model 3 &quot; must be delivered at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla it manages to carry out his n@@ ag@@ el@@ new , never in practice , without larger interrup@@ tions with maximum util@@ isation .
many experts doub@@ ts that this is possible .
however , it comes to greater del@@ ays , then the non @-@ binding of reservations may be used for Tesla .
for then , the company has not been able to des@@ per@@ ate the customer in Sch@@ ed@@ d@@ av@@ on@@ aut .
EPA boss P@@ ru@@ itt extends due to the execution of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
one day after having been accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , chief of the Environmental Protection Authority , made his previous decision to refuse the implementation of the Obama era to reduce the smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change , when his agency proved to meet the needs of the state environmental authorities in comparison with re@@ charges .
he mentioned not the law@@ suit , which had been raised against his previous site in a Federal Court of Appeal .
it goes around a deadline which ran on 1 October for states to meet the standards of ozone @-@ floor near ozone .
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he will be delayed by a year to study the plan to study more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local decisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump State At@@ tor@@ ney of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , had long time a reliable opponent over environmental protection regulations .
since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt is repeatedly forced to block or in@@ sof@@ tened to block the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden change of wed@@ n@@ esday is the youngest legal feedback for the period of regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA direct investment has exceeded his authority as he attempted to comm@@ end the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas company for monitoring and reduction of me@@ than@@ le@@ cks .
in a review published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt released that his swe@@ aring in ozone standards just simply the read@@ iness of EPA for cooperation with the states through the complex process of tim@@ ely ful@@ fill@@ ment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous circumstances , the EPA often did not pay the dead@@ lines for performing activists and then waiting for the implementation of activists in an agreement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we do not believe on a regulation of judicial proceedings , and we assume Fri@@ sten .
we also accept the law and authority that gives it to us . &quot;
nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; powers to delay and all other law , &quot; to ensure that the regulations are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
Rep@@ ublic@@ ans can be found in Congress on a more comprehensive re @-@ version of the ozone control .
one in the last month of approval , the implementation of the rules of 2015 must be delayed by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet set up in the Senate .
the New York State At@@ tor@@ ney , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of the states led the EPA in this week , said the group intended to justi@@ fy the legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the return of EPA - according to our cl@@ auses - is an important profit for health and security of these 6.7 million New York who are affected directly from smo@@ g who flows into their municipalities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this case , in this case , California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penns@@ yl@@ van@@ ies , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil @-@ Oz@@ on arises when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants , chemical plants and other sources respond to sunlight .
the resulting Smo@@ g may cause serious respiratory problems , and every year to thousands of premature death cases .
representatives of the public health industry and the environ@@ ment@@ alists joy@@ ously che@@ ered over a few days of the course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is anno@@ ying how much pressure needs to do this sen@@ sible step by the responsible for the protection of the air which we in@@ hal@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight against the ide@@ ological clo@@ ister of the Tr@@ ump government to tackle environmental cont@@ amin@@ ants and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the place have made friends and sponsors of tum@@ ble at their capacity .
Walter Martini emphas@@ ises : &quot; it is a unique Hungarian Klein@@ od . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in the Württemberg State Court : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with which the parish church of Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard from Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the wording of the document , on the Tum@@ linger Berg , apart from the parish church there is also a splendid courtyard , to whom the church or patron was right and not vice vers@@ a .
so there were people there .
as from the description of the Upper Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 1858 , next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which today is currently in the town of Tum@@ ours just to see today , the &quot; mountain &quot; the third , the magnificent sett@@ lers of the village .
old maps from the time around the year 1600 per@@ imeter these historical circumstances .
the patron law originated from the early medieval owner .
one Lord , who built a church , restored and occupied with a priest &apos;s priest , remains the owner of this church , and he could also inherit these y@@ enk@@ ir@@ che .
this was the right to propose a priest or the Bishop of a new priest .
there were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the size of the two pieces on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell was first given for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be released in 1942 in the Second World War .
in the Thir@@ ty Years War ( 16@@ 16 to 1648 ) the windows discs were stolen and the bell valves were stolen .
the roof was un@@ dense .
in 1796 French troops camp@@ ed near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and the church @-@ mill and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened by 1809 .
until 1869 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from list@@ eners .
in 1823 the gra@@ vey@@ ard was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demolished .
only the bell tower was left .
in the New Year in 1834 , a storm collap@@ sed the tower and the half collap@@ sed .
to prevent a disaster , the tower was demolished .
today , only existing tower @-@ wer@@ g remained the witness of the 750 years old church history .

Verein wants to check Win@@ dr@@ ä@@ s from Win@@ dr@@ ä@@ s
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sees no legal pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite for construction and has therefore turned back to the council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim , &quot; Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CDU ) has asked to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ eimer N@@ ette .
it is illegal to be un@@ lawful .
the association argu@@ ed that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ eimer N@@ ette has no wind power plants could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen only has a wind force concentration zone .
within this concentration zone construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , at the same time , the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind turbines for the rest of the city .
such zones are to prevent a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
although the city four had already decided by a change in the surface area in the Bo@@ ish@@ eimer N@@ ette - which had not approved the Düsseldorf District government , because of a form@@ edness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lack of approval certificate is declared as illegal and therefore rep@@ aid , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Bo@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of things : the city council has decided in front of the summer break once again the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ eimer N@@ ette ; a approval of the regional government is still standing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is excluded at this place the issu@@ ance of approval for the erection of wind turbines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circuit confirms the entrance of the collection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has received since last week at the circle Vier@@ sen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes you to the occasion of checking the matter again .
however , they are expected to end that the procedure is stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a look at the ongoing process of the administrative district , the circle on Thursday didn &apos;t want to participate in the reas@@ oning of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ eimer N@@ ette which covers the construction of four each 200 meters high .
the company had already been involved in this year last year , in which the city quadru@@ ple has been involved , lease contracts with the owner of about 65 hectares .
with the erection of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households will be covered - this equ@@ ates to approximately one fifth of the electricity needs of all four households .
the NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros .
in the past summer there was a green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind farm Lin@@ ni@@ ch in Aachen as well as a participation in the wind power plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Hein@@ sberg district .

Tr@@ ump continued the tran@@ scription of telephone calls to Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scription of phone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tr@@ ump asked for a phone with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto , to say publicly that he would not pay for an planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US President rep@@ lied him because he publicly accused the wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump launched its presidential campaign with the promise to establish a wall in the southern border of the United States , and s@@ ware to pay Mexico for the project .
tran@@ scription of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ Bull was also published and enth@@ used an additional exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ Bull said that a trade for the USA refugees forced to take over &quot; ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; stup@@ id &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that the existence of trade , which was convey@@ ed by the Obama administration , he would look like a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Moo@@ res Ford @-@ massacre : activists lead ra@@ cial Lyn@@ ch@@ ase as a call for Justice
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury drove a group of viewers in rural Monroe , Georgia , and run@@ k to the Ford Bridge of Moore .
before the car , the four black passengers and a white rider could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out to block his way .
the leader of the Mo@@ bs - a man middle age in a needle strike - took a long train at his cig@@ ar , looking at the wind@@ shield .
indoor and insert the occup@@ ants in fear .
&quot; we want this n -@@ --- r Roger ! &quot; wre@@ cked the man .
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ ams torn the silence , as a young black man from the passenger seat was distor@@ ted .
fortunately , this awesome scene was played on July 22 , only one night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when a sn@@ ares are thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out almost all of them in the audience very true sig@@ h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 we come back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night , in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Kl@@ ux Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one has been charged because of murder .
&quot; it is really un@@ speak@@ able that in all these years , no one was arrested , although we see them in our municipalities , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks that assi@@ sts in the organization of the reproduction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt spot on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former congress of the state of Georgia and a life for civil war .
for him , the act is used as a dramatic call for hand@@ ing and provides an annual memory to the Monroe community that it was never corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want the prosec@@ utions , we want to refuse , we want to reconciliation , but first we need to receive justice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we cannot get to healing and reconciliation , until we receive justice . &quot;
a court medi@@ c shows a du@@ vet on the bodies of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ne &apos;s victims , July 27 , 1946 .
according to the FB@@ I files that were received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding areas were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but no one was charged ever .
although the susp@@ ects remain on the free foot for decades , Citi@@ zens say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in all the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court accepted the black citizens in Georgia for the first time to complete their vote in the summer campaign .
at the same time as the election st@@ ach according to the FB@@ I of the black Far@@ mp@@ ter Roger Mal@@ col@@ ates a white basic owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a struggle - supp@@ os@@ edly because of a woman .
Bro@@ oks said that rum@@ or had been in the city that H@@ ester has slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy , and that the baby , which she brought her , not of her husband .
on July 25 , 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land owner , 600 dollars to liber@@ ate Mal@@ com from the prison , the FB@@ I .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cou@@ sins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when it was then removed from the prison , the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge surrounded by a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it represents , it was Har@@ rison , who prepared Mor@@ de , and arranged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; includes a FB@@ I report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is obvious that it was a con@@ spi@@ racy between the state and local prosecution that was not only involved in the murder , evi@@ den@@ ces and identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bro@@ oks formulated it even pre@@ ten@@ ant .
&quot; it was a elec@@ toral massacre , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed in order to send a message to black people in this community &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you sign up , and if you vote , then you will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ and@@ ra Gre@@ ene directed the annual retro@@ sp@@ ell of the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
her representation is descri@@ p@@ tive , moving and is justified in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , of which many believed that he is no longer exists in America .
it is difficult to look at and even more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ chen , because we have con@@ fron@@ ted with its lifting in us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can not build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or not to hear what I have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rehear@@ s@@ als for this year production began in June , and on the first day th@@ ron@@ ged nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - in a room and lau@@ d , as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ installed overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ enes co @-@ director .
he has played the role of the boss C@@ lan@@ mit@@ gli@@ des since years , but he said , the role will never be easier .
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to receive this story in life because we would not want to return to those times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand side of the room , actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , who played the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester to play their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester &apos;s cri@@ es and pressed him , w@@ anting that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he , w@@ asted away from my property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ hid answer is the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone breaks ( at least all black actors ) in laugh@@ ter .
Gre@@ ene laugh@@ s at the loud time .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked of shaving .
he is al@@ arms and conf@@ used .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , always still k@@ ich@@ ever .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t believe that white people at that time &quot; n --- &quot; said &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but , &quot; funny one of the other black actors .
&quot; you must only meet the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and exactly there is the energy in the room , a feeling of camera body replaces the un@@ pleasant .
everyone is busy with this , not only because of the game , but also because of memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts once .
this time , if Ras@@ p@@ elt says the N @-@ word , he says it sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely no man laugh@@ s .
this recovery ends and fast .
there are Schre@@ y , shots , and then silence .
a woman , clothed with a dress @-@ dress , stands on the cor@@ p@@ ses of actors and leads cheap holidays &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; from .
her voice breaks out at every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators were swe@@ pt away and tears out of eyes .
the audience is divided almost evenly between black and white .
one pair is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , traveled to see the performance , many come down the street .
they have lived for almost eight hours , when Bro@@ oks she runs on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
until this point , Mor@@ de remained the mor@@ de , but now when they took place on the same country , where Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels felt .
if the last notes of the songs , Gre@@ ene invites the amount to come closer and insp@@ ecting the dead bodies .
children ho@@ cks to their heads , register the f@@ ake blood , and the silent body and whis@@ per@@ ing one another .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ m@@ ur a little boy when he would remember it .
after a few minutes , Gre@@ ene the amount - and suddenly there is over .
the actors t@@ oss the Lyn@@ x rope away and w@@ ns her tears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , who played the cl@@ an member .
Nick Ras@@ ro@@ man &apos;s two of his fellow players and then breaks into their poor weeping , the emotional load of the performance broke out with him .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; whis@@ per@@ ed one of the women .
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this for a reason . &quot;
later the audience sets up the audience with the actors for dinner together .
at a table pl@@ ush@@ es a white pair of Atlanta , spread over the after@@ ward with a black pair , which they have just learned .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski fought a word to find words which left the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... of people who look like yourself , and they that do , because they look like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what really do I do with me , let me believe that the Lyn@@ ch still continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called the police fo@@ undry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks courtyard keeps to his table , he e@@ ats and remin@@ is@@ cent of the civil rights .
he said he had begun to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reproduction is inspir@@ ing in a certain way , because it describes the terror of what we have learned , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s so , if we learn anything from it , then it can happen again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whoever does not know his own story who doesn &apos;t know his own story is to repeat them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Divine d@@ us@@ k &quot; reconc@@ iled the Wag@@ n@@ eri@@ an in Bayreuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monum@@ ental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf has made a colourful production of gigantic , six @-@ storey back@@ drop .
the fil@@ ming stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows an alternative street corner with the rest of the Berlin Wall , and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pl@@ aste and El@@ ma@@ sts &quot; logo from the GDR @-@ time or the New York Stock Exchange .
before this , an open Mercedes @-@ vintage car , in which the Rhein@@ k@@ ills as Rock@@ erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively a Is@@ etta .
Gest@@ ap@@ ed oil waters remember Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ Moti@@ v - Money , Power and Gi@@ er - which draws together by his &quot; Ring &quot; production .
the three Rhein@@ foolish - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ eel , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra Steiner - harmon@@ ize how already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderful .

later also Gun@@ ther ( Markus Oak ) has to believe in favor .
the audience thanks to the ensemble with vig@@ orous appl@@ ause .
F@@ oster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who hum@@ bled himself and bowed his hands to Merkel @-@ smo@@ ked .
large appl@@ ause there is for the Festival Orchestra , which shows the first time on stage - in view of the big heat again in Leg@@ erer leisure wear .
with voltage expected the appearance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his regional team .
in 2013 , he was still a member of the Pfei@@ fer concert on himself , there were five years later , in which the cov@@ eted &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; went down .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have pleased about that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she had said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience do not only have a form of peace with cast@@ ors but it is also an understanding of its vision .
I go a positive res@@ ume .
max amount works as volunteers
they work in their volunte@@ er year equal to several sites .
where everywhere ?
quantity : normally in stone wood in the furniture stock , once a week I will help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I have already worked in open all day at school .
how are your experiences yet ?
quantity : it &apos;s a nice , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years so a late volunte@@ er volunte@@ er .
how does it come ?
quantity : I have made high school education .
and then a civil engineering , we say successful once again .
I recognized for me that it is false for me and I want to do something else , working with people .
and then I asked me , what do you do .
make a social year , since there is a insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the focal point perhaps , really is .
and was it so ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the winter semester in winter semester .
I will be dual study , probably in the youth office Her@@ ne , probably a social worker education and studying at the University of Applied Sciences in Ham@@ m .
is it not unusual while volunteers have several different locations ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it is probably going to be on where one makes its FS@@ J .
it is possible to make youth work in all possible facets of social work in all possible facets of social work .
it was very varied with me .
I was also part in the O@@ gs , so in the afternoon support .
for me it was exactly the right thing that caused me to ger@@ min@@ ate .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really is going on .
differently than in civil engineering ?
amount : well , here you do not expect to calculate St@@ ati@@ ken .
one has always another man &apos;s head , each of whom have a very different story behind them .
whether a refugee , whether a youth who has been brought out from the family - one must always have to go on .
very interesting .
and they had no contact list ?
quantity : I &apos;m not the guy .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , great kindness .
there are also negative moments , but so it is life .

EPA returns the decision to delay Smo@@ g rule according to cl@@ ages
U.S. Environmental Protection Authority has made a decision to delay a Regulation of the Government of Obama , to which the states are obliged to em@@ bra@@ ve the smo@@ g @-@ caused emissions . this was a day after 15 States def@@ endants the agency because of the stri@@ de .
the EPA announced the decision on Wednesday the decision to describe the so @-@ called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ regulations 2015 &quot; and said they prove the obligation of the agency to collabor@@ ate with states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we respond to our state partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in a declaration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA announced in June , which should be measured in a part of the country &apos;s pollut@@ ant emissions , to establish where the cuts must be made to delay the stric@@ ter air quality standards - to be delayed by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states together with the district of Colombia , filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has attempted to re@@ claim a wide range of environmental impacts , which the former president Barack Obama re@@ covers economic growth , which is to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
however , the efforts have caused the return of the Democrats and nature groups that worry about the effects of larger emissions on public health .
the EP@@ O website says that the in@@ hal@@ e of air , ozone does &quot; reduce the lung function and boost the respiratory symptoms &quot; as as@@ thma .
shared shared space
at the end , the decision was clear : in two objects , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ ning , the establishment of a common space in the future population living area .
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing basic part was signed , Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ ades .
although there are still last to last until now the church is owned by the church &apos;s church , but there is no planning event for the project of private investors .
there is a discussion about a common room .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat are offered to meet the church .
on the ground floor there would be a living area - about 55 square meters - and a adjacent terrace with an area of 70 square meters of space for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the common ground , such a common room is not just as a meeting point for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ oral residence , but open to the church .
as an example , the word of the &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the round .
the decision is disp@@ at@@ ched by the provision of funds for the current budget already last autumn , due to delivery possibilities .
the construction is in the area of san@@ itation .
the installation of a common room would be reported , so T@@ j@@ ades , with 60 percent of 30 percent .
the decision was to sign@@ aling to the investor that you don &apos;t want to throw it in this regard , the conclusion that both sem@@ it@@ ra@@ - - which is reduced to the ambient construction - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - what the Tr@@ amp height reduces and the construction makes it possible .
un@@ necessary , so do not only Wil@@ fried S@@ oh@@ mer , be this addition .
when it helps : unanimously , he has passed the panel .
it is not so easy to get there in common room .
Daniela Call to the many of its own buildings with which you don &apos;t come as right now , it is now right when shared space from the window , she says : &quot; I do not make me difficult . &quot;
Y@@ v@@ onne Sta@@ iger refers to the common room - however , absolutely against a municipal involvement .
she looks after this a covered maximinum payout of alcoholic beverages , or even foreign investors .
this is not so , because with the purchase of the surface it is not possible , but get a real , in the case of doubt , the counter@@ part is the counter@@ part .
Sta@@ ig@@ ator &apos;s application to submit the decision according to the decision , finds three fears .
so , in two objects , with the original program , Stefan H@@ aller , summar@@ ises : &quot; if we summar@@ ise the decision , we make a huge step in our infrastructure . &quot;

to walk in the Harz Mountains of Star
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the resin the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should arise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is planning by the association ob@@ servatory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there have been a plan@@ etary route in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coming to the information need of many harp visitors &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he connect nature , science , movement and athlet@@ ic performance .
the members want to set up along the planned route plates and inform about stars and stars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase to 2018 the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ able installations to five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is planning in the Ober@@ har@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
en@@ quire at St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , brun@@ ette , high priest , and Sie@@ ber .
information on the tablets are to be completed by the internet .
therefore , a good mobile network reception is playing a part of the location selection .
accessibility be a crit@@ erion .
later the star path should be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star path you will learn the viewer a lot of facts about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , they learned why stars were different colors or why a star more powerful than another , even though it is much further away .
then , in which constellation can be found a selected star and when he is best to see .
the association has already been operating in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg in 2014 , which is the highest located ob@@ servatory in Germany .
the plant in the middle of the national park , according to information from the Federal Office of Nature Conservation , is among the six dark regions in Germany .
often from there , the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y are clearly visible .
since 2003 , there have been something similar to the planned mortality rate - the plan@@ etary route since 2003 on the initiative of the Planet@@ arium .
beginning in front of prayer hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the plan@@ etary route runs up to Hain@@ berg and ob@@ servatory - as well as a &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Gl@@ ory ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the st@@ oves with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf @-@ plan@@ ed Pl@@ u@@ to at the end point - are precisely at a distance and a scale of one to two billion .
the earth sh@@ run@@ k like a ball of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the sun measures approximately 75 meters away .
the total distance of the planet is about four kilometres .
during the light from the sun up to the pl@@ u@@ to about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to stop with Pl@@ u@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are so qu@@ icker than the light in the world .
the march to the next fixation would take another half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o meet for the first time , discuss a possible Show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who should stand in a coll@@ ision course to capture the most exciting boxing battle in the near future of 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN @-@ offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ proposed World Box@@ ing Council &apos;s Ligh@@ tweight Champion , down the way down to Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o , the World Box@@ ing Organization Super @-@ Feder@@ alist Champion .
following Gar@@ ci@@ as Victory , the former four @-@ divisions World Champion Adri@@ en Br@@ oner on Saturday at Show@@ time are both fighter members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ list .
Gar@@ cia put forth his right hand , and said , &quot; How does it go to you ?
I wish you good luck . &quot;

when the pair stayed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as noted that a new show@@ down between the f@@ ights would be the &quot; perfect size . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m a former spring weight , &quot; remin@@ ded Gar@@ cia .
&quot; I got up for Br@@ oner &#91; on 140 lbs &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big .
I am small for 140 .
I want to go on light weight .
and he must move on a light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
this is asking the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o voted on .
&quot; boxing needs this battle . &quot;
Klim@@ as asked if it should be to pay at Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy to make Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o with a 135 @-@ pound debut in this year ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) of the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their lightweight mass campaign in the forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this battle could take place in the Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode , because all fans asked him &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Gar@@ cia and pressed later to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can produce this kind of attention .
when always they &apos;re ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said , he sch@@ ise Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o as &quot; an enormous com@@ bat@@ ants , &quot; and he may be able to participate in his Saturday struggle .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o stayed at the generous praise for Gar@@ cia , and said that he think the Thir@@ ty champion from River@@ side see &quot; very slow , I &apos;m sorry for Mi@@ key ... you wonder@@ ing the K@@ o @-@ off . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said , the focus is to show impact strength , then boxes .
both said they could feel the Mom@@ entum , which he built for their own struggle .
&quot; this is the battle that must be carried out .
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
I &apos;m more than happy to work to work , &quot; said Gar@@ cia .
Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o said : &quot; I have been waiting for the top fighters , and this is Mi@@ key .
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injured after tire boards
four people were seriously injured during an accident on the A7 in the morning .
following the first information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira took part in front of the connection station market wide , presumably after a tire boards the control of his vehicle .
the passenger car stops right into the vill@@ agers , where he over@@ threw himself and then kept on the roof in the grave .
four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured during the accident .
during the first supply of the past by the rescue service the A7 towards the north was closed for about an hour , then the traffic on the left hand was placed on the left hand side .
Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; rotating chain works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hop@@ ed after 2 : 2 at the season open@@ er in Braunschweig , making the optimization of the def@@ ensive information in Au@@ e points .
with the first seasonal game Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , as there were not the two oppos@@ ore at the 2 : 2 in Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two areas too much , and we have to fit in Au@@ e even better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ enders of Fortuna Düsseldorf &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turning chain should also be further optimized in the Erz@@ gebirge .
and a fool according to a exemp@@ t , the Fort@@ un@@ ks want to throw again anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , there will be no longer next to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) to the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team also comes better after the experience in preparation with the turning chain better than with the quad@@ r@@ ette .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how we will inter@@ act in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm funk , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we just met in the three positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko G@@ ie@@ ß@@ mann players who can build up well &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is , but that we are still harmon@@ ious and we didn &apos;t aff@@ ord to make a lot of game errors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann is running to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if one could speak of a mis@@ sil@@ ently start , I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we are able to focus on Sunday with four points and can focus on the t@@ rophy , we will surely speak of a regular season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of which his coach wanted nothing to know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start into the season I just follow after six to eight players &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Fried@@ helm funk , who would not want to talk about an advantage against Au@@ e , only because the game of Saxony had to be broken off for an accident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funk@@ y and Hoffmann &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Funk@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said that the player from Au@@ e might be even more fr@@ inge , since they had no heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a ski f@@ iss@@ ors in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know that 100 percent where they are currently standing , &quot; says the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; def@@ enders of the Fortuna . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guests come from the Rhineland as a light Favor@@ ite on Sunday in the En@@ counter at last ( almost ) finished stadium from Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we take away them , only because we have the right to come under the first six , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Funk@@ el &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite a positive defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga , which one must beat out in the second Bundesliga , &quot; explains Advanced Prin@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such a statement would be ar@@ ro@@ gant and over@@ taking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so , Funk@@ el will not want to see his players on Sunday at no case .
new results of the Swedish As@@ yl@@ age Review tests published
the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which were subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age show that more than 80 per cent of the tested persons older than 18 years are older . but not everyone believes to the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( puzzles ) started with the implementation of tests in the past year .
they should be more precise during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish migration Authority ( mig@@ r@@ ations shortened ) for defects in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees had been critic@@ ized .
until today Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ shortened 6.@@ 880 sent to test@@ ament cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2.@@ 481 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency reported that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 432 cases the conclusion was that the person is &quot; possibly under 18 years of age . &quot;
the tests will only be carried out in cases where the age of the person is challenged .
according to Johan G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been established in the past months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not see a great difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases , in which the person was judged as over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers has suffered from his age .
in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there was 4@@ 42 cases that the &quot; propose that the lower person was 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bl@@ a@@ det out the 5@@ 81 published results they found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that they will be 18 years old in this year .
the method of medical age assessment , at the X @-@ ray recordings of teach@@ ings and MRI recordings of kne@@ e @-@ joints are analyzed , which then critic@@ ized by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was also critic@@ ized in some areas .
a sk@@ ep@@ tics is the En@@ doc@@ rin@@ c@@ ologist Claude Marcus des Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institut , whose work has to see the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see if they were earlier or later than usually through the pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used .
assess the biological age in this way , is very un@@ certain .
if we cannot say it , we should not do so as if we could say , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro .
G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency def@@ ended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of paying a child as an adult is small .
the largest risk is in this case , if the person is under 18 , this case is approximately 10 percent . &quot;
full in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the Highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are well ahead .
on Wednesday , a seven tonnes of concrete concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern town entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Easy , Building Manager at the Department of Road Traffic and Transport in the government office of Freiburg .
in April the work began simultaneously on all three san@@ itation bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is planned for October and is sure that the ti@@ met@@ able is scheduled .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ aul@@ ted bridge made of concrete , which is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the two other bridges , it has come into the years now .
in order to ensure the stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are thoroughly renovated .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made in red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were erected in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach is now on Wednesday morning at the north side a 1.@@ 30 meters wide and seven tons of heavy so called Br@@ ück@@ er cap .
this is a bound@@ ary , which is also used as an operating track .
on the southern part of the bridge , a width of 2.@@ 20 m will be used on Friday .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is due .
the special thing is that it is about finished parts , a patent for the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ forced .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented Br@@ ück@@ ers .
particular finger@@ tips has the dispens@@ ing of pipes by the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a glass fibre cable connected to many companies .
the residents were informed in advance of the work by hand @-@ out of the project .
in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be canc@@ eled .
for the bridges between the building building and the collector in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg is regulated by traffic lights .
the road is fully closed for the construction of the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ b@@ acher outskirts on the outskirts of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den . &quot;
the costs for the three lock@@ ers amount to 700 000 euros together .
the whole is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ lower protest at German potato salad
it is not so common to draw parties to a strand , but when it comes to an alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , comes together , what else is difficult to bring to a hat .
the parties represented in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel ( CDU , SPD , Grün@@ e , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Lin@@ ke ) belong to a wide alliance , pointing to that day peace@@ fully , because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle Ron@@ dell is bound to a poster &quot; big election campaign . &quot;
and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who forms the leader with Alexander Gau@@ land to the Bundestag for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the Deputy Chairman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are already in front of the event before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
originally , the city pic@@ nic was planned under the slogan &quot; All on a table &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but takes place on the parking lot below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colorful image that has to offer .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ woman of the Forum A world and one of the decisive organizers , is very glad : &quot; great , how many people come together here . &quot;
there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; ur@@ German potato let@@ tu@@ ce , which could easily eat the Af@@ D without any problems , &quot; says the woman who brought him .
the police arrested many civil servants to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , which shows presence mainly at the train station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .
how is the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ her@@ pes reported from the Af@@ D volcan@@ ei@@ fel that he lab@@ ors for such an event and get an extra charge .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ n@@ ers@@ dorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation , because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us kir@@ ch there is not enough parking available .
therefore , the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ o is pleased that &quot; we can have a nice event here . &quot;
with views of the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz , he says : &quot; this is the good right of the people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
it is also : at 20 o &apos;clock on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle several speakers , among them the Rhineland @-@ car@@ cer@@ ated Af@@ D chairman Uwe Boy .
in the hall there are about 200 list@@ eners that are waiting for the early elections for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Deputy Chairman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch her Spe@@ ech@@ es .
the police presence remains unchanged , but previously the officers had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour is the Af@@ D event , the guests on the court &apos;s place have a longer breath , but also there &apos;s shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can pick up - no special inci@@ dents .

Kri@@ sten Stewart speaks about her bis@@ exual
&quot; some people love gr@@ illed cheese and will eat it until the end of her life .
but I would like to try everything , &quot; Kri@@ sten Stewart completely open over their bis@@ exual .
&quot; if I think once in gr@@ illed cheese I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; .
the most well @-@ known relationship of the Hollywood stars was the &apos; T@@ wil@@ ight &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson that ultimately became bitter .
despite all this as@@ sures the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ erin opposite the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love with any serious , whom I have chosen .
or do you believe , I would have played it ? &quot;
after its separation , Kri@@ sten believed that they have been bis@@ exual : &quot; I had ever lived and believed to have it seriously .
so it has never conf@@ used or ob@@ stru@@ cted me .
I never liked it , not serious , not serious . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially among them suffered from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in school time they prefer as a Bu@@ b : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all the girls are typical girl . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Govern@@ or of West Virginia indicates that he changes the party
the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party .
whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; said Govern@@ or Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of descendants ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will say to you as a resident of West Virginia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would say that it is at the time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before a major announcement at the West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice does not endor@@ sed the democratic mandate of Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice , which is the only billi@@ on@@ aire by Forbes , was elected in 2016 .
Forbes report that he has inher@@ ited stu@@ ff@@ ins in five countries , and inher@@ ited a carbon store from his father .
it is worth approximately 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee announced on Thursday evening a declaration in which it said : &quot; the Party change of Govern@@ or Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party that would rather go to work in order to make our country again . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 coun@@ sel@@ ing and the control of the least legislation in history , the announcement of Govern@@ or Justice is only the last re@@ jection of a party , which is not able to find out from top to bottom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the R@@ NC @-@ chairman R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
CO@@ E lo@@ ys &quot; hon@@ our@@ able &quot; Russian exc@@ use for d@@ oping sc@@ and@@ al
the worldwide leader of the Athlet@@ ics , Sebastian Co@@ e , blessed on Thursday , which he described as obvious exc@@ use from Russia to a d@@ oping sc@@ and@@ al , but he repeated , it is not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed back in sports .
Russia &apos;s Athlet@@ ics CEO D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ak@@ ht@@ in said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the Athlet@@ ics World Championships , that the Verb@@ ung of his country was correct from the sport and that he was determined to fight the d@@ oping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he told him for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes who were put out at competitions gold and silver medals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF congress voted for maintaining a ban in November 2015 , after a report of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence of state @-@ sponsored d@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer , a very good presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the repor@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has proved that they have seen some quite hot times , and everything will be done to ensure that the Federation is redesigned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; CO@@ E said he is also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for his re @-@ integration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constru@@ cting day , and I think that progress has been achieved but the Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment , Russia back again , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gui@@ ding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes of the dep@@ ra@@ ved system , &quot; he added
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will start at the Athlet@@ ics World Championships , which begin on Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still satisfy some of the criteria for re@@ development .
drug tests are still in@@ sufficient and forbidden coach be still free , he said repor@@ ters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .

at a fun@@ eral service in the North @-@ h@@ ess@@ ische Fr@@ itz@@ lar , some 1000 people have thought of the two on a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the Dom@@ stadt under high security arrangements .
the Minister of Defence said in the Le@@ yen ( CDU ) of the Le@@ yen ( CDU ) .
they called the two comments drivers but as &quot; C@@ ould of their expert . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we tend to us before this highest sacrifice , which they have completed in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ pt@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen were killed on Wednesday one week before a week in West African Mali .

in front of the church , Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
the Minister of Defense by the Le@@ yen called the Sol@@ di@@ ced soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and a sat@@ een .
the Stab@@ pt@@ mann took the flight operation of the fighter @-@ helicopter tiger in Fr@@ itz@@ lar with one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his ra@@ iment .
Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , Commander of the Reg@@ iment , said to whom the soldiers were , said : &quot; if the crew could not turn off the crash , nobody would have been mo@@ cked . &quot;
doub@@ ts on the UN Mission in Mali demonstrated the Minister of the Le@@ yen : the use is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he was also of high significance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country where we only separated by two countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the fun@@ eral service , the S@@ är@@ ge was brought out of the cathedral .

Prince Hen@@ rik wants to find a tomb next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried after his death in his wife .
this opened the royal house on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ø@@ r@@ n N@@ ø@@ r@@ ga@@ ard made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for both of them .
the queen may agree with the decision of her husband , it was further in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik was buried , be un@@ clear .
but he did not int@@ ent the intention to be buried in his French country .
Prince Hen@@ rik never made a command that he was not happy with his title .
he became king over the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 .
in 2016 he went into retirement , and also sets the title &quot; Prin@@ ted ahl . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik did not receive the title and function that he wanted to see him not as equal to his wife , but not after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , he explained the chef of the Danish royal house .
where the last resting place of the 83 year @-@ old will eventually be un@@ clear .
but he did not int@@ ent to be buried in his French country , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he worked in the last 50 years .
the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ blem@@ an , had learned Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
in the Th@@ ames he worked in the French Embassy .
during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people always flew to the people , Prince Hen@@ rik , in his nearly 50 years of rain at the Dan@@ es , had a serious stand .
in a auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik sealed about the first years in Denmark : &quot; just a few months after my arrival , everything I did , critic@@ ised .
my Danish was fluctu@@ ating , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk str@@ ing@@ es instead of strips , Citroën instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ yal , which I smo@@ ked in instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco and in this country , I could not hope to hope the brand owner of the intellec@@ tu@@ als .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed .
that &apos;s equal to two errors ! &quot;
Prime Minister Weil wants to re@@ open a new election
CDU and F@@ DP in front of the highest majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red @-@ green government multi @-@ selection for a rapid re @-@ selection of the Parliament , but will not withdraw it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because he spoke to the dis@@ solution of the parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprising withdrawal of a Green Party from its Parliament in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the official date of the Parliament election lost the red @-@ green Coalition in Hanover thus lost its top three @-@ vote majority in parliament to the CDU and F@@ DP .
the previous Green Party El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets founded their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for 2018 in its elec@@ tor in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ üm@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CDU , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover .
CDU Fra@@ ction Bj@@ örn Th@@ ings@@ ler would recommend his fra@@ ction to record them .
in this case , the CDU and F@@ DP were together 69 seats in the Lower Saxony , SPD and founder 68 seats .
so far the relationship was vice vers@@ a .
the new Parliament will be voted on 14 January of the year .
Th@@ ings@@ ler said that the red @-@ green state government had to decide whether they could move in this situation without a majority .
Stephan Weil , however , keeps not indisp@@ ens@@ able that the Parliament quickly dis@@ close its self @-@ resolution .
the CDU faction will probably decide on Tuesday through its further notice .
the state of the state also sees the opportunity that the Parliament &apos;s Parliament will re@@ ject his trust , and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; our Constitution offers several options .
these ways have to be legally checked , &quot; said Th@@ ings@@ ler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in peace all the questions , if they are legally legally checked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ings@@ ler named T@@ West of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but something cur@@ i@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the policies for themselves stressed : &quot; I am not a betra@@ y .
I feel very good . &quot;
she called to be a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the de@@ cent de@@ pu@@ ties to the return of their Land@@ s@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are of course , that she has received her rural estate , that she has received over the green country @-@ list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; divided the leader Meta Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Group &apos;s president Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; we regre@@ t the decision of El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets extra@@ ordin@@ arily . &quot;
she deliber@@ ately decided to lead no pron@@ unci@@ ation in the Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even before the background , there was no induc@@ tive differences , we can not follow this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns insur@@ rection down the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on Green Party El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to the CDU as betra@@ yal .
&quot; the behaviour of former Green Party in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal to the voters and elec@@ tors , but also the betra@@ yal of Red @-@ Green , &quot; wrote the B@@ und@@ esch@@ ef of Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook .
he under@@ support the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to re@@ choose the Parliament &apos;s day quickly .
the withdrawal of Western Europe costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politics of politics &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her last E@@ it@@ el@@ ty and her personal interests in front of the good of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ized SPD @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ and@@ al that the CDU in Lower Saxony makes this dirty in@@ tri@@ vial game and tries to beat out political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nieder@@ ad@@ sen CDU @-@ Fra@@ ction Leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ings@@ ler wants to recommend his MPs to record El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets into the CDU .
the Leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , cast T@@ jack@@ ets , with the personal career of career the results of the Parliament election 2013 .
the CDU was the strongest power in front of the SPD , SPD and founder , however , had a large majority vote in the Parliament .
Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect us from Gi@@ ft@@ ei@@ ern , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses about sigh@@ ed eggs .
how could the sc@@ and@@ al happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) Minister for Agriculture ( CS@@ U ) in the interview with the German editorial network in Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and response .
Mr. Schmidt , How can the consumer protect against po@@ is@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumer inside and consumers , check the eggs in your fridge and check out the stamp pressure .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information on the affected eggs @-@ bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if we are currently able to know a health concern is practically excluded .
now Al@@ di has taken the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs get out of the offer - because the central role of the re@@ conn@@ aissance of the Federal Minister of State has not really been perceived ?
the food monitoring is the role of the federal states .
nevertheless , my House has immediately opened immediately , and has been dis@@ closed since dis@@ closure of Germany in the narrow exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
the trade has the same as the manufacturer to care that the sold products are convenient and health are un@@ th@@ ink@@ able .
if in eggs of the rear high level of 0.000@@ 5@@ mg / kg , these are not capable of traffic .
Un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time does not include establishments .
seats production plants and consumers in the same boat ?
according to such knowledge , the production plants meets no immediate debt .
rather , they must estimate the economic practices of service companies with economic damages due to mut@@ ually illegal practices .
as always there is in the harvest@@ ing too little controllers .
is it only missing at the staff or even at the infl@@ ating jurisdiction ?
however there were just the official controls that have uncovered the process .
however , for the truth , food amounted to 100 per cent of food and criminal energy can never be excluded .
just therefore , a consequ@@ ent re@@ conn@@ aissance of such events and hand@@ over to the prosec@@ utor in the cases , in which criminal cases are possible , of decisive importance .
I have already made several times , that I &apos;m expecting a del@@ ight@@ forward re@@ conn@@ aissance scale by the responsible authorities .
is the regular alarm decoder really necessary in food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get safe and convenient foods .
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de is used in the food industry , consumer goods and consumers are dis@@ rup@@ ted .
by ge@@ ther funds , manufacturers , dealers and consumers are not going to get in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de Fi@@ est@@ il in the attitude of life supplier is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately .
it must be consistently consistently and working with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all the competent authorities that the atomic fact is rapidly and un@@ locked .
how does the finance rules of football on Ne@@ ym@@ ars move to Paris
the rules that aim to prevent im@@ pending issues of the European football club , Ne@@ ym@@ ars world record transfer from Spain to French Paris @-@ Saint Germain are not distur@@ b .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain des UEFA , because the executive organization that monitors the European game has power , teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair @-@ Play rules , which were launched by the UEFA in 2011 , mean that PS@@ G must follow shortly after the transfer of Ne@@ ym@@ ar was financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million US $ ) to buy the Brazilian market from its contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary that will amount to over ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ ym@@ ars move to France .
PS@@ G can loose the money with security , so that Ne@@ ym@@ ar writes and bring him into a galax@@ y of other stars , in view of the team &apos;s financing by the energy @-@ rich ruler family of Qatar .
you may need to get a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but must have legitim@@ ate intake sources , which allow to give them the break @-@ even point in her on the football @-@ based business .
FF@@ P was conceived by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEFA president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs had to have enormous debts after their success , effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ ed to ru@@ in@@ ate if banks or owners moved their support .
in 2011 , the FF@@ P increased from the concentration on the monitoring of their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the Roman Ab@@ ram@@ ovi@@ ch was originally used 2003 in Chelsea - a club with potential bought and then invested strongly to build the crew and to build a global mark - to a tough@@ est matter .
during the current three @-@ year @-@ old FF@@ P reduction period , which runs until 2018 , clubs may take losses of EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the Presidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade 2015 , his UEFA successor to Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to withdraw from excess spending .
&quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we will strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEFA for FF@@ P , compared to The Associated Press in the past week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out cl@@ ause from Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a l@@ ump sum , it can distribute the amount of invoice about the duration of its contract .
Ne@@ ym@@ ar has signed a five @-@ year contract signed , so that the redemption for the next five years will be charged EUR 4@@ 4.4 million in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is located in the possession of Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of EUR 60 million ( then 82 million dollars ) , which later was lowered to 20 million euros , and it was arranged that the teams for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players , otherwise normal 25 players remain limited .
the UEFA is looking for clubs who could try to translate their financing vision by companies that are linked up its revenue by companies that are associated with owners of a club .
while a Catalan company could sponsor PS@@ G , if the value of the sponsor@@ ship should exceed the standard market rates , the UEFA would not apply as a legitim@@ acy .
just this happened in 2014 , when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsor@@ ship of the PSA by the Qatar Tourism Authority has been puff@@ ed up .
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G @-@ payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar could come to Qatar about payments of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have disp@@ uted that Ne@@ ym@@ ar WM ambassador will be able to find out and be an important man@@ oeu@@ vre for the UEFA regulatory authorities just to find out .
the current sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEFA will be more effective every attempt to handle the rules .
the UEFA had no preparatory discussions with PS@@ G about Ne@@ ym@@ ars transfer , to Thursday the people who tru@@ sts in the situation .
they said among the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity with The Associated Press , since they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports that PS@@ G has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015 / 16 with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
accounts for the last year have to be published .
PS@@ G expects that Ne@@ ym@@ ars arrival is a blessing for Spon@@ sor@@ ing Deals , mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot sales .
the association goes out that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing the signature .
the Spanish League was definitely mistaken , one of the best football players to see , and she tried to prevent Ne@@ ym@@ ars Weg@@ ener that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fin@@ anci@@ er d@@ oping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in regards to Kat@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Arsenal manager Ar@@ s@@ ene W@@ enger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , share the reservation of La Liga against a state that financed an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country owns a club , everything is possible .
it will be very difficult to respect the Financial Fair@@ play because one can have different ways or different interests when a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new sho@@ ot@@ gil@@ ant
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y onboard chocolate for Swiss .

as many applic@@ ants there is the tender , the Swiss will not betra@@ y the Swiss .
but in question only Swiss manufacturer come .
according to the newspaper article , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make a renewal of the Treaty establishing the spring of 2018 .
the S@@ DA was the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer not available for a position .
chocolate bars distri@@ butes Swiss Life since 2006 on board their flights .
before Swiss Life had completed a contract with Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut in cooperation with H@@ ug the chocolate tablets .
the possibility to place the logo led Swiss over two and a half years with the start of cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .

&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with its adults who now play adults is less emotional and his par@@ ody is more after the casting @-@ known principle , among them a ri@@ ff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ years like &quot; The hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The hand that looked on the cra@@ dle &quot; ) .
in one point , a character through an Apple @-@ Power@@ book , some in@@ line sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gra@@ cious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ old ) , now Roman@@ aut@@ or , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite More@@ au ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) hasn &apos;t lost its vir@@ ility forever .
and there is another crazy plot plot available in the Ronald Re@@ agan ( as Mr. Show@@ old ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good visual impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always are the courses of the best part of the fran@@ chise .
it makes particularly much fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rud@@ d , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons Unter@@ li@@ pp@@ enb@@ art of &quot; Singles , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old b@@ acker .
there are the moments of random W@@ ahn@@ sin@@ ns , which could reduce this fran@@ chise as a sort of repet@@ itive conclusion : &quot; W@@ ET Hot American Summer : twenty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the band as she will visit the film premi@@ ère of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is remin@@ is@@ cent of a different kind of nost@@ al@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War , &quot; the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even on &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its East @-@ West ring battle @-@ I@@ con@@ ography .
the com@@ edy by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka , created a TV series to be a folded TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , A@@ the@@ ism and the way of Marx@@ ism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main wheels - a hard dri@@ er Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alog@@ ues from Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt will be synchron@@ ized in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice gig to see ( the police exp@@ els the time to view chess in television as Americans may have to do with football ) .
and the list of the famous speaker - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ yal Sev@@ ign@@ y - provides a permanent play &apos; Fin@@ de the voice &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is committed so much for the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a des@@ per@@ ate prop@@ aganda @-@ drums , a mur@@ derer that carries a Re@@ agan mask , it is often used as a single one .
when six long episodes , it moves on , and the com@@ edy is not fast or often enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which was re@@ compens@@ ated on a lower length , because Gregory and I@@ os@@ ef could always visit the American Embassy whose lobby are always occupied by two thick males who swal@@ low a he@@ ap Hamburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message for the imag@@ ined communist audience is that the western culture can do everything for food .
the fic@@ tive Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it even with our own younger history and with the ih@@ oods .
blow against drugs @-@ Mafia in the country
the police succeeded in fighting against the Italian Mafia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ tw@@ ald , Kon@@ stanz , Esslingen and Stuttgart have searched numerous objects like the Public Prosecutor &apos;s office on Friday .
in the age of 25 years and 77 years , they were arrested and issued warran@@ ts issued warran@@ ts for arrest warran@@ ts .
Moreover , there were larger amounts of mari@@ juana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand euros safe .
in the same Raz@@ zi@@ en in Italy , two persons were arrested .
on the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two are therefore expected to be shipped to Germany .
in action , Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved .
in all , over 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
in the Mafia , the members of the Mafia organized the drug @-@ crimin@@ ality , heavy violence , ra@@ isal , as well as rob@@ ber@@ ation and comp@@ ress@@ ors .
since the summer of 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office was determined against the organised drugs in the South German area .
between the prosec@@ utor in Constance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and investig@@ ator of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , the large operations on Wednesday morning were also accompanied by four civil servants from Palermo .
in the vis@@ or of investigations , Italian nationals combined with respect to Italian Mafia .
a incident happened on 27 May in hat@@ s , near the early morning several shots were fired at a restaurant , is likely to go to the bank account .
way a big g@@ aps in the fore@@ igner register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data of citizens who do not arise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : a report , the fore@@ igner regi@@ sters have significant short@@ com@@ ings in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lead to partially engraved mis@@ decisions in asylum procedures .
the Federal Government Commissioner for the refugee management of the federal government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has atten@@ tive to a media report on large g@@ aps in the country &apos;s central register .
def@@ ici@@ encies in case of registered data could cause asylum procedures and deportation , &quot; resulting in an analysis showing the &quot; South German newspaper &quot; in an analysis provided by the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
according to the data , ten million people with foreign nationality are recorded , including approximately 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore managed by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany .
because the data has not been kept enough , the data quality has not been well maintained in parts .
in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; by people who have long been long ago , or of citizens , the German citizen , and are actually not able to dive in the register . &quot;
&quot; def@@ ective data collection , recur@@ ring processes can be significantly slow@@ ing down , &quot; it is called the report .
in the statistics on certain people , EU citizens have been recorded , who would not have to travel at all .
however , such wrong assignment led to &quot; a debate on dealing with checking account , &quot; means it is therefore in analysis .
meanwhile , the Federal Government has revealed that refugee families with under 16 year old children return to Italy if they arrived from there .
this is drawn from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( B@@ AM@@ F ) , &quot; New O@@ zn@@ ore Newspaper . &quot;
according to the paper , the B@@ AM@@ F will perform such procedures &quot; regarding families with children - except for infants and infants - from Italy since 1 June 2017 again . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , the newspaper was not possible anymore because of reference to the difficult situation .
after the Dublin agreement , it is responsible for refugees from the EU state to reach it first .
if a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send him back into the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Office &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Write comments : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the admission capacity for families with minor children in Italy are considerably increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy I submitted for the recording and accommodation of families warran@@ ts .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( E@@ GM@@ R ) hold this respect for sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees to the Dublin City Council .
the inter@@ national@@ ities of the Lin@@ ks@@ fra@@ ction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children threatened not adverse reactions in the Italian asylum system human rights conditions and a companion of child . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 liters of blood from the Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach living people had already been provided for other people .
at least of the twelve citizens , which were received on Friday .
in the meantime , Jürgen Gre@@ ule has sold 50 litres of blood with its now 100 donations .
traditionally , the church is buried in the meeting of the Municipal Council which are multiple will@@ ing@@ ness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is gen@@ ial , as our body is designed and we have respect the don@@ ors respect , which you provide blood for strangers , still in@@ trin@@ si@@ bly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

so , three people could benefit from a blood flow .
at the same time , corn@@ enb@@ acher reported from the actions that were carried out in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this year we achieved the second best result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K cycle leader . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the transition to the theater was evident from a few years ago at higher attendance .

the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rates remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have fought on an increase .
the Bank of England has war@@ ned that economic growth &quot; applications &quot; will remain , when they held interest rates on family income in the middle of a stronger pressure .
the political decision @-@ makers of the Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates on 0,25 % , with less members a rise in this month , since the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened support for an increase .
in its fourth annual inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 % and in 2018 for 2018 , that the pressure would continue to continue on bud@@ get@@ ary . although inflation in autumn is expected to rise to just under 3 % .
but they sign@@ alized that in the next few years of interest rates would be in@@ breeding , and she said that the loan costs may possibly be more than expected to rise in financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw a part of the Mamm@@ ut business package that was published before a year after Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will require time to provide the financing plan for banks in order to provide a budget funding for banks in order to make sure that it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in the frame of this system - with 115 billion pounds Sterling .
minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , as the pressure on real income will continue to use the consumption . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the interest rates it repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to cooling down inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slightly larger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scale required than the markets await . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets forecast the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank emphas@@ ized that increases &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the revised growth forecasts for this and next year , 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the expected last year .
it maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages compared to the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 Euro .
the decision to no change comes after the youngest dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures expected to increase the rising expectations to a interest rate and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months rose to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is slightly ste@@ eping after the Bank at the end of the year .
the youngest inflation report offered a little enthusiasm for households that are affected by a rising inflation and a slight sal@@ aries , since the deep@@ ening will be even worse before they will increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy must not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent the monetary policy in the next few years &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages for the end of their thirty @-@ year @-@ plan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is reinforced by increasing demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak Po@@ unds , which is due to a part of lower consumption spending .
the decision is coming a year after lowering of interest rates to 0.25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the P@@ fun@@ nel .
the Bank estimates that it will probably last four years until this will reach the prices and the economy .
before the last judgement of the Bank to the interest rates , the call was increased after a interest rate , since inflation increased its pressure on hard ur@@ ged households with three political decision makers in July an increase to 0.5 % .
the inflation rate decreased from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected to come again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said , exceeding the exceeding of 2 % in relation to its aim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak Po@@ unds &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , director at Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ ar Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the shortest response market the mort@@ gage market should be stronger competitive , since the loan is strongly looking to shops and end the year in a positive way .
the market is particularly well suited for those who run the existing Deal and the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with free options and low rates are always popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) shall disp@@ oss@@ essed HIV @-@ drug 10,000 people
from September following a fight before the High Court against the financing of the medicine in N@@ HS received access to a &quot; transformed &quot; HIV prevalence .
N@@ HS England announced that one in front of the lov@@ em@@ aking susp@@ icious sp@@ rop@@ hy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection with high risk cancer by around 86 percent , is now delivered by health care about a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he declared himself to finance the process after the Court of Appeal confirmed an appeal by the Supreme Court in the past year , confir@@ ming that the N@@ HS received its powers in spite of the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should finance him .
on Thursday , this was announced by N@@ HS England @-@ CEO Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention &quot; during the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) this was the &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brigh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first , which will follow the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October 2018 before being introduced in England in April 2018 .
pre@@ emin@@ ent sp@@ rop@@ hy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV medicine that are taken before sexual activity to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP is significantly reduced the HIV transmission in inf@@ ectious diseases .
pris@@ m before sexual intercourse means that just enough medic@@ ations are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medicines may be taken every day or as two hours before sexual intercourse .
to those who come to the treatment include s@@ ule or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV @-@ positive partners , which were not successfully treated successfully .
in the clinics are suitable to vote , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known as anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment .
people who are living in England and registered with a physician , can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program is valued at £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for delivery of the medic@@ ations in this week after an international competitive proc@@ urement .
the study will evaluate the entire potential of Pr@@ EP by using clinical evidence as it is targeted in large scale and implemented in a large scale .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should be the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV supplement and over@@ take .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in awareness of one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
Deb@@ orah gold , Chief Executive Officer ( National AIDS Trust ) said : &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV .
pris@@ m , if it is targeted for needy and end@@ anger@@ ed people , the ability to change the English HIV epi@@ demic .
from September to people , people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ financed try in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to a transaction with a partner that leads to many , many lives .
we welcome all of this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now lie down in the whole country and no one who has left a risk for HIV .
now , since the Pr@@ EP test medicine has been certified , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
Sharon Hod@@ g@@ son , sh@@ adows @-@ health minister , said : &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ated implementation by the government and over@@ due .
the evidence show how to transform this drug as part of our approach to HIV prevention and end to termin@@ ate the transmission of this li@@ ve@@ able infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
now it is important that this study is as fast as possible in the whole country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that they may contribute to the dis@@ sem@@ ination of HIV in society a step closer . &quot;
life &apos;s life : mezzanine and cle@@ ver designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court Apartment into a generous home
Jo@@ anne L@@ eig@@ h , a former Ban@@ ker@@ in with a passion for real estate , resi@@ zed in 2014 by a big house in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to an Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed her bags and sold .
&quot; before I lived in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger space , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I sought something that was comparable to my prize .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
I love me in love and made an offer on this day . &quot;
since the first visit the 1,000 square foot has been completely overhau@@ led .
originally a single room with a covered layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne storage space and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my request , &quot; says she .
for this purpose she commissioned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill , which was 12.5 feet high ceilings and a home to create a home , but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms to place each other , so that the architectural challenge was on an mezzanine in which you could stand .
Er@@ fan had to be creative thinking to solve the pre@@ ference .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms that they were scattered over each other , without being b@@ ating to us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it wasn &apos;t just therefore to build a simple platform , but make the steel that he had the right top for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine a classic copper windows of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us can look down over the gl@@ am@@ ous living area .
mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays an role in adding theatre , space and light .
at the two ends is a short corridor mir@@ ro@@ red to leave it longer .
in the kitchen the mir@@ r@@ oring feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance you can offer units place for all stocks and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
due to the perception of a smoo@@ ther space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
assembled kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little of engineering , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important , so that when you slide the door , it is very easy to push . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to cle@@ ver@@ en use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne additional 16 m ² could win , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will sell the base area - or like your property is estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary form a real estate agents will occur and perform a calculation based on the ground size . &quot;
here they managed to enlarge the floor space and use high @-@ quality materials that make the room its luxurious benefits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that you touch and help them to create a emotional binder in a home &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love yourself into electrical sockets in walls .
these are important , but they are not playing with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and increased square @-@ number of a bit standard in something very aston@@ ishment .
in fact , how Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave this .
brothers fight for a 500 million US dollar country imperi@@ al
two brothers are four decades after her Italian family founded the d@@ ynast@@ y , in a debate due to one of the largest real estate Peru@@ vian Vict@@ ori@@ as worth over $ 500 million .
former Director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football @-@ Club &apos; and developers Colin De Lut@@ is lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how its property and its assets shall be split .
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family since 2014 , but a sharp con@@ front@@ ation about the separation will be held in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers 38 real estate worth over half a billion dollars , has been accumulated since the family bought a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood , in 1973 .
the West@@ co Je@@ ans family established there and grew up at a chain of 160 retail outlets .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lut@@ is now includes offices in the Stad@@ tz@@ en@@ rum , developing areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler and shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs .
after an agreement with their de@@ ceased father , Colin - Paul is described as the main operator and the domin@@ ating personality &quot; in the De Lut@@ is family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a trial states says that Colin property is valued at $ 316 million and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a trial point for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Colin proposed officers have left him with what I kept for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed intermedi@@ aries , the first hearing of the Supreme Court was held .
the brothers fight for control of the existing business - where@@ Colin , how Paul claims to have him excluded .
Colin argu@@ ed , that is not true , but th@@ rows Paul to manage some owners .
in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it which was submitted by Colin , he says he hope to stri@@ ve for war .
&quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the cost increases in the case , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , emails and reports of companies , among them Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides with law firm .
Ms. De Lut@@ is and her late husband Luigi were Italian immig@@ rants from the late 1950 @-@ s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , which opened the first je@@ ans@@ ing family in Colin .
Colin says that he began to West Germany when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lut@@ is says that she and Luigi , who died in the year 2012 , hop@@ ed , her property died to their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted to finish the brothers in court &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lut@@ is Group , whereby Colin claims that Mark when leaving the company had paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars .
both Luke and Mark , Paul says , &quot; says Paul &quot; on the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Colin made herself back , even though he was a former AF@@ L member and after a biography from the year 2015 Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of the TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took home with Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is and their forests .
only Colin answered by SMS to say &quot; I can not tell a lot , because the case was before the courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad , very sad , that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and draw our family name by the courts &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Colin wrote in a letter to the Court that he tries to fulfil the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Father had not heard that Paul and I would end in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was still waiting for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our matter will be solved in the near future of the courts , &quot; wrote Colin .
Tr@@ um@@ ps is planning new Chief of Staff to restri@@ ct the media abst@@ in@@ ence of the president .
others tried it and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
polit@@ ico tells us that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restri@@ ct the information flow on President Tr@@ ump - including reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss on a consistent course .
here is a piece of repor@@ ter Jos@@ h Daw@@ sey :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , at his first day of work with executive employees , he set forth a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House , which he would rep@@ airing : bad information that go into the hands of the President .
Kelly said the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in letter - because the President &apos;s better decisions would come if he would obtain good information . &quot;
wa@@ ys Diagn@@ osis makes sense , but others have tried to im@@ print Tr@@ ump by closely monitor its media .
the president Tr@@ um@@ ps relation to television is enough for decades - and now , where he is in the White House , its TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; if the candidate Tr@@ ump was off@@ ended because of an un@@ fair coverage , it was productive to convince him that he received a fair coverage of places that were to convince , &quot; said the former election campaign Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against polit@@ ico .
Polit@@ ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the keys to keep Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter hab@@ its in control , according to six former election campaign officials , to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a ste@@ ady praise . &quot;
okay . okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter are ever &quot; under control , &quot; is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
perhaps this campaigns know something that we do not know others - that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twe@@ ets had to contain more ignition material without their inter@@ ventions .
we probably never know something about the Twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
if his staff had made it several times , trouble shooting from him , then their effort was worth it .
but no one has consistently preventing the tr@@ ump contro@@ vers@@ es .
a part of the problem consists in that people in a White House , which are composed of competing parties , always trying to present their own agenda by promoting tr@@ ump material , that may fo@@ ster their views from the world .
polit@@ ico - entirely with this history - reported in May about the pre@@ ference of advis@@ er to contribute to the president of strategic reasons .
this was an example that was described by repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former tr@@ ump civil servants say that Tr@@ ump can react like a volcano on negative press parts , especially those with damaged Lec@@ ks , and that he could recover it out of this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exactly this happened at the end of February , when som@@ eb@@ ody accused a printed copy of an article of Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet Pro@@ v@@ ok@@ at@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the Deputy Chief of Staff of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a he@@ ap to be of Lec@@ ks &quot; at the White House .
although Johnson has banned from Twitter due to ch@@ ic@@ ans , or that he has no concrete evidence , or that he is expressed in the past false alleg@@ ations and contra@@ di@@ ct them .
Tr@@ ump read the article and began to in@@ quire about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
in addition , Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tries to implement a system to manage and document the Tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly tries to do the same for three months later .
perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as a pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ er still continues to influence .
these distinctive factors do wa@@ ver@@ ys mission very difficult .
master@@ ing crimin@@ als get mail from Europ@@ ol
since the address is unknown , the assistance of the population is praying and hopes .
the police have been sent out throughout Europe in this summer ( virtual ) postcards about dangerous crimin@@ als on the flight .
since the addresses of the requested sever@@ als are not known as well , references from the population will hop@@ ed and pray .
Europ@@ ol reported on Friday of the action which follows the &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; -@@ Advent calendar from winter .
the experience could have shown that a lot of vol@@ at@@ ile in vacation facilities , it was called Europ@@ ol .
you have compiled 21 postcards for requested crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , the website has been www.@@ e@@ ager@@ ly wanted , more than 2.5 million times has been viewed .
36 of the online voc@@ alists have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to the release on the website .
trav@@ ellers on a gr@@ ate and return to the &apos; million@@ th series &apos;
some of the we@@ al@@ thi@@ est house owners of West Mid@@ lands are back with some un@@ disp@@ uting trav@@ ellers on the war , which have tra@@ ded one from the municipality to re@@ claim a field in front of their houses .
the trav@@ ellers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside of a we@@ al@@ thy road of Soli@@ ds , which is called &quot; Milli@@ on@@ är@@ s series . &quot;
they have brought horses , babies and a army of transports , after being thrown out in May , without being thrown by a tr@@ ench tr@@ ench to prevent their deposits .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in defense units and pressed her vehicles by a section that remained un@@ ob@@ stru@@ cted to find a way .
the residents agree to the Council of Soli@@ ds , said that it was &quot; useful to deal with the problem . &quot;
an anonymous residents said : &quot; they were on Monday evening , after they were sent out by Bentley He@@ ath , where they were cast stones onto the passport .
the Council must be forced to implement the problem in fact when dealing with the problem .
the trav@@ ellers in May there were moved and now back again .
more on yesterday evening , probably even more . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to move it by sending a long instruction to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I live in the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy , continue to pay my common tax if the Council can &apos;t stop once . &quot;
a resident who would not want to be called , said : &quot; it is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , we have just seen the last round of this trip , only by one another round .
the numbers have been increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park . &quot;
a spokes@@ person of the Council of Soli@@ s said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to keep them as soon as possible .
to support our white data collection , it is very important that as many as many people as a anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police report by calling 101 .
this helps to create a picture of the situation where the court must examine when we place our case . &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is located in Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is located from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on March 1 , next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closing of the hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof with the then ambi@@ ence of the hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof , approximately 30 000 overn@@ ights were lost per year and also revenues by the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in view of the numbers of refugees , which came into the county , the hotel building was offered to the country and as a collective accommodation , which was directed to controversi@@ al discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers to secure the area as hotel location .
the decision was not disp@@ uted at the age at that time .
but mainly Freu@@ den@@ stadt Julian Oss@@ wald def@@ ended the hotel site and then spoke of serious interested in the house .
he should keep right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ouse with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ians has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof with a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again at a house of the three @-@ star @-@ Plus Category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter facility .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ians and one in Bad Her@@ ren@@ al@@ b .
you are called Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ is@@ en@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof , there have been a longer time @-@ container before the entrance , and when you enter the house , it will clearly be done what extensive renov@@ ations will be made .
the so@@ ils were removed , bl@@ ank@@ ets , partly dismant@@ led , ancient bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a only building site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; it is a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is supposed to be renewed in the Black Forest .
the rooms are equipped with large be@@ ak showers , the input range is designed , the new window will be installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer ex@@ presses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jew@@ ellery . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and meeting room are part of the equipment .
it can not be positioned at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but is already emphas@@ ized at the high level of the city .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms would set up broad , explains Sch@@ erer .
both holidays , groups or business experts are to feel at home in the hotel .
convers@@ ations with O@@ B Julian Oss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael K@@ rau@@ se he had already led , so Sch@@ erer .
the performance of the city are covered with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the investment of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer will not want to be precise .
just under one million euros , it calcul@@ ates .
the outer systems are also brought to the fore@@ man , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , a large terrace , which is publicly accessible from the restaurant , which is publicly accessible .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : US Special Jury Prize
in Russia &apos;s aff@@ air by US President Donald Tr@@ ump , he allegedly committed a so @-@ called Grand jury after a report by US President Donald Tr@@ ump .
the Committee recorded the work in the past few weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; on appeal to the case .
the paper read the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller had expanded its investigations and intensi@@ fied .
the transmitter CN@@ N reported it is already the first inv@@ itations of the Gre@@ mi@@ k in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps el@@ dest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. secret services acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin since extended to have targeted targeted in the presidential campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller examined whether they spoke between Tr@@ um@@ ps election team and Moscow .
in the focus of the investigations , several men are to stand in the election campaign as consultants of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to report , Mu@@ eller also took more and more Tr@@ um@@ ps private and business environment among the micro@@ scope .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote some weeks ago that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post wrote personally to the center &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and asking the alleg@@ ations that the President in the course of the aff@@ air might ob@@ stru@@ cted the justice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jur@@ assi@@ ys is to check and decide to verify whether the prosecution is to be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore called Prosec@@ ution .
mostly they are switched on if there are larger and controversi@@ al cases .
the procedure always takes place behind closed doors .
the committee can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor to invite people to the hearing below E@@ id .
according to the CN@@ N transmitter , there were already pre@@ aches to make the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
persons who were involved in the meeting was asked to be called by a statement , it was called in the report .
Moreover , they should provide documents .
next to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. were Tr@@ um@@ ps advis@@ er and law @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his fellow election of Paul Man@@ a@@ fort .
legal experts said on Thursday evening in the US television that the obj@@ ectiv@@ ity show that Mu@@ eller may not be so@@ ber in his work , and that it should be necessary to act quickly .
however , it must not necessarily be called the Grand Jury at the end to decide on the survey of an acc@@ us@@ ation .
nevertheless , the establishment of the Gre@@ mi@@ ths of the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new reason to concern the concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the middle of the new dis@@ closure of the President on Thursday evening a speech in West Virginia , in order to present the Russia aff@@ air as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; Russia history is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump .
the topic of the Democrats give a possibility to feel &quot; to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about it . &quot;
his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a position , he did not know anything from the en@@ forcement of a Grand Jury .
but these work usually work in sal@@ aries , he stressed .
the White House advoc@@ ates any measures that accelerated the work of the special event on &quot; fair &quot; mode .
the former FB@@ I boss James Com@@ ey said three times that he would not be determined against the president .
I have no reason to assume that something has changed something , it was further in the declaration .
but Mu@@ eller had been used only after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had been fired .
because of this ass@@ ump@@ tions were di@@ min@@ ted against Tr@@ ump , he would aff@@ ord the j@@ udi@@ ci@@ ary of justice .
in June , Com@@ ey said to a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him for a attitude of investigations against the then national security consultant Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the president is due to the investigation under large pressure .
according to the evidence of US media , the White House Material gathered together against the Special En@@ medi@@ ator and his employees .
that dis@@ band@@ ed spec@@ ulations about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller would be released .
unlike an independent special issue of Congress like about in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate aff@@ air around the late President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has made a position in which he could be fired theore@@ tically at the President of Justice of Justice .
several transmitters of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic Sen@@ ators set on Thursday bills of bills , after which the special comm@@ its could not be released so easy .
Antar@@ ctic : gigantic Eis@@ berg drives in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the West@@ ant@@ ar@@ ctic a gigantic iron ore has solved almost seven times the size of Berlin from Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
this was the Zar@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener @-@ Institut for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the over one trillion tons heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometer large th@@ oss t@@ oss now to the north and will probably take two , three years , until he is melted .
it is with 175 kilometres long and a width of up to 50 kilometers one of the largest iron , researchers have registered in the last three decades .
a danger for people will not depart from him .
in what extent of climate change has played a role in the breakdown of the ice@@ berg , it is un@@ clear after research .
however , the US Research Center for Snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) has existed for around 30 years in the region , however , writing the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( NS@@ IDC ) .
according to many researchers , the global warming could be merged with global warming .
the broken colonies has been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is so far .
Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is floating on the sea and is fed by big gl@@ ac@@ iers .
it is always growing to the sea and breaks regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the top of the ant@@ ar@@ ctic Peninsula .
the north of this spring was the balance of wax and dis@@ rup@@ ted some years ago .
a complete shot is there , A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes .
there is a lot that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is in danger , because the front edge have never withdrawn so far as far as currently .
in addition , the ice plate stands out of voltage and could be cut off , if a piece is ab@@ locked in one piece .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is and Eis@@ berg increases the sea level as they swim in the water and ice as much water as it yields after the melting itself .
however , the loss of the shaft indicates that the gl@@ ac@@ iers can go directly into the sea and much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the level of sea level , but only in a low degree , writes the British research project for observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is the fourth largest Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is of Antar@@ c@@ tica with almost 50 000 square kilometers .
on the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 metres thick , on the front edge for the free ocean about 200 meters .
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural event and is not aware of direct connection to climate change , the iron sign comes to a dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary of British S@@ wan@@ sea University &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is the most significant retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; confirmed too .
among scientists be controversi@@ al if the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is now grow again or in the long term , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that there will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last for decades .
even if this researcher did not lead the break of this gigantic iron ore on climate change , however , in recent decades , however , many ic@@ eb@@ rows of Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have been broken .
this long top of Antar@@ c@@ tica extends in South America .
according to data of the research program British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ic@@ onic area of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s .
to decrease the temperature increase .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have been heated by around three degrees in the past 50 years and therefore tell the areas where the temperature at the fastest sti@@ ff .
CDU intends to be home to the personnel
because there is more difficult to occupy free @-@ to @-@ use places , the CDU , from emplo@@ yers , calls for more attractive .
just before the summer break the Kre@@ ist@@ ag has reached 41 new jobs in administration .
more than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have got their first working day behind him .
the teaching position in the circle are obviously very desired .
some 620 applic@@ ants were recorded for this year .
nevertheless , the circle is missing staff to handle the increased requirements and tasks .
at present , there are no occupied places in the circle M@@ ett@@ mann as of 50 .
we are looking for doctors and engineers , as well as forces of the general administration .
the CDU would now want to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG initiative and gent@@ len@@ eck in the Administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the administration should work according to the request of the parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a concept for identity and staff development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to cover not only short @-@ term requirements for professionals , but future @-@ oriented to the applic@@ ant &apos;s scar@@ city , it is called .
the overall concept should be oriented towards the inside and outside , concrete measures for trans@@ verse beginners and an exempl@@ ary offensive , require CDU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that list@@ ens to a good approach .
for the circle it has to do with personal problems you knew earlier this .
other cities provide good civil servants and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
the speech is of a regular &quot; competition of public employer . &quot;
in addition , there is a high number of employees , the disease or old age from the service .
so the highest time to sleep , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , leader of the CDU , goes beyond his party beyond the common request .
he cared for a fine @-@ thick surprise in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag for a f@@ aust@@ thick surprise when he set up the personnel ticket public in question and bl@@ oss@@ oms the rest of the parties .
nations would like to be reviewed all the possibilities that permit a withdrawal from the municipal emplo@@ yers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term , the county government should attend the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the national cities - a pet tariff , &quot; so people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this , the CDU , the employees and civil servants tries to pay better than the tariff of public service was actually fore@@ seen .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly pre @-@ written , increases or more money only if you are moving into a higher level that is oriented towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle has grown steadily over the past few years .
only a few weeks ago new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stit@@ ching protection law .
not least by the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ director Martin Richter a problem : they have too little personnel .
Italy dis@@ band@@ ed the sound to NGO @-@ Mig@@ rants rescue
in Italy , NGOs , the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , war@@ ned that they may not continue to continue to keep the rules of their operations .
&quot; if NGOs have no new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work on , &quot; said Interior Marco Min@@ n@@ iti said in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ it@@ is warning was a day after the Italian authorities had conf@@ is@@ cated a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; Youth R@@ ettet &apos; , because their crew worked effectively with tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ kers in a way which facilit@@ ated the illegal immig@@ ration .
the aid organisation , which has been in operation only since one year , refused to be expressed by the Italian national@@ it@@ alia Am@@ bro@@ gio Cart@@ osi@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us and remains the salvation of the human life our top priority . so we &apos;re sorry that we can do not operate in the search and rescue zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in a position on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can assess all the charges , who only assess , after we collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had the boat from &apos; Youth R@@ ettet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
it is thought that his crew takes place infl@@ atable migrants who are delivered to them directly from tra@@ ff@@ ers , and that the dirt road can be used again .
at least one of these efforts were supposed to be held just 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the nu@@ des of the prosec@@ utor , whose content was published by Italian media .
the crew is suspected to take over the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not from any other moti@@ ves .
under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats have to have used boats such as I@@ u@@ vent@@ a mainly a Italian police officer , which monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have now been prepared to hold the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be un@@ necessary but un@@ acceptable , since they would no need &quot; major changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue actions .
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates for Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
Min@@ n@@ iti said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the emergency measures in Italy , in the last weeks , that the efforts to strengthen Libya &apos;s coastal forces and the collaboration with local bourgeoisie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he gave plans for further discussions with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with Ch@@ ad , Niger and Mali over measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
nine W@@ eil@@ mer B@@ iker , the &quot; Berlin Foreign Policy , &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the northern Palat@@ inate for four days of tri@@ als and sights .
there were three friendly guides available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ enh@@ eimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for touring .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est from Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led to the village of Micha@@ el@@ sk@@ ap@@ elle at hot summer temperatures above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
there followed observation points , partly to towers , from which you could see far beyond the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest and the pre @-@ finished levels .
in between there was always longer asc@@ ents for the long Tri@@ als .
on the second day it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and the folk festival Wur@@ st@@ markt .
again , look@@ out spot on the look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
at the last two days , many al@@ ti@@ meter were said .

after 173 kilometres and nearly 4500 meters of altitude , the group had lear@@ nt the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest from its best side - sporty and cultural .
console instead of lawn - division equipment for e @-@ sport
sit the sports stars in front of computer consoles , rather than going through wind and weather over the st@@ adi@@ on@@ r@@ ens to fight ?
fact : E @-@ Sport is long ago to become a serious business , has become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - great stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high g@@ ages .
this also recognized the first German lig@@ c@@ aver@@ ages that increasingly eng@@ age in this area .
in early 2015 , the V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg , later followed by FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , followed by a E @-@ Sport division and took two pro@@ s for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to insp@@ ire all new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says the Executive Board Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this train , some clubs get off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , FIFA World Association organizes FIFA World Cup in London to compete against each other in London &apos;s first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup . &quot;
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfsburg , for example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven qualified .
Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has meanwhile been an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real soccer must be dealt with the 14 @-@ 30 year @-@ old that young people still go into the stadium , &quot; says the 52 year old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : we tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian , to conquer .
with prominent e @-@ sport fans under contract , one could be present online by more often on these markets , as only once in the year the Federal g@@ am@@ an@@ ship would send to Asia .
what is it exactly ?
in the E @-@ sport , computer games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike , &quot; or just the football @-@ simulation FIFA on competitions level .
long ago , as in normal sport , since the normal sport , the pro@@ s have established themselves to compete against each other .
and with the Asia Pacific , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official programme .
but is it all about a correct sport ?
for many is the performance of ordinary requirements .
Ingo F@@ rob@@ atic has dealt very long with the question .
for the professor at the German Sports@@ - School in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competent and many biological and physical reactions show that one can find in classical sports , for example , increased heart rate , stress reactions , hor@@ m@@ onal changes .
in addition , it need cogn@@ itive skills , an technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast response .
professional Gam@@ er should not only exercise on the console but also exercise their body and consider the diet .
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ rob@@ atic sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; d@@ oping is always more a theme . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
checks are difficult for online games , and in the scene lack@@ ed the structures of classical sports .
scientists reveal the high integ@@ rative effect of the E @-@ Sports .
players are internationally on the way , that &apos;s like a great global family , there is no intercultural inhibit@@ ors .
a study of the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Inter@@ active Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) says the E @-@ Sport a rapid growth ahead .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and large tournaments .
sales in three years are expected to be 130 million .
against the almost 2.4 billion euros of football player this is little .
however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports like hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultant .
International are many countries already .
great markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez is participating in the US Team N@@ RG e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton K@@ ut@@ cher invests in the e@@ Sport @-@ Wet@@ tan@@ ker Uni@@ que .
a lot in Europe also does .
in a Norwegian school , E @-@ Sport was introduced as a lesson , says F@@ rob@@ otic .
in the Netherlands and in France , the S@@ occ@@ er @-@ First liga @-@ Ver@@ ein is obliged to set up a E @-@ Sport division according to D@@ utt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison list Germany , V@@ f@@ B Member of the R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter , because of the texts that Conrad Roy &apos;s suicide in prison
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encour@@ ages her boy@@ friend and calls for suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their convic@@ tion behind G@@ ay and five years were exposed to mal@@ nutrition .
Carter was sentenced on 13 July 2014 for the killing of Conrad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My family is invisible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until calling .
she was con@@ fron@@ ted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but their legal representatives argu@@ ed that both they suffered as Mr Roy with a mental illness .
in red tro@@ users and a cream colour bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down@@ wards eyes when they were condemned .
&quot; their actions have brought Conrad Roy , &quot; said the prosec@@ utor in judgment .
&quot; she finished his life to make their own better .
she has no responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; she has shown no Reu@@ e . &quot;
but Car@@ ters At@@ tor@@ ney at At@@ tor@@ ney , said it is a &quot; horri@@ ble conversion which they totally regre@@ t@@ ere . &quot;
judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he didn &apos;t find out that their &quot; age or ri@@ pen@@ ess or even her spiritual disease have a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , the alleged that there is no one day , in whom I do not pray to the loss of my beloved Son .
I want that he is proud of me and how I &apos;m proud of all . I try to bear despite all my pain , which we will be able to be for eternity with us , for his sisters , it is called it .
Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ d@@ yn Roy , said that they will never be prosec@@ uted by knowledge , &quot; that they would never be able to participate in the wedding of their brother , or to be a a@@ unt for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer have the one person who have been together since my birth , is a pain which I will always hold on my life for the rest of my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent since there is no law in Massachusetts , which accounts for a crime , to demand another suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case moved to national attention , after Car@@ ters text releases that she had encour@@ ages him to complete his life .
&quot; hanging on , spring of a building , Dep@@ eche yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news , which she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was with his family in vacation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the eyes of his suicide she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to do , Conrad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All that you have to do is direct the generator , and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter sought attention through the death of Roy , and ordered that they should benefit through any of the case .
the legal opinion has dealt .
during the few years , Am@@ anda Knox , Am@@ anda Knox , was convicted of murder of her British fellow citizens in Italy before being acquitted for two years ago .
Ms. Knox , 30 years old , published in Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deserv@@ es compassion and help , not jail . &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ i : learning from the new mini @-@ Lah@@ m of the FC Bayern
that Joshua K@@ imm@@ i could run at the Audi Cup as captain of the Audi Cup , is no co@@ incidence .
the FC Bayern tr@@ ench the Con@@ fed Cup winner a great season - Extra motivation will not be available .
something similar to his place in the cabin , which saw Joshua K@@ imm@@ s immediately , even if the additional garment was very small , very small .
but as far as wide and wide on the second day of Audi C@@ ups there is no chance to see Philipp Lah@@ m and also no Manuel New to see him , he did the split up of the arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer did not have announced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told the Con@@ fed Cup winner , after his first use as Bavaria @-@ Captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good , the entry would have to run better than at 0 : 2 vs the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of the coach could I end as so .
not the eight years old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was one of the young people who have been chosen as a game leader in youth , deb@@ ug@@ ging and just off the vacation .
sugar is distributed to those who want to keep lots of those who want to hold on the mood .
if you were able to leave the L@@ ame for Lah@@ ain@@ an , a small extra motivation may only be used .
K@@ imm@@ i confirmed : &quot; this is what you want to do as a player : responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old was a mini l@@ ame over the field .
on the right side , that is now its position , the white Bin@@ de at the arm did its rest .
and at all , K@@ imm@@ I took part in this starting information such as the one that can take the rest of the best in the hand .

this didn &apos;t work well .
Sü@@ le ran apart from K@@ imm@@ i , Rud@@ y in front of the gun , both ag@@ ated sou@@ di@@ ene .
the nam@@ ing of Nap@@ oli @-@ Sturm often did seriously , in addition , Sü@@ le tried to have a few times in the game building .
his colleague Rud@@ y existed that the outcome was &quot; not so , as we hop@@ ed ourselves . &quot;
but he also showed an ordinary performance during the debut .
game change , template : &quot; for this style I was brought again . &quot;
as Un@@ used this Bavaria @-@ World still for the new beginnings , it looked to the game .
Rud@@ y for example was not one or two , but determined six or seven interviews .

there he heard of Sü@@ le one interesting set : &quot; what &apos;s going on here , I have already noticed .

Audi will change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are con@@ fron@@ ted with a counter@@ reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi told BMW , that it would be able to update the software in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
the BMW @-@ chairman said , the company is the opinion that &quot; it is intelligent options as driving restrictions , &quot; and it went to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is resident in diesel vehicles , to restri@@ ct or restri@@ ct diesel vehicles .
Daimler was announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
one of the companies described the companies as a recall .
European Automobile Manufac@@ tur@@ ers have encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon emissions .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it the diesel engines are considered car@@ cin@@ ogenic and can cause as@@ thma .
the cost of car manufacturer to install the neutr@@ alisation of diesel vehicles from diesel vehicles will also take to what it makes difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged to ignore the mighty car companies and signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the error of Volkswagen , which could regul@@ ate the use of so @-@ called bi@@ ans devices to regul@@ ate the regulations when a car was tested , but for normal driving conditions .
several employees were indicted in the United States , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be put into court in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was introduced in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen , after the authorities had accused the system to handle the emission regulations in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States was expanded .
the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could be heavily loaded : the luxury car manufacturer carries over proportional to the profit of Volkswagen .

mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ itt@@ enn@@ ings and laugh@@ ter against the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the most widely published cartoon animation , the buttons of his figures are his trademark .
also at 85 the Argentin@@ ian still stands and works in a film .
his message : laugh@@ ter , &quot; because there is too much harm in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immig@@ rants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he defeated himself as a dra@@ fts@@ man for lucky cards - which was fru@@ str@@ ated by him .
&quot; the happy day in my professional life was the day when he lost my job , &quot; he said once .
following the stations in Lima , New York and Paris , in the late &apos; 60s the breakthrough : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in the &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo took many fans .
and again , the artists who inspired cities to insp@@ ire .
great , all @-@ all Mor@@ di@@ llo figures bed@@ side table with the shooting tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
at the early morning he sits its own information on the drawing day , and works almost ten hours daily .
over calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ Shirts , pl@@ ush favorites and clo@@ cks are still much spreading worldwide .
he has been working on a cartoon animation and a TV series for six years .
the main person in the film &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - the most popular animal in his drawings , who has an thousands @-@ feet as counter@@ player .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , the 2019 on the Kin@@ ol@@ ein@@ wall .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what they say , it is strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo .

lav@@ ender from Provence by climate change
he became a symbol of the Provence in Southern France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
lav@@ ender is remin@@ ded of the conditions of Dür@@ re &apos;s conditions and because of the diseases transferred to in@@ ev@@ olu@@ tionary insec@@ ts , scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , large head@@ ache .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institute CR@@ I@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the Lav@@ en@@ del in Provence is effective , because the plant was exposed to climate change over the past years , that in spring much less rain and in the autumn much more .
this has effect on the lif@@ esp@@ an of Lav@@ en@@ del .
there is also a small Z@@ ik@@ ade , a mic@@ rob@@ otic membrane , which transm@@ its di@@ aph@@ rag@@ m , and there are very many of them . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
lav@@ ender oil is not only for vac@@ ation@@ ships , it is also asked for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said , &quot; instead of very long plant watches with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , UN@@ TER@@ EN@@ TW@@ IC@@ K@@ EL@@ TE and either lack or weak@@ ened .
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
for the solutions that are considered to be considered a better water distribution and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the ground , but also the occup@@ ations of plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to drying .

the assassination of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce arrive normally on Wedn@@ esdays to review their plans for the reporting of the youngest chaos within the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by the organized crime , corrupt civil servants and ir@@ regular drugs .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it was told them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists will discuss what is safe : you should take their children with the office in 2009 which were the goal of a attack with Gran@@ ts , or to leave them at home .
security experts have three words on a panel on the front of the room : opponent , Neutr@@ ale , Al@@ lies .
it is necessary to propose a repor@@ ter , names for each column - no evidence is necessary , perc@@ ep@@ tions and pan@@ ic .
there are drug ad@@ gler , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand at the salary list of the government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of crimin@@ als which make the chaos of Mexico .
there is no silence of violence , and during the whole country the cor@@ p@@ ses are more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto entered its office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are under attacks and thre@@ ats under federal protection and until now there were at least seven deaths in seven countries .
among the latter is her editor and her in@@ spir@@ ator of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the Mit@@ fo@@ unders Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books about violence in connection with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is deeply impressed , even though its presence is present - a large photo of Val@@ dez , which shows its middle finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; . two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts , that demonstrate its sm@@ iling face with glasses or typical pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop will take place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their divided themes , trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , ins@@ om@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
even though 2010 was created by the At@@ tor@@ ney General , in order to process the cases of journalists , this is directed according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists , only two criminal proceedings .
as with most thousands of Mor@@ den , who are associated with drug trading and organiz@@ ational crime every year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists only rarely be charged .
at Ri@@ odo@@ urs , they still consist on to handle the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although it is illegal and even though the terrain is still ro@@ uted .
without information on the mur@@ derer , without righteousness , the meeting on the discussion of safety has little benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very stup@@ id to turn my time in this workshop , &quot; says he .
&quot; as long as we know why we know all . &quot;
on the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a couple of blocks before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was forced by two men . it was forced by his car and was shot in him for 12 times , probably due to the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; 12th &quot; river . &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius drove away in his car and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the topic of Val@@ dez there are practically nothing in silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans &apos;s arrest in the past year and of extra@@ dition to the United States in January was Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the bloody slaughter fields of the country , since riv@@ alis@@ ing fra@@ ctions fight here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a each day someone will be shot each day or several people on the street , or that the gra@@ vey@@ ard is full of en@@ chan@@ ted , two @-@ store@@ yed Maus@@ oleum that are larger than many houses for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; rest &quot; if only a cart@@ el control over the coastal waters with its valuable har@@ bours and drugs trade routes in the United States .
nevertheless , in spite of the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the d@@ angers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , with the fault that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two abuse have contributed to the murder .
in February the publication of a interviews with Dam@@ o L@@ op@@ ez , a leader of a riv@@ alled cart@@ el fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have been missed the children , having believed the power issued every copy of the issue , as soon as they were extra@@ d@@ ited to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke .
the second fault was in that Val@@ dez did not force to force after the arrest of another newspaper that had published the same history to leave the country for its own safety .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had so long survived that his friends and colleagues would say that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este when he completed five colleagues to the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars investments .
in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism , without stum@@ ble to the noise of the noise , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
with the time , the newspaper had served as a reputation because of cour@@ age@@ ous and hon@@ our@@ able reporting , and sales and advertising .
repor@@ ter it , hard tre@@ st@@ ating investigations without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were fascin@@ ated by a publication that they could read stories that nobody else could be treated .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ urs , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot prize &quot; for their coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists in the persecution of the Mexican drug history , where she also led them .
he gave will@@ ingly that he had fear .
&quot; I want to live , &quot; he said at the time of CP@@ J .
drug trade in Sin@@ alo@@ a , is a way of life , &quot; said he in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV last October .
&quot; you need to take the task that will take you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would not want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done ? why did you not tell what happened before ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ urs team missed Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird that could curse the friend who was gener@@ ously with h@@ ug and rating attacks , a teacher who knew how to survived .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always bear his hat .
he would always be to El Guay@@ ama , the bar opposite the office , go and sit always at the same table .
now they ask : was his love to be a routine ?
his death has also been forced to ask her own interests in question as they can do their work on the best and staying alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it , if you are dealing with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret starting and landing ways to move drugs .
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ scen@@ ic and self @-@ maintenance .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it is wrong , lead them away .
the trouble is , the publisher of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real is that &quot; smell a sense that can be mo@@ cked ... and then the thing happened with Javier . &quot;
the old rules , such as he and others say , are in Sin@@ alo@@ a no more - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states , where a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative dirt , weak institutions and corrupt government officials .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the room where the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for security training , there were suddenly no cell@@ phones allowed . days earlier this sp@@ y@@ ware that is sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
there were two polic@@ emen to protect against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ urs in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ class quarter of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the sh@@ ear , some of the repor@@ ters , whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of polic@@ emen who were not tru@@ st@@ worthy of the governor itself as not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
it is months ago since the repor@@ ters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drugs bound de fac@@ to are under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has moved to three main stories .
there was the assassination of the former Box@@ ers Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the state expend@@ itures , focused on the hom@@ etown of the governor .
and there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the state @-@ old , a kidn@@ apping guided tour .
there was no official word that was ab@@ duc@@ ted or as it was done so be careful when everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favourite locally of drug tra@@ ders and authorities .
a repor@@ ter found out of public records that the restaurant has been registered under the name of a policy , who ruled the rule of the Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( pr@@ i ) , who ruled all political levels throughout the whole century .
recently , several pr@@ i govern@@ ors were accused of corruption in corruption .
in order to write the repor@@ ter concerning previous inci@@ dents in this locality , in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man had escaped a military failure .
only a few months before the readers of Val@@ dez had previously viewed as the best informed source about the ab@@ duction .
&quot; previously , we knew what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its slim body .
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez was dedicated to storage space for signs and st@@ ic@@ kers , dedicated to the murder of journalists , because the staff had become something , what they would never expect : activ@@ ist in the name of the press .
repor@@ ter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez sn@@ app@@ ed a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration for another journalist for the office of the office .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body was discovered and civil servants say , based on DNA tests that it is of it .
in all the country , journalists has grown stronger , having written in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on obe@@ dience and builders .
this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is in Washington and tries to gather international support for justice in the Val@@ dez case .
at a meeting with Govern@@ or of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities to express journalists and bring them to the truth , because they have told the truth .
it has been asked since then that it is divided by the government because she is concerned that their rage has injured their obj@@ ectiv@@ ity .
Val@@ dez was repeatedly stated that journalists in Mexico from organized crime , involved government officials and a valid society . &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ journ@@ alism &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters are not only to be killed by drug law , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces that put together with the organised crimes under a ceiling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the media group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; performed more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and civil servants last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Mexico die , because they would like that you keep the mouth , &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez .
obviously the Mor@@ a have a terrible effect .
nobody is forgotten the death of the Blo@@ g@@ inist Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .

din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ouflage to soak up his enemies
at first glance , it looks like a statue as well as a sc@@ ep@@ tible .
now , researchers found that the first findings of the incredible r@@ hin@@ der of a Canadian min@@ ers have been so good that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they could even determine that his shoe skin was from red@@ dish Braun - and they said they would have had something of a &quot; invisible past . &quot;
the report in the magazine &quot; Current Biology &quot; called him as &quot; the be@@ ak @-@ held din@@ osau@@ rs , who has ever found , and one of the best Din@@ osau@@ rs specimens of the world . &quot;
fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredible good preserved condition has researchers to describe it as &quot; really remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the pump@@ ed vegetable f@@ ress@@ er is the best preserved F@@ ossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Radio as he was in Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine at the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine at Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gre@@ b .
he met something that seemed to look at something from the surrounding rocks at the plateau , and decided to look more accurately .
the F@@ ossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) .
after all these hard work the finished result is ready to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you blind only a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chief aut@@ or Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature has to see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is one of the science story as one of the most beautiful and best preserved Din@@ osau@@ rs copies - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers found that this plant is covered , although it is covered with a arm@@ or , probably resem@@ bles of flesh f@@ ress@@ ors din@@ osau@@ rs .
the strongly paved din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide themselves before cra@@ ck , and used a sh@@ iel@@ ding technology that is known as counter@@ f@@ att@@ ing , which is also used by many modern animals .
this could have been allowed to mix well in its surroundings and to soak his enemies , experts , which indicates that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family has made head@@ lines in May and is now visible in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and it was called Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7.000 hours to cover it carefully .
the amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and form of sheds and arm@@ or about his body .
they discovered the con@@ fin@@ ing , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was dark than their under@@ side .
although the cont@@ empl@@ ation is custom@@ ary , the results are sur@@ pris@@ ingly , since the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta exceeds the size of the living animals .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs of sufficient pressure through meat f@@ ress@@ ful Din@@ osau@@ rs has been observed that evolution of the con@@ front@@ ation of the con@@ front@@ ation as a means of survi@@ vor@@ s .
but most of contemporary animals that use the cont@@ am@@ ers - remember R@@ ehe , Zeb@@ ras or belt animals - are a lot of small and viol@@ as for prey , what are sign@@ alized that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; strong Rau@@ b@@ tier behavior on a massive , strongly covered din@@ osau@@ rs , like dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs cat@@ b@@ als of the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous have to have been &quot; said Brown .
chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ rs was red .
scientists continue to examine the animal on information about his life , including his con@@ fin@@ ite gut , to figure out what it did as its last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , was driven into a river and cast into the sea , where he fell on the back to the sea .
at that time Alberta was so warm like South @-@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much more land@@ ward than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it remains complete with cont@@ empl@@ ated skin , but also in three dimensions , remains the original form of the animal . &quot; said Brown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal is almost just as in the early C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use imagination to re@@ construct it . if you only have a little with the eyes , you might believe that he is in sleep . &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous period was time when gigantic ther@@ op@@ odes , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ r that stood on two legs , the earth went through .
although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived million years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the paved din@@ osau@@ rs was ch@@ ased by some of his fur@@ ious ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11,5 m ) long , six tons heavy monsters .
scientists , their latest findings in Current Biology appear , believe that Bo@@ man@@ op@@ el@@ ta has been sunk after the death of the sea in the sl@@ ud@@ ge .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Radio as he died on 21 March 2011 in Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine at Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gre@@ b .
according to the museum , it is the retained din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips from his shoul@@ ders .
the researchers believe that the pump@@ ed vegetable f@@ ress@@ er was sh@@ aken by the western Canada until a floo@@ ded river was floo@@ ded into the open sea .
but the sub@@ tle of the din@@ osau@@ rs preserved his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the remains of this special specimen are so good that the skin @-@ cal@@ ators still cover a pri@@ x tank plates along the din@@ osau@@ rs .
as Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is so rare as a gain in lot@@ tery .
the more I see it , the more conf@@ using it .
decor@@ ate the skin and still cover the hol@@ iness of the skin , which bear the skull of the animal .
his right foot is on his side , its five fingers up to the top .
I can count the sheds on its sole . &quot;
in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ tic@@ le@@ age on A8 : many injured
severe accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ tic@@ le@@ age .
there are numerous injured , mat@@ s long standing and g@@ aff@@ er .
on the Autobahn Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , approximately 20 people have been injured in the late Thursday afternoon at a mass ar@@ tic@@ le@@ age .
according to the first information of the police , at 17.00 o &apos;clock , between the connection offices of the A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg district ) , there were almost 30 vehicles , including lor@@ ries , including lor@@ ry .
there were no information about the exact number of the injured people .
it was a slight rise to moderate injuries , said one police action .
a large donation to rescue vehicles was at the point of accident .
the A8 was completely locked towards Munich .
in the direction of Munich , a distance of around ten kilometres was made of retreat .
like a AZ repor@@ ter , it was also on the counter@@ way to massive disabilities - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire brig@@ ade not@@ ted the signs of the vehicle hand@@ leb@@ ars who now have to count with sensitive offen@@ ders .
shortly after 18 : 45 , there was still a second accident on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
it was a coll@@ ision between a car sports car and a car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : Group test@@ et &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it &apos;s a moment that almost everyone has experienced : nothing really sits in the train and sleeps .
or man is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant thoughts .
and then : buff@@ alo .
comes the Schaff@@ ner and we@@ ars an uns@@ ure , or ri@@ ve the driving force in the middle of the workflow .
ticket contact control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are past soon .
the Deutsche Bahn test currently the purchase @-@ free chassis control .
it is just confirmed by mobile phone that you have taken its place and evalu@@ ates the ticket .
currently , a test operation runs on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes the offer , wide we do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is expected to be available in Germany at the beginning of the year to many more remote tours in Germany , &quot; said a train speaker .
&quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; is called the train @-@ ticket recovery without Schaff@@ ner .
in order to get the use , however , some conditions need to be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to booked a online ticket - what you should do most passengers already .
it is also necessary to have purchased the DB Navigator app , which is why the most comfortable type of ticket booking is .
and last one needs a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works : one rises in the train , calls his ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the test seconds a button will then appear to electronic validation .
the train atten@@ dant can get a message that passenger car is located in the train and the booked seat is Y .
when the driver control comes in place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with a previously un@@ paid online ticket .
you can continue to sleep , continue working , further silent .
&quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the railway - which is to use the passengers .
&quot; those who wish to travel through our train personnel must be checked , check in the DB navig@@ ator easily .
this enables passengers to make your travel time in the train personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Management of DB district traffic .
second Plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to go to the individual customer requirements . &quot;
those who walks often , knows that in addition to del@@ ays and missed the cards of the cards are among the largest off@@ ences .
for often , in any case , in any case , one of the included not all documents you need to use online tickets .
either lack the credit card or personal identity card or otherwise a document needed .
the episode are endless discussions between train managers and passenger , which leads to worse mood in the ab@@ yss or major room and del@@ ays at the end of the time , and will take care of others in order to take care of others .
only a small number of test customers use the new service .
and it can also be found at the ICE ICE 915 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further access numbers on the same route are not un@@ locked .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Britt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sh@@ aken up to their core .
just one day after they arrived in New York City , sitting in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b flat that they rented and sc@@ roll@@ out through Facebook on their phone .
she stum@@ bled on a mail of someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed a 18 year old child , and there is still on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was called it there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
conf@@ using , since no one was posted on their feed the information , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah is constantly prayed to their tim@@ eline .
the Rap@@ per from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an unknown black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white police officers in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed , live .
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns le@@ bl@@ os@@ em body , which was stretched out on the street and stay there for four hours .
&quot; this is wild , &quot; thought Fer@@ rel@@ l in itself .
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
you put on your mobile phone in order to get back later on the evening at Twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field Drive .
there were photos of police band and people , who claimed , and from a man who claimed to be a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police killed just my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
they observed a live feed , with which a polic@@ y@@ ho@@ ist stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bell@@ hop dog .
in another video , she said , it secured another police station , and he cried , saying , &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rec@@ alled by Fer@@ rel@@ l &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder , we are acc@@ ust@@ omed to us and we are able to call . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this moment I felt d@@ g@@ ard .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
you booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two will drive on the next morning after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary movie , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; , in the cinem@@ as from 11 .
it is a story of lively and Protest@@ ants , love and power , the strength and resistance force , which consists of the point of view of people who live in the community and to ask the streets to ask answers .
when Fer@@ rel@@ l had her daughter , which brought a flower @-@ dress , and a matching crown , carried out after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation which they had countless times before this morning &quot; on the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight against them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he remembered her that she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 year old boy , and that was not right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not take it , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later .
&quot; that is what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
you have to know and see it and pulled it in it .
it has to be well developed , not only acti@@ vis@@ m and organization , but also know the various layers of the black experience and the black Constitution and what we must do to free to free ourselves .
even if I have good luck to give you an experience , in which they don &apos;t have experienced rac@@ ism , it is not different than the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have the feeling I would have a bad service to keep them far away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which was waiting for a camp , when the activ@@ ist was waiting for the possible non @-@ acc@@ us@@ ation of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
in there , Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined together with a local owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags before and helped to pass on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly Start@@ ing a new kind of acti@@ vis@@ m for fer@@ rel@@ l shape .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my acti@@ vis@@ m has changed after 9 August , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Student N@@ Course Association , focused on eating justice and health ine@@ qualities in black municipalities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has come all . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rel@@ l arrived at the evening demonstration of Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film director of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a question was Fer@@ rel@@ l in the sense : &quot; will you document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
this sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often from the White - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and resistance .
like Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; we heard that people who had born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised up their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , a artist from the field , who is known for his acti@@ vis@@ m around death of death .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rel@@ l the project closer together with six other nati@@ ves , the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me as these people are represented , because I will be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Fer@@ re@@ ll@@ s experience - to show that it is not a Christ guide , but in order to come together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - they proved itself as the most obvious participant in the film .
follow these show documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; sur@@ pris@@ ingly personal aspects of Fer@@ re@@ ll@@ s Life , as she loves himself and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , and laugh@@ ed , when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the case of human beings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ re@@ ll@@ s &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of the black sw@@ ans women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves Movement .
in 2012 , two of the three fo@@ unders of movement , which have marked the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in the year 2012 , identified the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as a g@@ ay .
&quot; black , pregnant women in man@@ ag@@ erial positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; and therefore we are strug@@ gling to various fron@@ ts .
black , pregnant women have to wear the main load of all . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an voted to notice that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement really held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it is insi@@ sted that &quot; this is not the &quot; m@@ ative type of action , &quot; at the distance of their identity was selected as the heart of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who ra@@ ged this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no co@@ incidence , although it was in front of the front , because in a life of these clo@@ aks as a black , pregnant woman is so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile , the t@@ elecommunications eras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on has long disappeared , but the r@@ ass@@ ical connections between the congregation and the police continue .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years due to the blocking of a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the social and atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
nevertheless she kl@@ ash them to a voice and she feels like this memory , since then she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on on the road three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love one another .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; up to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; size &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : TV readers discuss a bit gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bit gallery moves the people , even though it is not built for long .
but the idea of a shopping centre on the south of the pedestrian area has been ob@@ sol@@ ete since the first presentation in 2009 , the population in fears and opponents .
the topic is hardly a cold .
also on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; the subject is discussed .
while the one can say to a bit gallery : &quot; this would be a dream &quot; ( Nicole Becker ) or &quot; that would be real @-@ class &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; does not need a man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ aking ) or quite simple : &quot; don &apos;t need ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while the fears pointed out to build a gallery more customers in the city , the other shops are benef@@ iting , fear the opponents , that then the pedestrian zone should be bl@@ otted out .
added : the gallery is planned in the property , on which the farm@@ market hall is located in the 13 direct market @-@ mark@@ eted products .
the construction work will be at the end of the construction .
the gallery M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and in Bed@@ a Square , with possibility of sitting outside .
Simone rooms : &quot; we have been buying almost weekly in the pe@@ asant market for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of Land@@ s always felt very happy .
we have also discovered the but@@ cher for us .
we would like that , during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct mark@@ eted in a market hall in the gallery is coming to the amount of rent .
this is likely to be low in the new project . &quot;
Eva Kil@@ ic : &quot; what shopping cart is in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , foot@@ wear , or supermarkets : I find the super@@ flu@@ ous .
there is already enough in our town .
you can see how many stores are empty here - some since months and years .
since there is not even a weekly market place here , it is so important that at least will receive us at least the market hall .
because all this product is offered there , it is mainly offered directly from the producer and is ob@@ serving .
as one can see , loads shops in a shopping centre will be rented only by larger firms , because the holiday rentals are often not portable for retailers .
too bad , special transactions are almost no longer and what else is left , will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall fits me not together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the pe@@ asant market during construction time ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming .
or does it manage to drive the @-@ bit gallery before to drive all shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this will not work .
and shopping center , which is empty , does not need any one .
in my view , it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery .
but for a pe@@ asant market , it is thanks to the mad many - how I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess building projects in Bit@@ burg no place more .
when the pe@@ asant market is stopped , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
an appropriate simil@@ arity : artist makes portraits of Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the room of Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are visible - white , black and brown , which hang almost un@@ not@@ ice@@ ably - that hang about cables of the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ side and hair@@ dresser , which were sent by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent a 35 @-@ year prison sentence from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former intelligence service analy@@ tics posted a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after they set diplomatic missions on the web site of the Le@@ aks .
the new exhibition opened on 2 August is A Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance ( One matching simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was converted into their specialized expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ gression and the proph@@ sid@@ y , whose convic@@ tion was converted by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his position .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA that could look like anyone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data , a sharp if also some intellectual comment could not only be the formation of DNA data - the many ways as they can interpre@@ t and the in@@ har@@ der Det@@ er@@ min@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations - but also to the identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born when Brad@@ ley Edward was born , but had already been spoken since their Pu@@ ber@@ ty over the identification as a woman , was convicted in 2013 for 20 charges , including six viol@@ ets against the sp@@ y law , computer was and theft .
by the prison , her picture was supp@@ ressed , so very that there was only one photo - a grain size , black @-@ white be@@ f@@ ie , sitting in the man@@ ing and a plat@@ bl@@ onde cast - with which it was associated .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg returned from the great success of their 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
it produced the artist portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette lighter and chew@@ ing g@@ um , making the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of which these people could look like .
that was the time that she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg with a press review of the new exhibition .
and she could not visit this time , and could not be photograph@@ ed at this time , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked them whether they wanted to make a DNA portrait .
in the course of two years , the artist and her imprisoned M@@ use were carried out by several letters in the course of two years .
they even illustrated one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ liers Images , &quot; which would lead a future , in which the President Chel@@ es would be able to see it personally .
that Obama had actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ings was asking after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome type of happy additives .
there is also a time at the opening of the exhibition &apos;s something deep and Star@@ kes , since Donald Tr@@ ump takes a war against in@@ forman@@ t from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et ways to meet the rigid sp@@ ades , which he should recover , continue to escape .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked after the strange timing of all these things , she told that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in a close to the gallery of the gallery , he called for Mann@@ ing with its over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name ) an end of &quot; automatic disin@@ teg@@ ration , whose foundation is gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ ler of Cs and Gs and As described in graphite .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hop@@ ed to show the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nu@@ cle@@ ot@@ ide after the highly developed scientific Lex@@ icon of the artist ) as amazing , at least in biological resp@@ ects , we all are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what people hop@@ efully will take care of what we are and how open genetic data for a interpretation and how sub@@ jective them are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous memories is also visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell as many different stories , hence the 30 of these stories . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition which is kept in an own room is a site from the above @-@ mentioned com@@ ic nov@@ elle .
she shows Mann@@ ing , as described in a hands @-@ free spins in the United States of the United States as King @-@ Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they have ch@@ ill your words , then they won . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; so never know the mouth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter which she wrote me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ et from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m still alive when I speak about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not yet seen the exhibition - as it is predic@@ tive in the com@@ ic book - but when it should do it , then it will be greeted in the middle of the room of the m@@ asks , by their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ations that are joined as hor@@ des of protest .
that was even targeted , as all in the exhibition , until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ ature ) , where their genetic h@@ ap@@ log@@ groups were written with a pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , I had them on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a human being &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg said by the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind their liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford for killing
a nationwide human hunting is in G@@ ange for a professor at North@@ western University and a employee of the University of Oxford who had been considered susp@@ ects after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with dead@@ ly injuries .
on Monday the arrest warrant for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts were exhibited because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , like the acts of the Local Court of Cook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several bul@@ ls .
a Community warning system published by the Police Authority of Chicago , that Lei@@ che was discovered on 27 July .
civil servants received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared on the site of the event for dead , and Det@@ ectives examine the stit@@ ches as murder while the police actively seeks to the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
L@@ ath@@ em has been a special Professor for Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the Vice @-@ President for University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that L@@ ath@@ em is now being ur@@ rec@@ ated and excluded from the centre of the North@@ western University campus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a criminal matter which is examined by the competent authorities , and the North@@ western University co@@ operates at this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is a Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
a spokes@@ man at the University and the Som@@ erville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in Great Britain and are ready to help the U.S. investig@@ ative authorities to assist in any manner . &quot;
the statement added that war@@ r@@ ens colleagues were sho@@ cked and want to set themselves .
chief Communications Officer of Chicago , Anthony Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi , said he had challenging the susp@@ ects the susp@@ ects to the authorities .
&quot; the police have a presentation of her residence , and our efforts to loc@@ alize them , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find susp@@ ects .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand @-@ Plaza building that has just received an av@@ ailed tip that has just happened in apartment 1008 .
the police described the scene as a very cruel treatment .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that it was un@@ clear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victims had a relationship , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi .
the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation on residents : &quot; the police currently works on the tim@@ eline and the background of the sacrifice and explo@@ red a variety of moti@@ ves , including a possible domestic pre@@ ferences . &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road map in the near future &quot; - Russian Vi@@ zep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
Russian Vi@@ zep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said , it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of satis@@ fying the criteria of the road , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK anti @-@ d@@ oping ) .
the WA@@ DA driver has been updated in this regard , &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented on the second leg of the WA@@ DA to comply with the code which describes the criteria for re@@ integration of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain any thing for Russia &apos;s reason to concern himself .
&quot; everything was announced , everything is implemented .
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added .
one of the criteria mentioned in the list indicates that the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities det@@ ects the reported results from the WA@@ DA approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to accept state @-@ sponsored d@@ op@@ ings in Russian sport .
in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we lead the investigation because our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has an error .
all measures have been implemented .
but there was no state programmes , and we don &apos;t want to ad@@ mit what does not exist . &quot;
mut@@ il@@ os words voted with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping Commission , agreed .
in conversation with the Russian Sales stelle R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report um@@ str@@ ated positions and regulations .
no one has to accept this report un@@ conditional , &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v .
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the course of d@@ oping sc@@ and@@ als from the WA@@ DA by the implementation of D@@ op@@ ing@@ checks in Russia .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and UK anti @-@ d@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the main quarters of the organisation in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ General@@ director Olivier Nig@@ gli explained that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has moved &quot; into the right direction &quot; to be used .
Al@@ di sells no eggs just before
they distributed the corporate groups .
there is a pure precau@@ tionary measure , it could be gone out of no health impair@@ ment , it is called in the notification .
from now on , only eggs are supplied to Al@@ di , they have been tested negative on fi@@ ref@@ il@@ ous anti @-@ slip cases .
Al@@ di would therefore produce clarity and transparency about his customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company will not go to the next u@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure your staff at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised an@@ onym@@ ity , some workers do not mourn the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectiv@@ ity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t who operates 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Society Madison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has called people from the outside .
a new breed of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at Wach@@ sen to help companies to find out how their employees feel at home .
through the creation and licens@@ ing of software which provide the specific purpose of measurement of employees , enabling companies to deal with surveys , speci@@ als and demo@@ graphic groups , allowing us to deal with speci@@ ality groups and demo@@ graphic groups in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ n to turn the C @-@ suite exec@@ u@@ tives to turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you are now tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics of companies is used to measure employees .
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she has a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
in addition to the Sn@@ ap @-@ surveys and surveys of certain teams , it provides a heat card of the company that shows the most complaints and which exec@@ u@@ tives have low condition results - so that you can drill up , why .
the company is coming to see that at the top of the workplace culture , you will not have been involved in sc@@ and@@ als , which has been published in Sk@@ and@@ als since then a former employee , which describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment , with those who have spoken to be punished .
for Start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of a more lu@@ cr@@ ative business option .
the Global Governance , Regulation and Compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion worth , according to the financing technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Denver , Colorado , start @-@ up convertible , the company helps to prevent bad behaviour and to recogn@@ ise , saw a rising interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ k@@ re@@ dit .
Conver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla .
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client@@ ele .
like G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ cent Companies tail@@ ored &quot; Pul@@ s- &quot; surveys , confi@@ dential answers in real time and view the warmth maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hotline which can report personal behavior .
and when the chief executive guide is entered , complaints directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has recorded the reg@@ ul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company is found that its staff is po@@ or@@ ly treated or un@@ eth@@ ical , it may experience co@@ stly consequences by consumers @-@ boy@@ cott , worker flu@@ k@@ tu@@ ation and se@@ agen , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , Conver@@ ted for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures , and a simple way to have their corporate headquarters .
earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he had to submit a telephone number or email to the corporate headquarters , a formal appeal , and hope that he was harvest@@ ed .
it was often an en@@ roll@@ ment and un@@ comfortable experience , James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ Y@@ S General Coun@@ sel , said , there was no good opportunity to follow the complaints of employees .
well , since the company Conver@@ ted , you can have problems that were previously identified by exec@@ u@@ tives that were in offices in cities or countries , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or ir@@ cl@@ ut@@ ational inter@@ ns , identified and addressed .
&quot; I can be closer to this holi@@ stic , 360 degree view over the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who runs the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders before employment and disp@@ utes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take eth@@ ics , values and employee engagement in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of eth@@ ical violations of the En@@ ron Sk@@ and@@ al , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
but it took , until the &quot; Social Media came to their right , &quot; knowing that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online .
&quot; before use of technology for monitoring eth@@ ics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service and loaded the company with recur@@ ring fees for use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of Venture Capital investors who have both start @-@ ups .
Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , where the total capital was raised to $ 47 million .
Gl@@ itz@@ inger secured $ 10 million in November by Bess@@ emer Partners and brought his entire funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising , in view of the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex on research , that shows that today &apos;s employees expect over their jobs more than before .
in competitive markets such as Sil@@ icon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only .
the employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated that you will give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if people are happy to be able to do their voices , and that the work that you will do , then you will feel stronger to make this company successfully , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and W@@ ye@@ e Experience in Link@@ ed@@ In , both Conver@@ cent as well as G@@ lin@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors can reach R@@ end@@ ums , when their portfolio companies are well running . companies run well when employees are going to use and committed .
if the Analytics tools speak to third parties , commitment and use of employees , it is not surprising that you find support .
the data on employees &apos;s commitment to the experts of workplace culture is important .
but the data are us@@ eless if the administrator of a company does not take action .
in fact , if a company asks for your feedback , it may have a expect@@ ation that is on the way .
and if the shift doesn &apos;t come fast enough , or not , this dis@@ appoint@@ ments can become ir@@ dis@@ appoint@@ ments and employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be willing to have 4,000 talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company to have left the collection of collecting data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you take care of it ?
and who did not worry about why should I ? &quot;
Madison Re@@ ed , who has now been able to en@@ quire at the same day , was able to run measures in the same day if a problem is reported on G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ ret@@ t .
and after collecting the feedback of fru@@ str@@ ated employees , it was able to organise new teams within the business and to add several teams within the company and to add a communication training to tackle the problems .
Ruby Tuesday receives the company always new in@@ sights on employees , and it hopes that on long sight , this leads to better management of workers in a sector , which is well @-@ known for high revenues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose humans , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and if you lose humans , you will also lose customers .
and if you lose customers then you will lose companies .
the N@@ CAA remov@@ es the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Bru@@ ins
it goes on 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A foot@@ ball@@ players on one side of the new exercise fields of the team is enter@@ tain@@ ed .
some have pulled off their tri@@ ps and show the back full of swe@@ at from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team this invol@@ ve a lunch break .
players who are written in the summer courses are returning after the three hour exercise , before they return on the next morning at 6 : 30 am to the Aquari@@ an Football Center .
&quot; that is for the guys the next three days a real T@@ ret@@ mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday was on Tuesday .
the N@@ CAA elim@@ in@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of players , and she has actually prolonged her days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore the first three trainings of the U@@ CL@@ A should begin at 19 : 15 o &apos;clock in order to meet the already fully packed periods of players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than one day when the brood was post@@ pon@@ ed for almost one week after the last season , and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as , during the summer school during Mor@@ as six game times in West@@ wood .
they will keep 18 exercises during the course of August . 20 before the beginning of formal playing preparations for their pre@@ lu@@ de against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he under@@ line the control change of the N@@ CAA support , even if they add a further point to the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous load on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they have pressed it , they pl@@ agu@@ ed , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really great . &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will termin@@ ate its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which was rejected in view of the clear visibility of its fields by a adjacent parking and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel which is already covered with foot@@ steps , which will be a protective network behind a door@@ posts , no easy task will be .
Bru@@ ins are supposed to occupy the hotel from that weekend , but Mor@@ a dream that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far to think that people can rent there a room and then set up a practice there to draw a exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video and exercise from a practice , it &apos;s a pretty good business .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces to parking place 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I &apos;m not doing too big worry about it .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false report from third parties and their results in the original contribution , this is the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to combat so called f@@ ake news .
the company said in a statement on his site that it will begin with the use of updated mechanical learning methods to detect possible detection applications and show them to fact that possibly show results of the fact test from the original article .
Facebook was critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so called f@@ ake news , of which many believed that they also have influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 .
the problem is also in Europe to become a major political topic , whereby the French elec@@ tors were floo@@ ded in May with false stories , and Germany does not support a plan to eliminate the social media networks as before the elections in September quickly .
on Thursday Facebook in a separate explanation on Thursday said Facebook in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts review will be launched .
&quot; in addition to the knowledge that stories of fact ex@@ presses by the third parties want people more context to make sure what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , product man@@ ag@@ erin for Facebook news in a blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook continues to continue to test the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related Articles &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in conjunction with other changes to his news feed to reduce wrong messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
create a com@@ ic novel : a castle in history of England
in his younger past , the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squ@@ e@@ eze music video and was a sle@@ e@@ ager for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 @-@ s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of tur@@ bul@@ ent history of his cozy seat in the valley of K@@ ent and now is now for inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ ari@@ gen Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so beautiful to see the manuscript from someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says we@@ aken . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England called for the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another British artist , Isaac hand@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , which is based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection which was inspired by documents in British Library - a project which he un@@ expect@@ edly found .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only responded to the thum@@ b pressure on the page of a letter that was written by a double agents in the 1700 &apos;s years , who worked for the Jac@@ o@@ bin@@ s , &quot; says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that is his thum@@ b pressure !
and letters still smell upon smoke , for at that time a fire was kindled because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the od@@ our has a effect as he himself would also be .
Oh , I love Archive ! &quot;
for someone who is so appe@@ aled with old papers that he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England , and almost four months in a lock ( &quot; To be hon@@ est : I have told my welcome drink . ) it seems to be all too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days to explore the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , to study the archives and to study many treasures and cur@@ ios@@ ities of the castle , such as the mon@@ te hy@@ än@@ n@@ heads on walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the grave .
he walked through the area and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with land @-@ fle@@ eing , mer@@ chandise and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he drank &quot; whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust was only received in 2006 when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died .
when Rho@@ des arrived one decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive , which he said as &quot; hundreds of years , in which Arist@@ ok@@ rates said &quot; Oh , it described it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Em@@ pi@@ res , maps , which meant : &quot; it could be that land conflicts would be bor@@ ing , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight for two families .
guys , let &apos;s go all his ais@@ le ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to come on a wider base in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which leaves the newly built castle in order to join the pe@@ asant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a record of an u@@ pro@@ ar who occurred in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book with the title &apos; Kn@@ igh@@ tly Famil@@ ies of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rho@@ des . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pe@@ asant revol@@ ved in this area and I thought , an uprising was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the two are connected with each other ? &quot;
other stories are firmly ro@@ oted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , the history of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ern@@ ers who hid the family of Dar@@ rel@@ l seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The Sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers &apos; , in which the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l is presented in the 18th century by taking his own fun@@ eral by having filled a sar@@ g with stones ( a discovery which was first dug only years later ) .
the Dar@@ re@@ ll@@ s are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the lor@@ ds of Shi@@ ps is to be able to make debts and money for things which they could not aff@@ ord .
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l men sol@@ ving their debt crisis by taking the rich old women married - I set her as a he@@ ap well @-@ looking boys with a talent in order to be land@@ locked . &quot;
after the end of his use in the castle , Rho@@ des on searching for other unique write experiences
he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wild for a com@@ ic novel about El@@ ges , the area of a san@@ atorium dating back to the early 20th century , which has been re@@ claimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to be ready again with the dam@@ n life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ bin &apos;s chapel covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the deep@@ ening of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ att@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the City of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f has launched its campaign for introducing a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) .
until Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team will hold the logo and the slogan .
at the end of August it will be a highlight of the campaign a celebration on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
or ? , &quot; the makers of the action have been on posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer Chapel since yesterday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really think of course ! ) do not really , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; write them on their yesterday &apos;s website . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; it is considered to form@@ ulate a stand@@ alone promise , one that gives the city an un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able private property . &quot;
finally they get in the contest with other municipalities .
a medium @-@ digit amount can be paid by the City of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f their new umbrella brand and the campaign costs .
military re@@ forms in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ ans afraid of the army
every year at the beginning of August in Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) served on pension funds and supporters in the army cor@@ ps .
this week is as well .
at first glance , a normal operation .
but nothing is routine in the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting took place no longer in the building of the General Staff , as previously , but during the official headquarters of the Prime Minister .
under the presi@@ dency of the government , the five Vi@@ eil@@ re@@ mier@@ s and the Minister of Defense , the Minister of Defence , and Foreign Affairs , took part in the presi@@ dency .
thus the civilians were killed in the number of numbers .
the government moves the re@@ ins in the military .
Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the Air Force , and the Navy were removed .
since the failed cou@@ p , State Court has fired 169 of 326 gener@@ als and ad@@ mir@@ als .
over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile @-@ Pre@@ dig@@ nity Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , sees the Erd@@ og@@ an as a wire suspension of the coup .
for 486 people who have been involved in the coup attempt to have been involved in Ankara since this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erd@@ og@@ an had called the overthrow of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worship &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he would give him the opportunity to clean the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but has Erd@@ og@@ an the army really in the handle ?
at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet published an article with the heading &quot; Im@@ mediate in the military headquarters . &quot;
in general , there is a concern for an increasing &quot; Islam@@ izing &quot; of the Army , which manifested themselves in the repe@@ al of the case for Sol@@ dier , wrote the newspaper .
in any case , the large puri@@ fication of the army and the security forces goes on .
in mid @-@ July , Erd@@ og@@ an ordered a further 73@@ 95 Heads of State , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 546 soldiers .
it seemed to be nar@@ rator into the military .
gener@@ als former as the real gent@@ l@@ emen of the country .
three times laid down on appeal to their role as gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the world@@ ly State Order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erd@@ og@@ an ur@@ ged the power of the military step by step , not least on appeal to the reform of the European Union .
former officers say , Erd@@ og@@ an , having targeted targeted a Islam@@ ist of forces .
in the magazine &quot; Voc@@ al Europe &quot; , a well @-@ called officer , who , after the coup attempt was afraid of persecution from persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extrem@@ ists and sal@@ es@@ ists in a few years . &quot;
that is true , such a development could not allow NATO .
there is no doubt in the Alliance according to the cleans@@ ing of the Turkish army .
NATO exec@@ u@@ tives and operation capabilities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; says Nato diplom@@ ats .
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immig@@ ration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted from the media .
he considers to lower legitim@@ ate immig@@ rants to 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter regulations for obtain@@ ing visa for temporary work permit and restrictions on families @-@ oriented visa .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ can and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increases wages and billion dollars for the tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do this by changing the United States by the United States , such as the citizens from other countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the migration migration and replace the current system .
this new applic@@ ant procedure will help the candidate who have the financial resources to support themselves and knowledge of our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted from the American media .
Ministry wants to san@@ e track for race transportation
again , over the past months , over the future of the race track was disp@@ uted - now it is supposed to go quickly .
before the end of the year it should be built on the mar@@ vel route , on which the travel dates can be built .
in order to safegu@@ ard the future of the racing section for the long term , according to information from the Ministry of Finance , construction work will start in the course of this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order the route of Ilmenau @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country knows mainly for tourism important connection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared traffic state Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the maintenance of the route has been estimated at approx . 2.5 million euros .
from this sum up the country take 75 percent .
the contract , on whose basis the shuttle is to be ordered in the future of the country , will definitely be voted , declared S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the southern ür@@ n@@ ingen railway will be established as an operator about the technical details .
&quot; thus , the road@@ map used for vehicles and quality standards are tra@@ ded , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l .
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
the racing shuttle can be ordered regular by the racing bike on December 2017 .
the racing bike shuttle is an especially popular railway link between the stations of Ilmenau and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
in the past few months , in the course of a pilot operation , the distance of plenty of people is used to order their regular service in the future .
the route is also strongly di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated in parts .
the Rise of Sex Ro@@ bots is real , and we should worry about it
just as you thought it is not yet crazy , there is a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are currently a great thing .
recently , the Foundation issued for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Ro@@ bot ) ( FR@@ R ) , a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , emer@@ itus professor for rob@@ ot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we need to start their ascent .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , choose its form of ni@@ pp@@ le and type of fing@@ ern@@ a@@ gel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people make a fun , but the company deliver lots of them , and we will see them too much more common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Shar@@ key in the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone fo@@ res@@ kin that feels warm - with deliber@@ ately human reaction that can be achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also custom@@ ize its robot according to his belie@@ fs , &quot; and then choose everything , from the eye color of the robot about the form of ni@@ pp@@ le to the type or color of his fing@@ ern@@ ails .
but there will be even more wor@@ sen@@ ing because many robots have the &quot; personal@@ ities &quot; which would look like a Step@@ ford @-@ Ms. progressive .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have evolved to robots with a silicone fo@@ res@@ kin .
the real B@@ oti@@ x robot allows for example to adapt its users to adapt their robots to the properties that is appe@@ aling as ti@@ ghtness .
and then there is still the ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot with pre @-@ programmed personal@@ ities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of rel@@ ent@@ ity and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality who is adapted as good as possible , &quot; sh@@ ielded the website of True Compan@@ ion .
so they like what you like , and they don &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day their voc@@ ations - very how real people !
she can be tired , fixed on conversation , or it can be &quot; in mood . &quot;
there are many be@@ ati@@ fying aspects in this ascent of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ jug@@ ated female properties that concerns a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( is here : resist@@ ible ) Far@@ rah is un@@ quiet one most .
on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibration but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a vibration , why can men do not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it is called on the website .
however , this sex robot is not just a fat or am@@ bush just another sex lighter .
her emergence and its increasing refin@@ ement show a slightly dar@@ ker and deep@@ est in our culture , to retreat from the Ideal of Gender equality to a wish after sex with sub@@ jug@@ ation as an optional enc@@ ore .
most men will make no sex robots , while the FR@@ R noticed their increasing popularity , they still remain temporary on the edge of consumer culture .
but what things out of the bound@@ ary zones can be le@@ ak@@ ened in terms of the spirit of time , in which we live , very instru@@ ctive .
and many people are not stran@@ gely enough , but the free market for these are permission .
there is a certain reas@@ oning that this highly developed sex robots are threatened with a time in which the rights of women are threatened by women in which there have a pre@@ sidents who made women sexual violence in the White House .
the most horri@@ fying aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the handmaid &apos; ) are not the graphic pictures , the closed body and the cast eyes , but how realistic this vision seems .
the republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment do not feel like a big jump .
the goal behind this sex robots exists , a physical simil@@ arity to real women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with por@@ no@@ star propor@@ tions ) .
their builders refused to feel human body that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , on the point , when it comes to their &quot; personal@@ ities , &quot; the robot represent no real women .
they cannot separate or simply go away by their companion .
they don &apos;t have a medi@@ ation or a background history , nothing , something on independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total failure .
different to use : you are counter@@ f@@ ake slaves .
or to express it in the mode of 2017 : utilities
Tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the appearance of healthy human understanding
it is become a B@@ ins@@ ular era of the Tr@@ ump era , that the political circuits that have dealt the US voters even families in small @-@ format .
around Christmas and Ern@@ t@@ ed@@ ank@@ fest there were newspapers in the USA and deal with advice regarding the face of Tr@@ ump @-@ Tr@@ ump &apos;s hor@@ ror .
we meet all supp@@ os@@ edly , to leave our filter bub@@ bles .
in less then , the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps , families have been merged .
I chose this , because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ focused di@@ chter@@ in which lives in Chicago and has long attended with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
she remin@@ ded me that the unit can have a mighty enemy against a common enemy .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows it , including Republi@@ can transformation , with which they had fought for decades , suddenly and completely independent on the same side .
in order to ensure the dining table , this certainly is a good thing , but it falls in a further context that this also brings significant risks with themselves .
the left hand was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the effective effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all to the right .
if we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ us@@ el@@ ly option that our k@@ itt@@ ens will not stum@@ ble for one day .
there is however an even more terri@@ fying long @-@ time scenario , in which Tr@@ ump Rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the Right wing &quot; norm@@ alizes &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison with his standards as in@@ gest@@ ion of failure .
I found myself from an active nost@@ al@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ rec@@ ess version of the back then - the dog on the car body , which saw 14 % revenue tax ( but at least did we know how his tax statement ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact a very mild criminal off@@ ences .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be spiritual healthy , to qualify as an un@@ meas@@ ur@@ able improvement .
when my c@@ ousin in the city was , we brought our children to Kar@@ us@@ sell in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sel &apos;s car park , and the best three dollars which one can spend in the city if you are no caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass design on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cris@@ y and the animals are turned to watch over their own shoul@@ ders - extremely fin@@ ster and the climate of music will be convey@@ ed in a notable way .
so many cl@@ ashes of a city disappointed : the views of high buildings are old , the Sky@@ lines are familiar to provide a lot of exc@@ itement , and the reality of the city will not be justified .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not completely over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the Top@@ ic Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not one - but a big roundabout in the North London .
the Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magical experience , since there are two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s and all have a great time .
if I would have been able to rate the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given to him the full score , but fortunately , nobody has asked after that .
on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance an average of 15 % tip - this to buy something about the shop .
this does not lead to a slow@@ down of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also pract@@ ised pressure on the server to bring it into a situation where no required is required .
the poor woman in the department store was bl@@ ending , while I tired the experience I made my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain from the prison in the hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital for the second time .
in the past year , he was brought to the hospital for the treatment of snap@@ shots , according to the prison authorities , according to a fall in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was convicted of murder of the prosec@@ uting attor@@ neys for murder of appeal against an appeal .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in early morning hours of Valentine &apos;s early hours by calling them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ t@@ oria on it .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he kept his gir@@ l@@ friend for a n@@ igh@@ ter penetration that hidden himself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ uting attor@@ neys have announced their intention , this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of whom they say they are op@@ aque .
the National Prosec@@ ution Agency said that they shall rise in the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the obj@@ ection could be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us runs danger that his sentence is increased to 15 years when the prosec@@ uting attor@@ neys are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .

software update for diesel vehicles : what will need to know now
how accurate is the software update ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group software updates for a total of approximately 5.3 million cars are offered .
they are supposed to improve the emission behaviour of cars of emission classes Euro 5 and partially Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin by the ACE Auto Club Europe gives ass@@ ess@@ ments :
is the new action oblig@@ atory ?
no , the negoti@@ ated software updates are voluntary .
&quot; the oblig@@ atory updates are only valid for vehicles that have Schumann &apos;s Software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin .
its re@@ arm@@ ament has ordered the power drive of the Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customer be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have yet announced a close implementation during the next months , but still no precise date .
Daimler has communic@@ ated to write any data subject .
if not a inspection is due , that will be done within the frame .
how long will the change f@@ ails to go altogether ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; S@@ met@@ anin count .
the hang@@ ings of the producers of producers as well as from the political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen that the car manufacturer claims not so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the conversion itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
time difference could be to get an appointment .
what do motor@@ ists do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE is waiting for .
probably foreign manufacturers would im@@ itate , so S@@ met@@ anin .
is there a massive price @-@ fall of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears that .
but now in the regions where fare is threatened .
in rural areas there is no impair@@ ments for older diesel engines .
the ACE is av@@ eng@@ ed with a sale yet .

we make the city life
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ hab@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes to the next year in R@@ ente .
however , the place is already written - suitable applic@@ ants are ra@@ r .
since 31 years W@@ acker is Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
and the work makes him still great fun as he medi@@ ates in the press brie@@ fing .
he reports varied , but also challenging tasks that wait for its successor .
at the same time it ad@@ mi@@ red that so far no application must fulfill the demands profile .
the city is looking for the next possible time a architects or construction engineer .
it is said - under the cont@@ emp@@ t of regular notice - still enough time for an el@@ aboration .
since Has@@ lach was responsible for the administration of the administration authority , applic@@ ants must be relevant to the applic@@ ants .
for this function wants to keep the city definitely .
if they would not be able to fill it anymore , the citizens would have to ride up to Offen@@ burg .
but the proximity of the city and himself is important , W@@ acker who tells of a good operating climate , as well as good mood between the authority and citizens .
more than 30 years in the office have gathered some important projects that the W@@ acker is proud of pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is about the building office and his employees safely . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future there are varied projects in the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the low @-@ scale parking space is about to be infected .
the chin @-@ bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the st@@ adi@@ ation is still subject .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter alone will strike around 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor .
work here is fun . &quot;
rock is present for a city hall of large game room .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s its own building yard and dener can be re@@ flexi@@ bly re@@ acted in versat@@ ility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the design of the green plants are often praised of citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the old town is listed as a member of monuments , it is important to have &quot; an eye for it , &quot; when new buildings are approved , the separ@@ ating Stadt@@ bau@@ meister will be re@@ iter@@ ated .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister holds high responsibility .
he is the builder , &quot; at the end , everything goes on my table here . &quot;
for assistance and coordination he can count on long @-@ standing staff : Markus Neum@@ u@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been doing this for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Low Construction ) has been in existence for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even so that his successor will remain , W@@ acker : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re looking for someone who really identi@@ fies and remain in the job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for continu@@ ity is not only important for a good operating climate , but also for the further design of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; who would like to inherit Roland W@@ acker should have studied architecture as a diploma engineer or Bachelor with Architecture of Architecture , should have good expertise in the fields of construction and planning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stadt@@ bau@@ d under@@ stands high and deep construction , construction planning , under@@ under@@ age planning , administration of urban property , urban@@ isation and municipal office , as well as sub @-@ law firm , including monument protection .
bicycle is thrown on cords : South @-@ rail closed
according to the police , previously unknown k@@ iller had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) .
these were so bad@@ ly damaged that the her@@ b@@ ating goods must be kept .
the investigations go out of two male do@@ ings and search for the night hours after them .
near to Tat@@ ort by witnesses , a thr@@ ott@@ le Roll@@ ers and a bike driver was observed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ anno@@ is rich , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
or the perpet@@ rators have brought themselves in great risk and end@@ anger@@ ed traffic .
besides the damage to the Lo@@ k and the plant as well as the delay @-@ minute and costs for rail traffic , also P@@ ön@@ alen &apos;s customer might continue to reach the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; overall , a total of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the southern slope could be guided without disabilities .
almost ten passenger cars were retired , two of them were involved in correspondence .
freight for@@ ts did not fell , but they had delayed .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ person Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged for about 200 meters of upper lines .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts have also been damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help IB@@ D ( infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel disease )
red meat and chocolate can make your digest@@ ive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , the symptoms of patients with anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel diseases might .
the indisp@@ utable condition that affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States in the United States , causing stomach and bleeding , recur@@ ring or blu@@ ish fail@@ ures , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
during those affected , meat and dairy products usually come to avoid their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an increased by proteins to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant gut .
the senior researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immun@@ cells in the intest@@ ine pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide themselves in the food , not into the body .
cells that are capable of dis@@ able inflamm@@ ations , are balanced by cells , to protect the tolerance and protect the body without sensitive tissue .
if the balance is too far in the direction of inflamm@@ ation , it can result in a infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel disease .
in experiments it was determined that a type of tolerance promoting immun@@ cell in mice that can carry a particular bacter@@ ium in their bow@@ els .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an - one of the stones of proteins - to resolve the appearance of the cells .
Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacter@@ ium - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ osis , and the development of a population of cells that promote the tolerance .
the more tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an the mice in their food , the more had them from these immune cells . &quot;
he proposed that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an rich nutrition toler@@ ant , less infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory intest@@ inal mil@@ ie@@ us promotes when the same system is even in humans .
the post @-@ doctoral degree in Dr. Lu@@ isa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan sought a kind of immune cell when it found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe that had been accommodated but not had .
they suspected that the difference with the intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ osis of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ us , who normally live in the stomach @-@ intest@@ ines .
the mice of the mice were detected DNA sequ@@ enz@@ es and they were found six bacter@@ ets that were present in mice with immune cells , but without they were missing in mice .
mice were moved in a ster@@ ile environment , so that a intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ oma were missing and they did not developed this kind of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria can grow to the immune system , the researchers decided to grow in a liquid and then led small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells that were isolated from mice .
immune cells developed to the tolerance sub@@ marine cells .
when the active component is cleaned from the liquid , it proved to be known as a side @-@ product of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an met@@ abolic , which is known as In@@ do@@ l @-@ 3 @-@ l@@ actic acid .
if the researchers have doubled the amount of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an in the feed of mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 per cent , but when the tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an@@ ism were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same toler@@ ant cells like mice , and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal tra@@ ps .
it is not known whether tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an @-@ side @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an were found in people with anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel disease .
she said : &quot; the development of these cells is probably something that we would have to promote , since these cells control inflamm@@ ation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines .
potentially explosive tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an values can lead to an extension of this population in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i .
Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; gen@@ ius . &quot;
in Manchester United has signed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , believes Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pounds signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre@@ season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday begins , and impressive in the holder &apos;s role , as people as Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira .
however , M@@ atic had been excluded from the Prepar@@ ation @-@ Asia tour of the blues and only managed to improve the Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho in 45 minutes that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in the way , how he th@@ inks of football , &quot; said Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; we will help him to be ready earlier than later . &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic started Victor Lin@@ del@@ a and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u in Avi@@ va Stadium , as Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho his start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
the Independent In@@ ü@@ ll@@ te in this week that Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho loved three more new comm@@ it@@ ments , but it insi@@ sted that the club already made a &quot; fantastic work &quot; to meet three of its four pre @-@ elected new comm@@ it@@ ments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three of four things I thank you to the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they receive four out of four , but they gave great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; painted &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the US aircraft producer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , but the drawing began in the Marqu@@ ette in the U.S. state of Michigan , and moved to the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , that are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
in the radar sh@@ iel@@ ding the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole was a cardio test for new engines .
Boeing had already done such advertising before the end of the country .
so the number &quot; 787 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .
new chair@@ lift for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind is turning : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD boss , S &amp; D Prime Minister President always looked at a certain concern in Berlin .
only any distur@@ ban@@ ces from the Party centre , merely a counter@@ wind out of the covenant - as loud as the most important desire of the election fought .
since Martin Schulz , the party has changed , has changed dramatically .
since then , the employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus with growing h@@ unter the events in the SPD @-@ reg@@ ated state capit@@ als .
what Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year , the counter@@ wind should not be described in the approach .
it were deep envelop@@ es .
and that one after another .
the Federal CDU also looks after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony a general signal against co@@ al@@ itions of SPD and green .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it shows once more : red @-@ green can not be reliable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CDU @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber the editor network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprising fra@@ ction of an Green Party over@@ threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the Parliament election lost its red @-@ green coalition , making their one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
the Green Party Leader Michael Kell@@ ner has called the ab@@ be@@ zel @-@ Sax@@ on Green @-@ member El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to return to her mandate .
the transition to the CDU means a clear f@@ ake of voters .
El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets must immediately return to Mand@@ ate , &quot; said the Federal Leader and Election Figh@@ ting Party Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he sigh@@ ing a SPD election , when on Friday morning the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ Message has reached the party headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Weil , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after crossing the green de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to the CDU without own government majority .
it is the provisional cli@@ max of all the rows of large and small cris@@ es in the SPD state associations .
and no one knows what next comes .
the mis@@ ery began with the un@@ expect@@ edly defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , more , soo@@ thing the com@@ ra@@ des of one time .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
it was then too much worse - it was much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the st@@ roll , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite &apos;s party .
the com@@ ra@@ des joined the com@@ ra@@ des in the weeks after that .
the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg came out of Hamburg when they had just a new courage .
and the next stop was with him .
Mayor O@@ la@@ f Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD , lost his Nim@@ bus in that weekend , because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burned .
and because he did in the crisis communication so pretty everything was wrong , what one can do wrong .
since then Sch@@ olz f@@ ights for his political survival .
now also Stephan Weil .
because of the VW @-@ exhaust aff@@ air and his role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister &apos;s Prime Minister have already been in criticism .
r@@ ese re@@ fra@@ ction were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps straight , because , because in the past few weeks , Weil attempted to set acc@@ ents in the federal state .
the best idea of the former mayor of Hanover , based in Berlin , remained un@@ hidden in the environment of Martin Schulz as well .
they left him , since they pronounced as a stabil@@ ization of the party .
now the exact opposite could occur .
in this case , because there is no fault that is due to the parties of the parties , because there is no fault .
and Schulz didn &apos;t even notice .
sometimes the com@@ ra@@ des tend to keep your own ranks closed .
your wrath is aimed at the gre@@ enery , and here especially on the ab@@ bey par@@ li@@ ament@@ arians in T@@ jack@@ ets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and demo@@ c@@ lical , such as Mr@@ s T@@ jack@@ ets their own career food on the interests of all others &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , Chief of Part@@ n@@ ines in the SPD Bundestag , the editorial network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. T@@ elecommun@@ ication is not responsible for her person as a direct can@@ did@@ acy but by the state @-@ of @-@ Sax@@ on @-@ Sax@@ on @-@ Sax@@ on parliament .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD Bundestag , compl@@ ains a &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters aged four years ago was clear : human beings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan Weil &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who direc@@ ts the Lower Saxony as a top candidate in the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the personal career result of a future CDU , the election result &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he demanded to clari@@ fy the back@@ grounds .
I want to know if there was more or more inter@@ mitt@@ ments of the CDU Lower Saxony has been given .
conveying capacity for centre III
who would like to hear his own house in the years , can also receive assistance from the country .
in addition , Mayor of Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of ste@@ g city development will be held on Wednesday .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler had once again a review of this event .
since 1991 , it has been working in Sens@@ itive san@@ itation areas .
at that time , in the San@@ itary area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the surplus was still at 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; successful project &quot; - it is finally important to promote the inner development and not only close new construction areas .
on April 4 I received information from the government office of Karlsruhe to obtain information that there will be an area of san@@ itation III .
the funding amount is 8@@ 33 333 euros , including some 500 000 Euro from the country , the rest of the church .
how does a sanit@@ ery exist now ?
one will continue to examine so Sch@@ in@@ dler , investigate , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
but it also plays a role whether in the planned territory ever interest , to san@@ e .
if necessary , the area limits may also post@@ p@@ one another .
the Ste@@ g joined the Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; cell@@ ars presented the contents of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; program , which would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
core of the program are the Rev@@ it@@ alization of inner ma@@ ids , improving the residential and working conditions and receipt of infrastructure .
the measures would be covered by means of object , which means :
the sanctuary should eventually be established as a statute .
the approval period for the funding period has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
however , even until September this year the survey will only be carried out once again , in the framework of which they involved a questionnaire to fill out a questionnaire .
in November or December , the sat@@ ary decision should be carried out , thus next year with the renov@@ ations can be started .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that each commune had to conduct the dict@@ ated investigations .
it is therefore to evaluate the urban cont@@ est@@ ors to evaluate and decide when rehabil@@ it@@ ated and in which scope .
there will be a san@@ itation in the land register for the respective property .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again come to sensation and make a picture of the situation , promised them .
Got@@ zel stressed , a major success factor for the project , the participation of the participants .
therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires who are sent to citizens over the next few weeks and can be filled until the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow Questi@@ onn@@ aire is the &quot; building and bound@@ ary bow , &quot; which is among others in order to develop the construction situation and the renov@@ ations .
in grey questionn@@ aires , the &quot; household and housing , &quot; can be con@@ ferred on size , distribution and inhabitants of a living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode arc &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only sufficient when used in the building business rooms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it is aware that Got@@ zel pointed out that a complete questionnaire is not applied at the same time as a request for funding .
in addition , new construction measures cannot be eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler stressed that the distribution of funding is working according to the &quot; Wind@@ surfing principle &quot; - who first comes first , m@@ ah@@ lt first .
you could reserve no funding for later . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Local II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make a restoration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dirty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor uses a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his front door , his office can be entered and even start with a hand movement .

the cost of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the decision of the White House , a marine helicopter to the South La@@ wn to fly the American manufacturing last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers to the information of the military , which were transferred to the TI@@ ME magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the President is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and Chief of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states .
the helicopter was made in Connecticut with a yacht from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft truck from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft truck .
the Military Office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ ment@@ ary order or FRA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter on the South La@@ wn , after the records of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 ) , the unit , which is responsible for operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted to be aware of it , because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote Com@@ man@@ de@@ ur of the H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 on the eve of the event on his fore@@ front , the deputy Military Commander for aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message showed that the helicopter met on 17 July at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the event around 15 o &apos;clock , and so long stayed until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 o &apos;clock in this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of operating hours a second team would be needed for the return flight .
the original air@@ crew was during the helicopter during the helicopter , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the plane .
out of the records provided by the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether the second flight of flight was necessary .
the Hatch Act aims to use state ownership for political purposes .
records show that H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 has asked if the event could viol@@ ate the determination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question that we asked , if it was a violation of the Hatch Acts , and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote Commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are shut up , &quot; answered the substitute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was referred to the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the Hatch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political upper tones .
at the event , the President gave an agreement to reform the reform of health reform , which was in the Senate in G@@ ange , and he prop@@ ag@@ ated the efforts to increase the government regulations .
the use of aircraft , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon .
pre@@ sidents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but to request their use only for a photo @-@ OP , it is un@@ usually un@@ common .
Tr@@ ump led a study in February an investigation as the presidential plane in front of his first Kamp@@ ag@@ call r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that are thinking about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is excited by the show &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states depic@@ ting the American work with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deputy Director of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 cre@@ ations are often lead training flights in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn in order to add the US President in the White House with precise centimeters .
when Tr@@ ump was in Germany at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 in the White House took 58 exercise positions .
the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; event counted with the training requirement of the flight crew for the month , said an official .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units flew an additional 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers were not yet presented for any of the other pro@@ ps which were presented at the event .
a spokes@@ person for S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said the company was not involved in this way to exhibit the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 has no budget drawings for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ arium of the US Ministry of Defense for the financial year 2017 , the Do@@ D Group set for the V@@ H @-@ 3D however is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight .
records of the unit recorded the flight time of the airplane as 30 minutes from the home basis of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual costs for the operation of helicopter type is below the rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates for creation sets is highly ir@@ re@@ leader , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are contained in the annual funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the funds for Do@@ D does not include personnel costs , but consider the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract .
at that time , the White House of the White House , S@@ ean Sp@@ y , def@@ ended the deployment of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present these week things that are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connecticut greatly are proud to contribute to our national safety and I go out that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think of the most Americans are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have ti@@ relessly worked .
of course , it is appropriate , that gives you up . &quot;
it was not clear whether to inter@@ act with the helicopter , when he entered his tour over the South La@@ wn to the event , but he sat in the driving seat of a fire brig@@ ade .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and scher@@ sleben with the media over his own fleet of company products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to harm OMV
really happy , Donald Tr@@ ump was not really happy when he served on Wednesday evening his signature under the law to dis@@ embar@@ king the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his haste , the law en@@ acted , &quot; I wrote a few &quot; un@@ constitutional regulations . &quot;
the reaction of Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was in@@ scri@@ bed against the U.S. military .
after all , the draft stipul@@ ates to help European company , which help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines into the EU .
since then , investors of the loc@@ ating OMV is co @-@ financed together with other European firms the construction of the Russian Ost@@ se@@ el@@ strasse Nord Stream 2 .
the threat@@ ening is enormous .
nevertheless , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences such as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to raise the sanctions on life even by Executive Order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has watched that the Group could trigger and what could really do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; the offer is also valid in 35 @-@ hour supervision when children up to 14 o &apos;clock . &quot;
46 partial @-@ time forces from the 1st September kitchen service : you have warm the delivered meal , add them around salad , raw food and fruit , add the meal , give food out , cleaning and clean the kitchen .

G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vit@@ ie factory in Glasgow
a union would like to eng@@ age against the long @-@ term commitment to the production of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vit@@ ie over the long term commitment to production in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said , the company had co@@ sting about the future of investment at T@@ oll@@ cross @-@ site .
more than 500 employees work in the plant to create other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea K@@ ek@@ se .
Mc@@ V@@ ities owner Pl@@ adi@@ s said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that staff and trade representatives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be experienced , if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the company &apos;s head of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s ur@@ ges , &quot; concerns , that the financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be driven forward . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior Organ@@ izer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we have no clarity of the general requirements and investment plans for future requirements and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross .
generations of families have been working here and working forces strongly concentrate on local community and the large area Glasgow , an important pillar for de@@ cent employment in an area with high unemployment and social dis@@ advant@@ age@@ ous .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosper@@ ity , and before the background of Bre@@ x@@ it , increasing the rising cost of life and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow ur@@ gently ur@@ gently need a flor@@ ist production site at Mc@@ Vit@@ ie .
a spokes@@ person from Pl@@ adi@@ s said : &quot; branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter of G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to it , since we estimate continuous commitment at employees and trade union representatives .
we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , with some questions open .
we discussed with the employees that we are like all companies that are working in an extremely competitive and un@@ certain economic climate , our stores are operating and the same applies to all our business areas and locations - to be competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross country , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recognize the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility and completely . to change our business processes at the location , staff and trade representatives will be the first to learn this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona war@@ ned three years ago ?
the site of La Liga likes her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain has not been viewed in its persecution of Ne@@ ym@@ ar after they have an offer of £ 189 million to resolve his release cl@@ ause , but have they war@@ ned Barcelona three years ago ?
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than the double of the previous mark , whereby Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds .
after completion , Ne@@ ym@@ ar is the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athl@@ ete . PS@@ G provides wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is angry about the way , as Ne@@ ym@@ ar developed his way to outside , though a source in the vicinity of the Catalan executive board insi@@ sted that the club has always been given to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013 to take care of him .
but became the soccer world three years ago from the PS@@ G president war@@ ned of this view ?
when Manchester City 2014 was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di , Nasser had a strict warning for every association to sign one of the best player from PS@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not concerned because they touch one of our players , then we will contact them in opposition to them , we will contact their players &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
but if they try to sign one of our players at sign , this consequences will have consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , with the Spanish club in the beginning of this summer interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti express .
PS@@ G made clear that they would not allow it to travel to the International from Italy , under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest in which she lost a prize for Ne@@ ym@@ ar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ estic Auth@@ ors L@@ last@@ ly Pope @-@ Bro@@ ther Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ ends Report for the ab@@ normal@@ ities of the Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
that is the author and hist@@ ori@@ ans Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the ab@@ dic@@ ally sc@@ and@@ al in the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Cathedral Choir continues for discussions .
Christian Weis@@ sen@@ ing , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are church , &quot; explained by the former Reg@@ ens@@ burger bishop and today &apos;s Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as the founder Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year old brother of the emer@@ ald Pope Benedict XVI .
it would be very serve to the view of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would expos@@ e their deep@@ enings over their own sub@@ missions , or at that time the false assessment of the processes would be expressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican Chancellor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ servat@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; however , critic@@ ised that in case of coverage over violence in the domain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; measures measured &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
regarding the over@@ g@@ av@@ ings in Regensburg , no one knows that it would have to be prevented &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and damaged deeds , &quot; but the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , hist@@ ori@@ ans and member of the National Italian Bio@@ eth@@ ics Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the god@@ liness , the cath@@ olic church as a source of all evil experience , is already part of the everyday experience and preparing the public opinion that for normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Prin@@ c@@ Gloria of Th@@ urn and tax@@ is said in the interview with the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; one likes to go on the church and this is a folded f@@ uses . &quot;
in addition , she pointed out that in her youth &quot; Schl@@ ü@@ let &quot; have been a normal ped@@ agog@@ ical mean , &quot; to do with joy@@ ful children , as I was one was finished . &quot;
they are un@@ fair to use today standards for earlier decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with the reports about the failure accidents , Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger too often appeared .
totally wrong , author and hist@@ ori@@ ans Michael Hes@@ emann , who translated with R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says E@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he considers the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is written in the 440 @-@ page report written by the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment of At@@ tor@@ ney Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger domains were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , with high pl@@ au@@ sibility &quot; victims of survi@@ ving , 67 cathedral spar@@ rows sexually ab@@ used .
in the final report , it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was working in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can hold that from Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. was applied in many cases forms of physical and mental violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even at high reliability , the punishment for the pupils could also be severe .
nevertheless , in contrast to numerous others , many victims were estimated to ass@@ ert the general humanity by R. estimates and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories were connected with him . &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann , why the final report on the failure of Miss@@ issi@@ sc@@ and@@ al was explained by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger of his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inci@@ dents of Viol@@ ence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a contra@@ dic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for one raise many students up his &quot; humanity . &quot;
in the other hand , he also appears as Chol@@ eri@@ ker and Perf@@ ection , who became hand@@ some in the Ö@@ f@@ teren is musi@@ cally no top performance .
how do you evaluate this final report as his biograph@@ er report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you read the trouble and read the full 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you need to ask , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger must be in it at all .
just eight pages dedicated to him and it is clear of any sus@@ pic@@ ion of the middle or co @-@ knowledge in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
violence also took place at the fore@@ front of its effici@@ encies outside of its active sphere .
you can re@@ ject it all if you are too late or first an@@ cho@@ oses have to have enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; redemption &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was written by practically all respon@@ dents , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; salvation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also describes him as &quot; warm , &quot; popular &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; correctly , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the guys regularly operated with cake , bis@@ cu@@ sen and Bon@@ b@@ ons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was surrounded by the grapes of children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a minority is worth over his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotions , which led to w@@ ut@@ ili@@ ent even times .
that he did not only cast them with chairs and cast the keys on the ground , but also ear@@ marked guys in the hair or ears , he had already deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and with@@ ered for it .
however , to his honor it has to be said that such educational methods in the frag@@ ile time , the 1960s and 1970s , were widespread , with parents as with teachers .
do you still know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think every one of us who was born before 1968 .
I also have experienced this in a world@@ ly school , a state Gymnasium .
compared with what actually comes in this report , namely the horri@@ ble sexual abuse and the violence at the fore@@ front , are the fre@@ il@@ i Bag@@ at@@ ellen .
there you already asks , if it is not more with his acquain@@ t@@ ness and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI , many media has just fell on him .
on the Bavarian Pope , many who have never understood it , still have ei@@ v@@ aul@@ ted .
but the truth is : the report un@@ loaded Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media in connection with the report a lot about the topic of abuse at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ mo@@ atzen station was reported in connection with the report .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger at the final report also placed any processing or co @-@ knowledge in terms of sexual abuse at the load ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual over@@ g@@ eries claims to have committed to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never tried me to speak with my father or mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a party representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embar@@ r@@ assing me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the true problem in the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment of sexual abuse , and is that most of the victims are silent .
if they trusted not even parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then definitely not a choir director , who had been working as a collector of the perpet@@ rators .
how do you evaluate the gu@@ inea fow@@ ls student of R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to the abuse of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a questi@@ oned students form@@ ulate it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case , in which he would have had to susp@@ ect ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) and would have had the respective perpet@@ rators .
I think it ... also for really ab@@ sur@@ d , to assume that ... Bu@@ ben in ur@@ gent or clear@@ er or rather opened , than against their parents , inter@@ nat@@ s@@ leaders , confi@@ denti@@ als , etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ th@@ ink@@ able . &quot;
thus the report is coming to the very clear result : &quot; that they trusted in advance of the pupils and / or their environment , could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot;
for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is advis@@ able to discuss any mit@@ igation .
so it can &apos;t be thrown into it , not prevented him or have brought it to the ad .
therefore , there is no reason to bring his good names with these conflic@@ ting crimes in connection , as it happened in some cases .
in the media was much of &quot; violent food &quot; at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Cathedral .
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of the &quot; Weg@@ ener &quot; report .
do he have to live with this approach ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the great problem that in the coverage was missing and for@@ bid was a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is exactly what is a mis@@ use of the report .
that is , clean up : between the suburbs and the Gymnasium of the Dom@@ estic atzen , between sexual abuse and violence as well , we say once , other pen@@ alties .
in addition , the report has been treated from the time since 1945 , thus from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not choir director of the cathedral .
the whole aw@@ ful exam@@ ining education , the cases where the child of sa@@ st teachers were regular and painted them , were all of them involved in the pre@@ school in Et@@ ter@@ zh@@ ausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen where truly sc@@ and@@ al@@ ous states have to have .
but with whom Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys only to face when they were already on the high school .
on the way , as most of the most witness , the theme of &quot; Pre@@ school &quot; tab@@ oo . &quot;
it was only happy to be coming back and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ a@@ this &quot; states .
what was different at the gram@@ mar school ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was already discipline , but no sa@@ st violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , at the end of the report that &quot; many victims have estimated the general humanity of R. estimates and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories with him . &quot;
there is no one who remains to have the treas@@ uries .
but despite all efforts , the report was able to define just two periods , in which it was reported by the states of the pre@@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish and began to establish its predecess@@ ors at a school where he had not worked and responsible for him ( as the witness ) nothing wanted to hear , and then again around 1993 .
closed Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in front of the states consistently the ears ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asium who even re@@ produced the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this indicates that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will continue to practice the test penalty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Vor@@ schule &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
already in view of the danger of negative press signs .
that was , of course , as legal clarity , was illegal in Bavaria as a result of legal clarity .
before they occurred in a legal gray zone like every one of us knows .
there was too heavy for him to estimate , where the affected people may have over@@ drive or dramatic , where really the permissible limit was exceeded .
but one can &apos;t say , that he could always take away .
this is not true .
only in 1980 , the test penalty was officially abolished in Bavaria .
in the Gloria of Th@@ urn and tax@@ is claimed it is un@@ fair that today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards to that time .
how do you see that ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking to the historian of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; thus the danger , past to present moral standards .
since the prin@@ cess has already quite right .
but this is not true of sexual abuse , who was ab@@ h@@ able to all times , and not for what was broken in pre@@ school@@ ing and violence against innocent children , which goes far beyond that time .
this is all a terrible and I &apos;m glad that it finally works finally .
but at the same time I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means to discipline and age@@ ing , so ear@@ ne@@ on and listen to the hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s .
then , as physical punishment is forbidden , it also has been kept strict about it .
which picture from his Reg@@ ens@@ burger Time , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger has given to you the book &quot; My Bro@@ ther of the Pope &quot; in the talks ?
came the subject of testing also to language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it goes around the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedict XVI , tells of his perspective , as the cathedral spar@@ rows only played a side role .
nevertheless , in no means , I didn &apos;t forget that he led a new reg@@ iment there .
but this must once again be said : without these perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without un@@ conditional discipline , it would probably hardly been possible to form a true cultural ambassador in Europe and its musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with K@@ ek@@ sen and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , one turns out of contra@@ di@@ ligent boy once a big singer and in front of each success , on which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ over@@ coming .
what a man do you have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger on the talks about their book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : because of work in the book and beyond , I have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and again and again as a wonderful , hum@@ orous , basic good man , deeply believers and warm good people , from which one could not imagine that he could do only a fly somewhat a little bit .
I regularly get acquain@@ ted with how many former dom@@ est@@ ranged today , 23 years after his retirement , regularly contact him , visit him - he is almost blind - and he is like a member of her family .
those who didn &apos;t forgive him until today , that he once was strictly to them , are clearly in the minority .
most Dom@@ estic atzen are than@@ ked to him today that he en@@ riches their lives and brought them to the world of music .
and that he always had a good , v@@ ehem@@ ently teacher - a str@@ ingent father , eat , that may be - but also a lovely resp@@ ect@@ ful resp@@ ect@@ son , too which she still has seen and honor them .
and please , once more clearly : all that one would need for him , correc@@ tive methods that were at the time at the time .
we can be glad that we have long been overcome that time .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man , only because he is promin@@ ently and has a more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al fall into sin .
then is the evil purpose that is behind it is obvious to be obvious .
for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves him .
now the pitch command , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria , perhaps in Germany , nobody would have to know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ mo@@ atzen station , finally in peace .
