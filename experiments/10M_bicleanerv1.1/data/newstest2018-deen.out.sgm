<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your sight to the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An err-Anstalt, where young people are to meet.</seg>
<seg id="3">A Gruftchapel, where is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners generate the lonely cause of peasants.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map Münch promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It nerves if land cards are not currently able.</seg>
<seg id="7">This knows everyone who had to move to a green meadow because the Auto-Navi was on a green meadow.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas Bayern of the State government, are all other than currently - yet is now very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare it with current online-cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it is clear how towns and communities in the area of the Munich Mercury has changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria Atlas is a flip-carpet, which one can not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the great overview map for cities and municipalities, more detailed maps, called Urpathonic leaves, were incorporated into the big picture card.</seg>
<seg id="13">This originated according to the Bavarian surveying administration between 1810 and 1864, and from the first surveying of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your principal: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800, during the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted a survey of the occupied country and was commissioned by a topographic survey of Bavaria - of course to military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if French troops marched with the peace of Lunéville from February 9, 1801: there were the neighbors who created the idea of an extensive Bavaria map.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph drove the project further, founded the" Topographic Bureau "" "" - and thereby the Bavarian surveying administration. "" "</seg>
<seg id="19">The charter sheet for Munich originates from the year 1856 and can be found as all others at the Bavarian Authority's website.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early days / Today is the most impressive capital for the most impressive.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has grown to all directions and has grown rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is submissions that is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map, in 1877, in the district of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today Subscription is in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses can be concentrated around 1856 along the today's Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, you can see nothing as fields - at the first glance: when in the zooming, a small part numbers with dozens of lines and numbers: hand-numbered Flurks from the so-called "Urumption," which was derived from which the property tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots have no more farmers there today - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green space distinguishes itself north of sub-sendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810, became a meadow of the Oktoberfestation in the 19th century, there was a meadow and a concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historic map shows a insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the district court, the au-Haidhausen district is not just reading the street name "at the fan," or from the altitude "on the fan," but also in large letters "mistaken Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfield Road they were once unlocked people with madness.</seg>
<seg id="33">In 1858 / 59 the Munich Circle-Irene Institute began in the exhibition "Auer fans."</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872 Dr. Bernhard had led the establishment of the institution - that psychiatrist who was brought to death by King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the wells of the so-called." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he says the staff, violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum Haidhausen, who has worked for an exhibition with the Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="37">First place for 280 patients was first place, later on 500 places was expanded.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sometime, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for construction of the Kreisirrenunciation Camp in 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">There have been the Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-Ost since 2006, one of the largest psychiatrists in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="40">On the occasion of the former Auer Anstalt, young people meet in Munich Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and took him in a youth shelter with training course.</seg>
<seg id="42">Located west is the football pitch of the TSV Munich east, east of residential homes from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, we established the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" - in architectural rejection to the original building of the Irrenanstalt, who had been destroyed during WWII in bombing raid over the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was listed in 1856 as the main square, "Kaufingerstraße named" Kaufinger alley. "</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought the Second World War even in the heart of Münker.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies broke many holes in the city center in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big remained until today - on Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institut, small business houses and a Gruftchapel from the Middle Ages were once on Marienhof, where this day will take place and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony will take place for the second S-Bahn station.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider, the old Munich-card can be filled with the aerial picture of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Group publishes Travelers for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for Promoting Color has issued a warning for colored people due to discriminating politics and racist attacks by the State of Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which might enter into force on August 28, 2017, demands special attention and missourians, since a series of fragile, road-based incidents in the entire state and here are noted," it is stated in the statement of the group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recent law of Missouri that makes people heavier to win a discrimination of discrimination, as well as the prosecution agencies of the state having disproportionate to minorities, the group recorded the travel agent, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have violations of the citizens of citizens.</seg>
<seg id="55">They will be routed because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"we hear complaints in an incidence that we haven't heard yet."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group quoted incidents such as racist attacks against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under fragile circumstances in the beginning of the year, after he had no petrol during the journey through the State of Missouri, and by the police of Missouri were accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also refers to a recent report by the Office of the Office of Missouri, in which black drivers will be more common in the state 75 percent more common.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware of men and their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people have to be willing to bring out the money, or know the relatives that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">In 2015, Missouri was able to break in Hasselt, after the latest numbers from Hasselt's report program of the FBI, which capitalize the state with regard to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel armament is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would be difficult to accuse a company because of living or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued a trip for Texas and Arizona, after the states of immigration authorities undertake to understand people because of immigrant attacks, which will contribute to the ACLU to further expansion of the ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travellers are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but at the last time, stakeholders have used the action as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is Elemental</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbach Weimar project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Bundestag with the CDU Bundestag and Kordula Kovac have set itself a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the legal venue of the Schwendemann family, the representative of the CDU-area of the CDU-area were met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann granted first insights into his company, where he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest cultivated, 40 milk cows, and as many young men supplies and houses in five apartments Ferienges.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Schwarzwaldmilk" "" "is for him the alternative relief road for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">In the course of the Ferihedge of the Ferihedge there is exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since it is also BLHV-Chairman of Fischerbach, he called the electric fence as "Elemental project."</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot be profitable for such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green land care for a lot of work, much to be processed with the engine sense.</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have been here with the conditions and with the topography," stressed by Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the elternal operation and acquired this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he lead no biooperation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "" "the commune has recognized the meaning of the electric fence project and is happy about the leader funding." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At costs of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers should be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">We hope that the collection of surfaces could be pulled out for a period of time.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have, are the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts on how they continue to bring their operation," "" "stressed the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often stated because of the funding often in criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013 a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The surface area is thus 40 hectares, which must not be stopped until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half of the leader was promoted, a quarter contributed the congregation of Fischerbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Therefore, the farmers stayed 12 610 euros that they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you do not make a good job, without farmers and landing."</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "also for Peter White," "" "here the best foods are produced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The State Territories (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state support of women fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is to maintain the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The presence of one of the LPR has provided funding.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the inocative area should not be harmful (hangar to 35 per cent) and must be threatened by the order.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the 2018 Fischerbated Weimar project, eight participants currently runs with 24 plots, which would like to build nearly 16 kilometres of fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The open surface area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is to attack when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans estimate these same as any other - therefore the sorrowful fall of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos place in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, knew what he did when he took a symbolic number in a heat battle with Jim Acosta of CNN on the proposals of the president to drastic limitation with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller didn't handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A Horde of Bodies and Liberty Imitators had a gynthesis if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he attacked their significance, and in particular the importance that it was attributed to Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, its base was added.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta testified, "I don't want to enter a full thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom which lighteth the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem, which you should refer to which later was added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is true, but as he formulated it itself, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is concerned about the contemporary resonance on the rising words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state does not only charge any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "to the poor, thy poor, and thy afflictions that go free to breathe out, and destroy the waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "elende" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller committed themselves in literary criticism - he clearly made that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict due to the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural conflict: it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends, who want to place their words after her death on the basis - knew very good that they all completed a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicans, showing the female bonding of the freedom in a unused classical representation of the freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem is the female figure no more abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And there is a very different name: mother of Exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativity.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue, the people wanted to change the people from the right wing.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great cry of the Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued 2010, that the Statue of Liberty cannot call, but rather an early neo-conservative, which will bring the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty goes forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch shall not shine the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh left here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite and even a question of the point of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus also existed in it to see how they had seen from the exhausted, but hopeful people after long and often horrible trips on the deck of ships was seen.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from perspective of people who seek refuge and improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome that they must listen.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that's not the perspective, the Miller and Trump would ever want to recognise.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch shall not shine forth the way, but the hatred, the only source of power is ignited.</seg>

<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle reminds one of time when only two scorn belonged to the Team of Great Britain</seg>

<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals of medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butler - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m route, while Eilidh Doyle was elected to the team's team.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Their capitals was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a series of athletes, no matter whether they were Scottish or practice, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and true feeling that the Eilidh was very natural, was great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medallists who will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400-m Hurdles, says that it is "unbelievably" that 16 barriers are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland has been the best total of athletes at the Worldchampionship in 1983, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle runner Muir is on this path and has set up five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m races.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, which runs 1.500 m, is another Scotsman running after a great season that was included in the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle commemorates their first World Championships, when the only other Scotsman was in the team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The mantle capitals says that they are "enormously proud" on the fact that many of their countrymen are not only belong to the team, but in some cases also with medals and the final.</seg>
<seg id="151">"" "" "" "the special about team capitals lies that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that there was something great honour for me, but to know that my team mates voted for me and chose me something very special for me" "" "she added." ""</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously I am very proud of all the villi that belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It just shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as well-established athletes, athletes who want to rise in Podien.</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech related to Chapterin?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think it went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only noted that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home World Championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it's really important to put on these homeways and benefit from it that we are back in the Olympic stadium.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go out there and compete, and it's just like a great atmosphere there outside. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Block from critics on Facebook: do not worry about a public position if you cannot bear the heat of voters.</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew some worse press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it took not long until the newspapers beat him because of the inner policy until his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He rebuked on the critique, safely.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not put his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">In 1783 Washington, Washington, said: "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and dumb we will lead like the sheep for the battles."</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who needs to work more than Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and sold their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union proverts him therefore at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The staff of the governors dismissed the lawsuit as frivolan, and the online comment was full of a counter reaction with "Na, and?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's only Facebook," they said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it's a type such as Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishing.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors' governors.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a fixed hand with the leadership of its state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also well sent to use Facebook as a primary resources to connect to his electors and play his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blocking of people who come to the site of the governors - which is a public forum, which is officially designated as officially and by employees who are paid by public tax-Dollar - unnecessary and finally dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post defended Hogans spokesperson Amelia Chasse the actions of the governor and argued that the comments of comments was nothing more than a Moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too simple to use the image of trolytes or water-filled people who force the lines online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke with some of the real people that were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only true people who speak with their chosen leaders, a teacher, a businessman and a priest, no Trolle.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectable, non-violent and non-profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans of the Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Attorney at Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., wasn't hassfilled, but she questioned to Hassle.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to Hasselt and other recent news," "" "she wrote in the commentary area" The Post. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I don't count this idea if a number of people takes place on the same theme, then they are misused by some more than a so-called collections and not as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">What the staff of the governors as a "concentrated spam attack" would call others "intercession."</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut out a message by simply deleted a critic or a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is a lot of cleaner than in previous days when you have done the same people that staff have been sent to collect newspapers and to burn and burn newspapers, and to burn, or to remove activists.</seg>
<seg id="191">But exactly this happened to digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials, which is criticized that he has implied on Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is complained by Twitter users suffering from his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairwoman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County last the first amassing, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, named a voters from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, governor Matt Before (R) received a visit from ACLU due to his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">That should not be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of affordable portrait had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers tolerated themselves between 1776 and 1800; and anonymous Letter of letters struck on his lead.</seg>
<seg id="200">And at that time Washington had anonymous Trolle.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people, the pseudonyms such as "Lawicola," called "Belisarius," and "Portius," wrote all letters to newspapers, which made Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions, who criticised its position over the contract of Amity, trade and shipping with the United Kingdom of criticized his ministry, according to the historical documents, collected by the Online Papers of the George Washington Project.</seg>

<seg id="1196">It makes particularly much fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons Unterlippenbart of "Singles," whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old backer.</seg>

<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is committed so much for the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda-drums, a murderer that carries a Reagan mask, it is often used as a single one.</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps is planning new Chief of Staff to restrict the media abstinence of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others tried it and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico tells us that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restrict the information flow on President Trump - including reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss on a consistent course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"" "" "" "when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, at his first day of work with executive employees, he set forth a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he would repairing: bad information that go into the hands of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in letter - because the President's better decisions would come if he would obtain good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Ways Diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to imprint Trump by closely monitor its media.</seg>
<seg id="1397">The president Trumps relation to television is enough for decades - and now, where he is in the White House, its TV advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if the candidate Trump was offended because of an unfair coverage, it was productive to convince him that he received a fair coverage of places that were to convince," said the former election campaign Sam Nunberg in February against politico.</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the keys to keep Trumps Twitter habits in control, according to six former election campaign officials, to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay. okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter are ever "under control," is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps this campaigns know something that we do not know others - that Trumps Tweets had to contain more ignition material without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We probably never know something about the Tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his staff had made it several times, trouble shooting from him, then their effort was worth it.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently preventing the trump controverses.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem consists in that people in a White House, which are composed of competing parties, always trying to present their own agenda by promoting trump material, that may foster their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - entirely with this history - reported in May about the preference of adviser to contribute to the president of strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example that was described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former trump civil servants say that Trump can react like a volcano on negative press parts, especially those with damaged Lecks, and that he could recover it out of this." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly this happened at the end of February, when somebody accused a printed copy of an article of GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Provokateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the Deputy Chief of Staff of Katie Walsh, "the source behind a heap to be of Lecks" at the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson has banned from Twitter due to chicans, or that he has no concrete evidence, or that he is expressed in the past false allegations and contradict them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began to inquire about Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">In addition, Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tries to implement a system to manage and document the Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did it work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same for three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as a priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his adviser still continues to influence.</seg>

<seg id="1481">The Committee recorded the work in the past few weeks, wrote the "Wall Street Journal" on appeal to the case.</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper read the step as a sign that Mueller had expanded its investigations and intensified.</seg>

<seg id="1484">U.S. secret services accuse the Kremlin since extended to have targeted targeted in the presidential campaign in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examined whether they spoke between Trumps election team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the focus of the investigations, several men are to stand in the election campaign as consultants of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to report, Mueller also took more and more Trumps private and business environment among the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"" "the Washington Post" "" "wrote some weeks ago that" "" "Washington Post wrote personally to the center" "" "and asking the allegations that the President in the course of the affair might obstructed the justice" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jurassiys is to check and decide to verify whether the prosecution is to be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys are therefore called Prosecution.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly they are switched on if there are larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure always takes place behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The committee can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to invite people to the hearing below Eid.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN transmitter, there were already preaches to make the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">Persons who were involved in the meeting was asked to be called by a statement, it was called in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">Moreover, they should provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Next to Trump Jr. were Trumps adviser and law-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his fellow election of Paul Manafort.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening in the US television that the objectivity show that Mueller may not be sober in his work, and that it should be necessary to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">However, it must not necessarily be called the Grand Jury at the end to decide on the survey of an accusation.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the establishment of the Gremiths of the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new reason to concern the concern for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the middle of the new disclosure of the President on Thursday evening a speech in West Virginia, in order to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"Russia history is a total invention," said Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The topic of the Democrats give a possibility to feel "to feel good, because they have nothing else to talk about it."</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special adviser Ty Cobb explained in a position, he did not know anything from the enforcement of a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But these work usually work in salaries, he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House advocates any measures that accelerated the work of the special event on "fair" mode.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI boss James Comey said three times that he would not be determined against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">I have no reason to assume that something has changed something, it was further in the declaration.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had been used only after Trump Comey had been fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Because of this assumptions were diminted against Trump, he would afford the judiciary of justice.</seg>
<seg id="1511">In June, Comey said to a Senate Committee, Trump asked him for a attitude of investigations against the then national security consultant Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is due to the investigation under large pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1513">According to the evidence of US media, the White House Material gathered together against the Special Enmediator and his employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">That disbanded speculations about whether Trump Mueller would be released.</seg>

<seg id="1533">There is a lot that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger, because the front edge have never withdrawn so far as far as currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice plate stands out of voltage and could be cut off, if a piece is ablocked in one piece.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg increases the sea level as they swim in the water and ice as much water as it yields after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the shaft indicates that the glaciers can go directly into the sea and much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the level of sea level, but only in a low degree, writes the British research project for observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest Schelfeis of Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometers.</seg>
<seg id="1539">On the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 metres thick, on the front edge for the free ocean about 200 meters.</seg>

<seg id="1580">In Italy, NGOs, the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they may not continue to continue to keep the rules of their operations.</seg>
<seg id="1581">"if NGOs have no new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can work on," said Interior Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minitis warning was a day after the Italian authorities had confiscated a boat of the German aid organisation 'Youth Rettet', because their crew worked effectively with traffickers in a way which facilitated the illegal immigration.</seg>

<seg id="1588">At least one of these efforts were supposed to be held just 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast, according to the nudes of the prosecutor, whose content was published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The crew is suspected to take over the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the Code of Conduct, boats have to have used boats such as Iuventa mainly a Italian police officer, which monitors their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have now been prepared to hold the code: save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be unnecessary but unacceptable, since they would no need "major changes or disabilities" of their rescue actions.</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Peace Laureates for Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>

<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the Lavendel in Provence is effective, because the plant was exposed to climate change over the past years, that in spring much less rain and in the autumn much more.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effect on the lifespan of Lavendel.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small Zikade, a microbotic membrane, which transmits diaphragm, and there are very many of them. "</seg>

<seg id="1802">Lavender oil is not only for vacationships, it is also asked for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said, "instead of very long plant watches with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, UNTERENTWICKELTE and either lack or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have less parts with essential oil. "</seg>
<seg id="1805">For the solutions that are considered to be considered a better water distribution and the slowdown of evaporation from the ground, but also the occupations of plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to drying.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the weekly Riodoce arrive normally on Wednesdays to review their plans for the reporting of the youngest chaos within the state of Sinaloa by the organized crime, corrupt civil servants and irregular drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists will discuss what is safe: you should take their children with the office in 2009 which were the goal of a attack with Grants, or to leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have three words on a panel on the front of the room: opponent, Neutrale, Allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">It is necessary to propose a reporter, names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and panic.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug adgler, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand at the salary list of the government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals which make the chaos of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no silence of violence, and during the whole country the corpses are more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto entered its office in December 2012. 589 are under attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there were at least seven deaths in seven countries.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her editor and her inspirator of Riodoce, the Mitfounders Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and journalist," "" "Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books about violence in connection with drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is deeply impressed, even though its presence is present - a large photo of Valdez, which shows its middle finger with the word "Justice". two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts, that demonstrate its smiling face with glasses or typical panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop will take place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their divided themes, trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Even though 2010 was created by the Attorney General, in order to process the cases of journalists, this is directed according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, only two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of Morden, who are associated with drug trading and organizational crime every year, the murderers of journalists only rarely be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodours, they still consist on to handle the violence of Sinaloa, although it is illegal and even though the terrain is still routed.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information on the murderer, without righteousness, the meeting on the discussion of safety has little benefits, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to turn my time in this workshop," says he.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we know why we know all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a couple of blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was forced by two men. it was forced by his car and was shot in him for 12 times, probably due to the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "12th" river. "</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius drove away in his car and damaged it near.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic of Valdez there are practically nothing in silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans's arrest in the past year and of extradition to the United States in January was Sinaloa became one of the bloody slaughter fields of the country, since rivalising fractions fight here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa each day someone will be shot each day or several people on the street, or that the graveyard is full of enchanted, two-storeyed Mausoleum that are larger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "rest" if only a cartel control over the coastal waters with its valuable harbours and drugs trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, in spite of the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the fault that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two abuse have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">In February the publication of a interviews with Damo Lopez, a leader of a rivalled cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have been missed the children, having believed the power issued every copy of the issue, as soon as they were extradited to newspaper kioske.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second fault was in that Valdez did not force to force after the arrest of another newspaper that had published the same history to leave the country for its own safety.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had so long survived that his friends and colleagues would say that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste when he completed five colleagues to the founding of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars investments.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to operate journalism, without stumble to the noise of the noise," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1847">With the time, the newspaper had served as a reputation because of courageous and honourable reporting, and sales and advertising.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporter it, hard trestating investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication that they could read stories that nobody else could be treated.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodours, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot prize" for their coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists in the persecution of the Mexican drug history, where she also led them.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave willingly that he had fear.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to live," he said at the time of CPJ.</seg>
<seg id="1853">Drug trade in Sinaloa, is a way of life, "said he in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you need to take the task that will take you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I would not want to be asked:" "" "what have you done? why did you not tell what happened before?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodours team missed Valdez, the fun-bird that could curse the friend who was generously with hug and rating attacks, a teacher who knew how to survived.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always bear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always be to El Guayama, the bar opposite the office, go and sit always at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love to be a routine?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death has also been forced to ask her own interests in question as they can do their work on the best and staying alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it, if you are dealing with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret starting and landing ways to move drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," Bojorquez said.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-scenic and self-maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it is wrong, lead them away.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, the publisher of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal is that "smell a sense that can be mocked... and then the thing happened with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, such as he and others say, are in Sinaloa no more - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where a toxic mixture of lucrative dirt, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the employees of Riodoce met for security training, there were suddenly no cellphones allowed. days earlier this spyware that is sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">There were two policemen to protect against the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodours in a four-storey building in a mid-class quarter of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the shear, some of the reporters, whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of policemen who were not trustworthy of the governor itself as not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months ago since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drugs bound de facto are under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has moved to three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the former Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state expenditures, focused on the hometown of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the state-old, a kidnapping guided tour.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word that was abducted or as it was done so be careful when everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favourite locally of drug traders and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter found out of public records that the restaurant has been registered under the name of a policy, who ruled the rule of the Institutional Revolution Party (pri), who ruled all political levels throughout the whole century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several pri governors were accused of corruption in corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">In order to write the reporter concerning previous incidents in this locality, in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman had escaped a military failure.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months before the readers of Valdez had previously viewed as the best informed source about the abduction.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"previously, we knew what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El FLACO" because of its slim body.</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">The office of Valdez was dedicated to storage space for signs and stickers, dedicated to the murder of journalists, because the staff had become something, what they would never expect: activist in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration for another journalist for the office of the office.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burned body was discovered and civil servants say, based on DNA tests that it is of it.</seg>
<seg id="1890">In all the country, journalists has grown stronger, having written in organized protests "SOS Press" on obedience and builders.</seg>
<seg id="1891">This day, the director Bojorquez is in Washington and tries to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to express journalists and bring them to the truth, because they have told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">It has been asked since then that it is divided by the government because she is concerned that their rage has injured their objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez was repeatedly stated that journalists in Mexico from organized crime, involved government officials and a valid society. "</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco-journalism" he wrote that reporters are not only to be killed by drug law, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces that put together with the organised crimes under a ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="1896">"" "the media group" "" "Articulo 19" "" "performed more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and civil servants last year." ""</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico die, because they would like that you keep the mouth," said Ramirez.</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously the Mora have a terrible effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody is forgotten the death of the Bloginist Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Your body was found together with a note that allegedly signed by Zetas-Kartell: "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">One computer keyboard and earphones with its separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches voted to close as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border of Chihuahua after the assassination of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others do further, like El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of her directors in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez set up public on Drug Cartel with a motto on the front page with the heading "What do you want of us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists fled from their home states or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">It is hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and search for dangers.</seg>
<seg id="1908">And sometimes they are chased, as evidently the photographer of Reuben Espinosa, who was murdered together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz.</seg>
<seg id="1909">For those who continue to stay and continue the work, it is a daily dance with risk-rich decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Ibarra who once wanted to be a poet, indicates that the drug trade is terrified.</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to Hell, and therefore I became reporter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="1912">At midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was already completed, the editors of Riodoce at the office in front of the office and drank beer, when all their phones started to summed up.</seg>
<seg id="1913">A number of shooting paintings with band rivals and security forces near the Badeortes Mazatlan had left the dead in 19.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war continued, as it was promised by a number of Kartell messages in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">From the on-stone edge, they have published the news on the site of Riodours via mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The front page had to be changed next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens heets near - a further shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez threw a look at the policemen who kept guard to see if they were in readiness.</seg>
<seg id="1919">If they were afraid of fear, they did not show it.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Under the gigantic portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for all Sinaloa, the employees followed by Riodoce his traces.</seg>

<seg id="1925">It was so good that they could even determine that his shoe skin was from reddish Braun - and they said they would have had something of a "invisible past."</seg>
<seg id="1926">The report in the magazine "Current Biology" called him as "the beak-held dinosaurs, who has ever found, and one of the best Dinosaurs specimens of the world."</seg>
<seg id="1927">Fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurier who lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">His incredible good preserved condition has researchers to describe it as "really remarkable."</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the pumped vegetable fresser is the best preserved Fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Radio as he was in Suncor Millenium Mine at the Suncor Millenium Mine at Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, greb.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something that seemed to look at something from the surrounding rocks at the plateau, and decided to look more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all these hard work the finished result is ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"" "" "" "if you blind only a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept," "" "said the chief autor Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature has to see." ""</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it is one of the science story as one of the most beautiful and best preserved Dinosaurs copies - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers found that this plant is covered, although it is covered with a armor, probably resembles of flesh fressors dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The strongly paved dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide themselves before crack, and used a shielding technology that is known as counterfatting, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This could have been allowed to mix well in its surroundings and to soak his enemies, experts, which indicates that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier family has made headlines in May and is now visible in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and it was called Borealopelta markchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7.000 hours to cover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the pattern and form of sheds and armor about his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the confining, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was dark than their underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the contemplation is customary, the results are surprisingly, since the size of Borealopelta exceeds the size of the living animals.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs of sufficient pressure through meat fressful Dinosaurs has been observed that evolution of the confrontation of the confrontation as a means of survivors.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most of contemporary animals that use the contamers - remember Rehe, Zebras or belt animals - are a lot of small and violas for prey, what are signalized that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong Raubtier behavior on a massive, strongly covered dinosaurs, like dangerous the dinosaurs catbals of the Cretaceous have to have been" said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1948">Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaurs was red.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal on information about his life, including his confinite gut, to figure out what it did as its last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, was driven into a river and cast into the sea, where he fell on the back to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time Alberta was so warm like South-orida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much more landward than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it remains complete with contemplated skin, but also in three dimensions, remains the original form of the animal." said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"" "" "" "the result is that the animal is almost just as in the early Cretaceous period." ""</seg>
<seg id="1954">You don't need to use imagination to reconstruct it. if you only have a little with the eyes, you might believe that he is in sleep. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The Cretaceous period was time when gigantic theropodes, carnivorous dinosaur that stood on two legs, the earth went through.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived million years after Borealopelta, the paved dinosaurs was chased by some of his furious ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11,5 m) long, six tons heavy monsters.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Scientists, their latest findings in Current Biology appear, believe that Bomanopelta has been sunk after the death of the sea in the sludge.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Radio as he died on 21 March 2011 in Suncor Millenium Mine at Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, greb.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the retained dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the pumped vegetable fresser was shaken by the western Canada until a flooded river was flooded into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the subtle of the dinosaurs preserved his armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The remains of this special specimen are so good that the skin-calators still cover a prix tank plates along the dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko written for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is so rare as a gain in lottery.</seg>

<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to their core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just one day after they arrived in New York City, sitting in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an airbnb flat that they rented and scrollout through Facebook on their phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled on a mail of someone from the High School.</seg>

<seg id="2024">Confusing, since no one was posted on their feed the information, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah is constantly prayed to their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The Rapper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unknown black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white police officers in Ferguson, Mo., killed, live.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Browns leblosem body, which was stretched out on the street and stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"this is wild," thought Ferrell in itself.</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">You put on your mobile phone in order to get back later on the evening at Tweets on the Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of police band and people, who claimed, and from a man who claimed to be a sign with the inscription: "Fergusons police killed just my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">They observed a live feed, with which a policyhoist stood before a group of demonstrators with a bellhop dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In another video, she said, it secured another police station, and he cried, saying, "I will kill you... animals all kill."</seg>

<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">You booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6-year-old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two will drive on the next morning after Ferguson.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary movie, "Whose Streets?", in the cinemas from 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a story of lively and Protestants, love and power, the strength and resistance force, which consists of the point of view of people who live in the community and to ask the streets to ask answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell had her daughter, which brought a flower-dress, and a matching crown, carried out after Ferguson, the two had a conversation which they had countless times before this morning "on the black experience and the black state."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight against them?" "" "he remembered her that she said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2044">"" "" "" "we now go to Ferguson because the police killed a 18 year old boy, and that was not right." ""</seg>
<seg id="2045">I could not take it, "said Ferrell later.</seg>
<seg id="2046">"that is what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">You have to know and see it and pulled it in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It has to be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also know the various layers of the black experience and the black Constitution and what we must do to free to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even if I have good luck to give you an experience, in which they don't have experienced racism, it is not different than the next black women child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">"" "I have the feeling I would have a bad service to keep them far away." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which was waiting for a camp, when the activist was waiting for the possible non-accusation of Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">In there, Ferrell and her daughter joined together with a local owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags before and helped to pass on demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly Starting a new kind of activism for ferrell shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"" "" "" "my activism has changed after 9 August," "" "she said, and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, President of the Minority Student NCourse Association, focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black municipalities." ""</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has come all. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, Ferrell arrived at the evening demonstration of Sabaah Folayan, one of the film director of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">"" "Folayan said, she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to" "" "document what happened." ""</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question was Ferrell in the sense: "will you document or try to find a story that you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often from the White - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">Like Folayan recently stated in an interview: "we heard that people who had born in Ferguson and raised up their voices, and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, a artist from the field, who is known for his activism around death of death.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought Ferrell the project closer together with six other natives, the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Browns.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"" "" "" "this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us." "" "he said Davis." ""</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "that was the main thing for me as these people are represented, because I will be displayed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to concentrate on Ferrells experience - to show that it is not a Christ guide, but in order to come together, "said Folayan - they proved itself as the most obvious participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Follow these show documents of "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells Life, as she loves himself and marries her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell, and laughed, when she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the case of human beings." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells's history repeats the role of the black swans women in the wider Black-Lives Movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">In 2012, two of the three founders of movement, which have marked the film "BlacklivesMatter" in the year 2012, identified the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media, identify themselves as a gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, pregnant women in managerial positions have carried the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are struggling to various fronts.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Black, pregnant women have to wear the main load of all. "</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "Folayan voted to notice that" "" "the movement really held by black women and many black women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">However, it is insisted that "this is not the" mative type of action, "at the distance of their identity was selected as the heart of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2077">"" "" "" "she was the person who raged this energy," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2078">"" "" "" "it is no coincidence, although it was in front of the front, because in a life of these cloaks as a black, pregnant woman is so much on the game." ""</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">Meanwhile, the telecommunications eras in Ferguson has long disappeared, but the rassical connections between the congregation and the police continue.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years due to the blocking of a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the social and atmosphere of the area that she calls her home: "a chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Nevertheless she klash them to a voice and she feels like this memory, since then she went into Ferguson on the road three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"it is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>

<seg id="2088">"" "up to" "" "size" "" ": TV readers discuss a bit gallery." ""</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves the people, even though it is not built for long.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre on the south of the pedestrian area has been obsolete since the first presentation in 2009, the population in fears and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The topic is hardly a cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Also on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg" the subject is discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">While the one can say to a bit gallery: "this would be a dream" (Nicole Becker) or "that would be real-class" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "does not need a man" (Siggi Baking) or quite simple: "don't need!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the fears pointed out to build a gallery more customers in the city, the other shops are benefiting, fear the opponents, that then the pedestrian zone should be blotted out.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Added: the gallery is planned in the property, on which the farmmarket hall is located in the 13 direct market-marketed products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">The construction work will be at the end of the construction.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery Macher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and in Beda Square, with possibility of sitting outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone rooms: "we have been buying almost weekly in the peasant market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of Lands always felt very happy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">We have also discovered the butcher for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like that, during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketed in a market hall in the gallery is coming to the amount of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">This is likely to be low in the new project. "</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what shopping cart is in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether clothing, footwear, or supermarkets: I find the superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is already enough in our town.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many stores are empty here - some since months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Since there is not even a weekly market place here, it is so important that at least will receive us at least the market hall.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Because all this product is offered there, it is mainly offered directly from the producer and is observing.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As one can see, loads shops in a shopping centre will be rented only by larger firms, because the holiday rentals are often not portable for retailers.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, special transactions are almost no longer and what else is left, will probably disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall fits me not together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the peasant market during construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it manage to drive the-bit gallery before to drive all shops from Bitburg? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "this will not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">And shopping center, which is empty, does not need any one.</seg>
<seg id="2121">In my view, it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a peasant market, it is thanks to the mad many - how I find - senseless building projects in Bitburg no place more.</seg>
<seg id="2123">When the peasant market is stopped, a piece of culture will disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">An appropriate similarity: artist makes portraits of Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are visible - white, black and brown, which hang almost unnoticeably - that hang about cables of the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupside and hairdresser, which were sent by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent a 35-year prison sentence from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former intelligence service analytics posted a 35-year prison sentence after they set diplomatic missions on the web site of the Leaks.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2 August is A Becoming Resemblance (One matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was converted into their specialized expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transgression and the prophsidy, whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his position.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis of DNA that could look like anyone with these genomic data, a sharp if also some intellectual comment could not only be the formation of DNA data - the many ways as they can interpret and the inharder Determinism of these interpretations - but also to the identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born when Bradley Edward was born, but had already been spoken since their Puberty over the identification as a woman, was convicted in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violets against the spy law, computer was and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">By the prison, her picture was suppressed, so very that there was only one photo - a grain size, black-white befie, sitting in the maning and a platblonde cast - with which it was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg returned from the great success of their 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">It produced the artist portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette lighter and chewing gum, making the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of which these people could look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time that she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg with a press review of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not visit this time, and could not be photographed at this time, so they took contact with Chelsea and asked them whether they wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">In the course of two years, the artist and her imprisoned Muse were carried out by several letters in the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even illustrated one of Shoili Kanungo illustrated Comic "Suppliers Images," which would lead a future, in which the President Cheles would be able to see it personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama had actually only a few days after the book was published, Mannings was asking after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome type of happy additives.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also a time at the opening of the exhibition's something deep and Starkes, since Donald Trump takes a war against informant from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweet ways to meet the rigid spades, which he should recover, continue to escape.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked after the strange timing of all these things, she told that "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a close to the gallery of the gallery, he called for Manning with its oversized signature (the "i" in her family name) an end of "automatic disintegration, whose foundation is gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandler of Cs and Gs and As described in graphite.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific Lexicon of the artist) as amazing, at least in biological respects, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"" "" "" "what people hopefully will take care of what we are and how open genetic data for a interpretation and how subjective them are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works from 2007, Spurious memories is also visible. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell as many different stories, hence the 30 of these stories."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition which is kept in an own room is a site from the above-mentioned comic novelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning, as described in a hands-free spins in the United States of the United States as King-Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"" "" "" "if they have chill your words, then they won." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2154">Manning has not yet seen the exhibition - as it is predictive in the comic book - but when it should do it, then it will be greeted in the middle of the room of the masks, by their own genomic simulations that are joined as hordes of protest.</seg>

<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of his cozy seat in the valley of Kent and now is now for inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaarigen Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>

<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection which was inspired by documents in British Library - a project which he unexpectedly found.</seg>

<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it is not yet crazy, there is a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation issued for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robot) (FRR), a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor for robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we need to start their ascent.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, choose its form of nipple and type of fingernagel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people make a fun, but the company deliver lots of them, and we will see them too much more common," "" "said Mr Sharkey in the publication of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpuppen have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone foreskin that feels warm - with deliberately human reaction that can be achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also customize its robot according to his beliefs, "and then choose everything, from the eye color of the robot about the form of nipple to the type or color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But there will be even more worsening because many robots have the "personalities" which would look like a Stepford-Ms. progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen have evolved to robots with a silicone foreskin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The real Botix robot allows for example to adapt its users to adapt their robots to the properties that is appealing as tightness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is still the roxxxy Gold sex robot with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of relentity and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality who is adapted as good as possible," shielded the website of True Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So they like what you like, and they don't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day their vocations - very how real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">She can be tired, fixed on conversation, or it can be "in mood."</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many beatifying aspects in this ascent of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subjugated female properties that concerns a step on Frigid (is here: resistible) Farrah is unquiet one most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy with a vibration but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) have a vibration, why can men do not have Roxxxy?" it is called on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, this sex robot is not just a fat or ambush just another sex lighter.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Her emergence and its increasing refinement show a slightly darker and deepest in our culture, to retreat from the Ideal of Gender equality to a wish after sex with subjugation as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will make no sex robots, while the FRR noticed their increasing popularity, they still remain temporary on the edge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what things out of the boundary zones can be leakened in terms of the spirit of time, in which we live, very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strangely enough, but the free market for these are permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain reasoning that this highly developed sex robots are threatened with a time in which the rights of women are threatened by women in which there have a presidents who made women sexual violence in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrifying aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the handmaid ') are not the graphic pictures, the closed body and the cast eyes, but how realistic this vision seems.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment do not feel like a big jump.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind this sex robots exists, a physical similarity to real women as realistic as technically possible (if also with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders refused to feel human body that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>

<seg id="2424">Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney to the appearance of healthy human understanding</seg>
<seg id="2426">It is become a Binsular era of the Trump era, that the political circuits that have dealt the US voters even families in small-format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Erntedankfest there were newspapers in the USA and deal with advice regarding the face of Trump-Trump's horror.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We meet all supposedly, to leave our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">In less then, the power of Trumps, families have been merged.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I chose this, because my cousin, a left-focused dichterin which lives in Chicago and has long attended with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that the unit can have a mighty enemy against a common enemy.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone who knows it, including Republican transformation, with which they had fought for decades, suddenly and completely independent on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">In order to ensure the dining table, this certainly is a good thing, but it falls in a further context that this also brings significant risks with themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left hand was strengthened by Trump, but the effective effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">If we speak of "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the gruselly option that our kittens will not stumble for one day.</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is however an even more terrifying long-time scenario, in which Trump Republicans of the Right wing "normalizes" which suddenly appear in comparison with his standards as ingestion of failure.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I found myself from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urrecess version of the back then - the dog on the car body, which saw 14% revenue tax (but at least did we know how his tax statement) - both in comparison to Trump in fact a very mild criminal offences.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of Republicans must be spiritual healthy, to qualify as an unmeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin in the city was, we brought our children to Karussell in Central Park, the largest of the carousel's car park, and the best three dollars which one can spend in the city if you are no caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass design on the central cylinder - all clowns are crisy and the animals are turned to watch over their own shoulders - extremely finster and the climate of music will be conveyed in a notable way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clashes of a city disappointed: the views of high buildings are old, the Skylines are familiar to provide a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not be justified.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not completely over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the Topic Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not one - but a big roundabout in the North London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park-Karussell is still a strange magical experience, since there are two two-year-old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-s and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I would have been able to rate the carousel, I would have given to him the full score, but fortunately, nobody has asked after that.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">At the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to balance an average of 15% tip - this to buy something about the shop.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This does not lead to a slowdown of what actually should be a neutral exchange, but also practised pressure on the server to bring it into a situation where no required is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was blending, while I tired the experience I made my credit card with five stars.</seg>

<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a nighter penetration that hidden himself in the cabin.</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can make your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, the symptoms of patients with anti-inflammatory bowel diseases might.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The indisputable condition that affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States in the United States, causing stomach and bleeding, recurring or bluish failures, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">During those affected, meat and dairy products usually come to avoid their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan increased by proteins to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The senior researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immuncells in the intestine patrol to ensure that harmful microbes that hide themselves in the food, not into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are capable of disable inflammations, are balanced by cells, to protect the tolerance and protect the body without sensitive tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in a inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments it was determined that a type of tolerance promoting immuncell in mice that can carry a particular bacterium in their bowels.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the stones of proteins - to resolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterium - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiosis, and the development of a population of cells that promote the tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice in their food, the more had them from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He proposed that the combination of L. reuteri and one of tryptophan rich nutrition tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal milieus promotes when the same system is even in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral degree in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan sought a kind of immune cell when it found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe that had been accommodated but not had.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbiosis of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungus, who normally live in the stomach-intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice of the mice were detected DNA sequenzes and they were found six bacterets that were present in mice with immune cells, but without they were missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were moved in a sterile environment, so that a intestinal microbioma were missing and they did not developed this kind of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria can grow to the immune system, the researchers decided to grow in a liquid and then led small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells that were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">Immune cells developed to the tolerance submarine cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component is cleaned from the liquid, it proved to be known as a side-product of tryptophan metabolic, which is known as Indol-3-lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers have doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 per cent, but when the tryptophanism were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerant cells like mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal traps.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan-side-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with anti-inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said: "the development of these cells is probably something that we would have to promote, since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially explosive tryptophan values can lead to an extension of this population in the presence of L. reuteri.</seg>

<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspends Report for the abnormalities of the Pope Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">That is the author and historians Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abdically scandal in the Regensburger Cathedral Choir continues for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weissening, spokesman of the reform movement "We are church," explained by the former Regensburger bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as the founder Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year old brother of the emerald Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would be very serve to the view of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger would expose their deepenings over their own submissions, or at that time the false assessment of the processes would be expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican Chancellor," "" "Osservatore Romano," "", "however, criticised that in case of coverage over violence in the domain" "" "measures measured" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">Regarding the overgavings in Regensburg, no one knows that it would have to be prevented "shameful and damaged deeds," but the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historians and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the godliness, the catholic church as a source of all evil experience, is already part of the everyday experience and preparing the public opinion that for normal" "" "writes Scaraffia" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">The PrincGloria of Thurn and taxis said in the interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk: "one likes to go on the church and this is a folded fuses."</seg>
<seg id="2898">In addition, she pointed out that in her youth "Schlület" have been a normal pedagogical mean, "to do with joyful children, as I was one was finished."</seg>
<seg id="2899">They are unfair to use today standards for earlier decades, because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports about the failure accidents, Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger too often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Totally wrong, author and historians Michael Hesemann, who translated with Ratzinger, "My brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection" "" "says Eemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he considers the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is written in the 440-page report written by the diocese of Regensburg with the Enlightenment of Attorney Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger domains were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, with high plausibility "victims of surviving, 67 cathedral sparrows sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who was working in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "" "," "" "," "" "it can hold that from Domkapellmeister R. was applied in many cases forms of physical and mental violence." ""</seg>
<seg id="2906">Even at high reliability, the punishment for the pupils could also be severe.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Nevertheless, in contrast to numerous others, many victims were estimated to assert the general humanity by R. estimates and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories were connected with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann, why the final report on the failure of Mississiscandal was explained by Georg Ratzinger of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report about the" "" "Incidents of Violence" "" "is a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">For one raise many students up his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">In the other hand, he also appears as Choleriker and Perfection, who became handsome in the Öfteren is musically no top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you read the trouble and read the full 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you need to ask, why the name Georg Ratzinger must be in it at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Just eight pages dedicated to him and it is clear of any suspicion of the middle or co-knowledge in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Violence also took place at the forefront of its efficiencies outside of its active sphere.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You can reject it all if you are too late or first anchooses have to have enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the" "" "redemption" "", "" "" "Heaven" "" "and" better world "" "" was written by practically all respondents, "" "" salvation "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="2918">Thus, the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also describes him as "warm," popular "" "" correctly, "" "," "" "," "" "," "" "," "" "," "" "," "" "and" "", "the guys regularly operated with cake, biscusen and Bonbons," "" "was surrounded by the grapes of children." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority is worth over his perfectionism and its high emotions, which led to wutilient even times.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he did not only cast them with chairs and cast the keys on the ground, but also earmarked guys in the hair or ears, he had already deeply regretted and withered for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">However, to his honor it has to be said that such educational methods in the fragile time, the 1960s and 1970s, were widespread, with parents as with teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also have experienced this in a worldly school, a state Gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared with what actually comes in this report, namely the horrible sexual abuse and the violence at the forefront, are the freili Bagatellen.</seg>
<seg id="2926">There you already asks, if it is not more with his acquaintness and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, many media has just fell on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">On the Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood it, still have eivaulted.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report unloaded Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media in connection with the report a lot about the topic of abuse at the Regensburger Dommoatzen station was reported in connection with the report.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger at the final report also placed any processing or co-knowledge in terms of sexual abuse at the load?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual overgeries claims to have committed to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never tried me to speak with my father or mother," "" "said a party representative for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The true problem in the Enlightenment of sexual abuse, and is that most of the victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they trusted not even parents and siblings, then definitely not a choir director, who had been working as a collector of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do you evaluate the guinea fowls student of Ratzinger's role in regard to the abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questioned students formulate it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case, in which he would have had to suspect (Georg Ratzinger) and would have had the respective perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... also for really absurd, to assume that... Buben in urgent or clearer or rather opened, than against their parents, internatsleaders, confidentials, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">Thus the report is coming to the very clear result: "that they trusted in advance of the pupils and / or their environment, could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="2942">For sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is advisable to discuss any mitigation.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So it can't be thrown into it, not prevented him or have brought it to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to bring his good names with these conflicting crimes in connection, as it happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media was much of "violent food" at the Regensburger Cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of the "Wegener" report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Do he have to live with this approach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the great problem that in the coverage was missing and forbid was a huge melange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is exactly what is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">That is, clean up: between the suburbs and the Gymnasium of the Domestic atzen, between sexual abuse and violence as well, we say once, other penalties.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report has been treated from the time since 1945, thus from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir director of the cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole awful examining education, the cases where the child of sast teachers were regular and painted them, were all of them involved in the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen where truly scandalous states have to have.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with whom Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys only to face when they were already on the high school.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On the way, as most of the most witness, the theme of "Preschool" taboo. "</seg>
<seg id="2955">It was only happy to be coming back and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "parathis" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the grammar school?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was already discipline, but no sast violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, at the end of the report that "many victims have estimated the general humanity of R. estimates and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">There is no one who remains to have the treasuries.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report was able to define just two periods, in which it was reported by the states of the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish and began to establish its predecessors at a school where he had not worked and responsible for him (as the witness) nothing wanted to hear, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Closed Georg Ratzinger in front of the states consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of Domspatzengymnasium who even reproduced the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "this indicates that" "" "he will continue to practice the test penalty" "" "in the Vorschule" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Already in view of the danger of negative press signs.</seg>
<seg id="2966">That was, of course, as legal clarity, was illegal in Bavaria as a result of legal clarity.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before they occurred in a legal gray zone like every one of us knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">There was too heavy for him to estimate, where the affected people may have overdrive or dramatic, where really the permissible limit was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one can't say, that he could always take away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980, the test penalty was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the Gloria of Thurn and taxis claimed it is unfair that today's pedagogical standards to that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we are talking to the historian of Anachronism, "thus the danger, past to present moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">Since the princess has already quite right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this is not true of sexual abuse, who was abhable to all times, and not for what was broken in preschooling and violence against innocent children, which goes far beyond that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all a terrible and I'm glad that it finally works finally.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means to discipline and ageing, so earneon and listen to the hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Then, as physical punishment is forbidden, it also has been kept strict about it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Which picture from his Regensburger Time, Georg Ratzinger has given to you the book "My Brother of the Pope" in the talks?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Came the subject of testing also to language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it goes around the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, as the cathedral sparrows only played a side role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, in no means, I didn't forget that he led a new regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this must once again be said: without these perfectionism, without unconditional discipline, it would probably hardly been possible to form a true cultural ambassador in Europe and its musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With Keksen and Bonbons alone, one turns out of contradiligent boy once a big singer and in front of each success, on which area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What a man do you have experienced Georg Ratzinger on the talks about their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: because of work in the book and beyond, I have experienced Georg Ratzinger really well and again and again as a wonderful, humorous, basic good man, deeply believers and warm good people, from which one could not imagine that he could do only a fly somewhat a little bit.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get acquainted with how many former domestranged today, 23 years after his retirement, regularly contact him, visit him - he is almost blind - and he is like a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who didn't forgive him until today, that he once was strictly to them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domestic atzen are thanked to him today that he enriches their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always had a good, vehemently teacher - a stringent father, eat, that may be - but also a lovely respectful respectson, too which she still has seen and honor them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once more clearly: all that one would need for him, corrective methods that were at the time at the time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long been overcome that time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man, only because he is prominently and has a more prominent brother to make a medial fall into sin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">Then is the evil purpose that is behind it is obvious to be obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report, which was just published, relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the pitch command, a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria, perhaps in Germany, nobody would have to know the Regensburger Dommoatzen station, finally in peace.</seg>
