gol@@ fer lan@@ ger receives the inner pyr@@ am@@ ids
his experiences on the horse are over@@ looked .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger , with some colleagues a bit di@@ version with a ride on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Sport@@ pil@@ es &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after some minutes , the horses came to their closing ceremony , they pursued the fast gal@@ lop in the fast gal@@ lop of the feeding .
one kilometer at this temp@@ o , I have dre@@ amed .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and that the riding career ended up again .
on Saturday the best golf course of all times - 101 tournament victories - again in the vicinity of horses .
he left himself with his family over the complex of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not stack to photo .
this was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CH@@ IO .
the reason was absolutely convincing .
the German Sports@@ - Assi@@ stance to the man from An@@ hausen in the frame of a small gala the Golden Sports pyramid .
it won &apos;t be any kind of awards for the sympath@@ etic athl@@ ete .
Federal Cross Cross , Silver bay leaf , Champions Tour Player of the Year ...
even the British Queen has already ad@@ ored him .
long is the 18th winner of the inner pyr@@ am@@ ids .
in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this distinction is very much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for it is not only for spor@@ tive successes but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been supporting the offspring since decades .
and so he gave the prize money of € 25,000 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ fold U.S. master winner was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of Fame of the German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;

many of these sporting events came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the lively Society emigrated to the Spring@@ time , where the Lav@@ az@@ za prize was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the great animals .
Clin@@ t and Tr@@ um@@ ps Economic Policy in Compar@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and prevent trade agreements T@@ TP - they want both Clinton and tr@@ ump .
however , the two US presidential compet@@ itor , however , in the tax and energy policy , as well as in a basic request .
differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton under@@ stands a fundamental , more philosoph@@ ical difference .
it is about the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to stop the doubt rather small and war@@ ns , as the state of the economy harm - with tax and regulation .
Clinton would best@@ ow the economy to death and regul@@ ate death , he says .
however , himself would be quite different , claimed to be Tr@@ ump .
he will drive ra@@ ges massi@@ vely , and he makes himself strong tax reform with lower tax rates strongly - for individuals and for businesses .
Clinton says : the state has to fulfil certain tasks , he has dis@@ advant@@ age@@ ous opportunities and needs money .
therefore , the taxes for the rich would be increased , she says .
both are very close to the theme infrastructure .
to be invested in the must , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say nearly similar .
the democratic applic@@ ants announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ ach@@ y @-@ wing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
so on Tr@@ ump , so many internal discussions could come .
significant are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal plants and return the coal promotion in the USA .
oil extraction is also possible to termin@@ ate the climate agreement in Paris in order to termin@@ ate the climate agreement .
in contrast to the investment program , Clinton also aims to strengthen renewable energies and demands : &quot; a country will make the super@@ power of clean energies and create millions jobs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only with the infrastructure - even at international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from one another .
T@@ PP , the exp@@ o @-@ fish trade agreement , do not want to sign .
at the same time , both the U.S. do not want to isol@@ ate the international trade , but simply protect American jobs better .
they should then be paid better , ur@@ ges around Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7,@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger strike .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be r@@ ins@@ ed , then he says he will not be changed .
but the great discussion of the coming months is probably not likely to develop the control policy of the two camps .
on one side is Tr@@ ump , who wants to escape the economy and citizens to spur growth .
his critics keep him before , that the budget deficit would only be bigger .
on the other hand , Clinton , who wants to demand at least of the rich wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution .
escape : &quot; any vol@@ at@@ ted woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone , almost already for everyday life .
if they arrive in Germany , they often are trau@@ mat@@ ised .
a house offers refuge .
four women are sitting in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby that is at most one year old .
one has put her small son into the arm .
he gu@@ essed with great eyes curious in the room .
his mother star@@ red on the table top .
until they notice that she is observed .
they sm@@ iling and kissed the little ones .
the scene works normally .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is part of the Managing Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social assistance in Bavaria , and deals with the topic of women on the flight .
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in Munich north in one of the few de@@ centr@@ ated women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs made the establishment together with Pro Familia and Munich &apos;s wom@@ an@@ ism .
it was not long ago .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
males don &apos;t exist - even as visitors .
the exception is an wax before the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every woman who comes here , has made experiences with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are polit@@ ically persecuted , because torture or death are threatened , or because their families send them as a reward to Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at women , other reasons for the flight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Many steal themselves secretly because they don &apos;t see any other away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her hom@@ eland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced to see , honor , slavery , or forced pro@@ stitution .
it drives them away .
on the flight this goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the tu@@ g for a bottle of water require a sexual action , isn &apos;t a rarity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who think that the end soon as they are ank@@ ets in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr .
in this case , all women in refugee camps are often considered as min@@ as and mis@@ used worse .
this leads to that about 90 per cent of women who live in the north of the north , trau@@ mat@@ ised , estimates them .
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot;
many women are so usual that they don &apos;t say anything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they trusted not to speak openly about the earth because the shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often do not help to help you need more accommodations only for them , calls B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , seven District gover@@ ns are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question whether they live from a similar project as in Munich in its jurisdiction , some will answer with no .
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz region and Ober@@ fran@@ ken there are no something that governments did not exist .
in Schw@@ aben alone , women are not accommodated in separate women , Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Press@@ ing pre@@ ver of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central fran@@ ken there are houses in some common floors or own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament demands that women must be accommodated separately from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a study which was published for the Committee , it is : &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated . &quot;
&quot; lack of privacy or are being accommodated together , it may come to - for@@ warding - violence against women . &quot;
above all the rooms should be separately accessible and accessible for women , stands in the study .
how much the women will feel of this protection requirements , one can read the rush , which is in the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it has been spoken , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily make a second house .
assist@@ ants strike : requirements for new working struggle
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; representatives of the assist@@ ants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; union members &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their dispute regarding their disp@@ utes regarding a new contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has demanded its entire Council as from beginning of September more working measures .
the J@@ DC told that it was given to minister to the concerns regarding the contract .
assistant and medical studies have been voted in July over the re@@ jection of a contract that was agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members elected on Thursday evening on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; be@@ ak @-@ quiet &quot; to problems that the treaty was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Who has voted the J@@ DC Member of the Board to complete the proposed new contract with the proposed new contract for all aspects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a response to the silence of the government , J@@ DC Management Board today made a formal request to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to start a running program of es@@ cal@@ ating work campaign that starts at the beginning of September .
the disp@@ utes ar@@ ising that the assistance of assistance in this year were six times , the first total explo@@ res in the history of the N@@ HS .
the Director of the BM@@ A Assist@@ ive Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana joined the election to re@@ jection the agreed contract conditions that were recommended by the BM@@ A .
he distributed BM@@ A members during the sessions , which took place before the vote by 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants and medical instruments , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the health minister Jeremy Hunt , that the contract for doctors in England would be instit@@ uted .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of outer sides &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and pro@@ claim the official end of the eight months of the war and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish opposite to the gold @-@ gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace in reception , I can not leave me of inv@@ as@@ ure that Ankara wants to make them reconciliation .
there were the stroke , yes .
but Put@@ to the smile worked nar@@ row@@ ly and it felt hardly warmth , even for his return conditions .
on the other hand , Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an , on the other hand , said to his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin , according to a report about five times .
I could not count it anymore .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but can even improve even better .
on the next day , a newspaper described that Erd@@ og@@ an would have been en@@ ligh@@ tened , as it would never happen to happen .
his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite to me .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cooling showed that the Russian president of Russia had not forgotten .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first , what he mentioned in his introductory remarks : the surplus of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow reaction to the time was w@@ ut@@ ated .
Putin told , and accused Ankara to be back in the back .
it was even bigger because it was committed by a boy@@ friend .
the Vet@@ eg@@ s will re@@ build again , if not even impossible .
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months the state @-@ controlled media led a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
it seemed to be at once , when the Turks were able to bear all the gu@@ ilt .
the alleg@@ ations of senior civil servants have benef@@ ited that Erd@@ og@@ ans had benef@@ ited his own family from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria , which will be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has fought this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St. Petersburg the official message was that it is time to look back to the front .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the exc@@ use of the President Erd@@ og@@ an who wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind win .
for Ankara , the advantages of an arm@@ ist@@ ice is clear by hand .
Erd@@ og@@ an needs all friends , which he can get after the last month in a failed coup d &apos;@@ etat of almost his ministry .
he repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey also sh@@ aken him .
but there is also economic moti@@ fs .
the Russian sanctions went hard on Turkey - particularly the ban of bat@@ ches , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number is decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , travel activities and charter companies will be facilit@@ ated when the flights will be resum@@ ed .
they count on a late ais@@ les of the Mediterranean Sea .
this week , the state television set up fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports will be allowed again .
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ c@@ i formulated this way : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is w@@ ailing on the west , since the reaction of power tried to consider power than weak answer .
coming to the EU &apos;s accession to the EU accession negotiations and Putin , the long @-@ lasting increase in the EU accession negotiations and Putin is to reduce the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the west .
in Ankara , the Russian State Leader won a bonus that he called for the elected coup d &quot; é@@ tat for the elected State organs .
this is well @-@ noticed for Moscow a self @-@ understanding , which himself has a deeper fear of reg@@ im@@ e@@ aval .
the summit meeting in this gl@@ itter@@ ing palace of the sea allowed Russia and Turkey , one , as it described to me an analy@@ st , &quot; Alliance of outer side &quot; : two countries , which are cast off from the west and po@@ or@@ ly treated , and therefore serve .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently delivered the role as a peace block , but where Russia and Turkey support various parties .
it might be drawing that after almost three hours of first seminars on the press conference , they said that they didn &apos;t attack the theme once .
the President of Turkey for@@ ged it deliber@@ ately on a question about her differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ize this .
there is no clear con@@ sens@@ us in front of where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open host@@ ilities - and in view of the potenti@@ als for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey &apos;s Russian fighter jet fuel - it is certainly better to talk about two Heads of State at least .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland are no longer available
according to the Bank &apos;s Board of Directors , the R@@ BS brand is to be reduced to a backup role in accordance with the Board of Directors .
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan opened the BBC Scotland that joined the Bank R@@ BS with the global amb@@ itions of the bank .
since then , the bank has been dist@@ ressed since they had to be saved and saved almost eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are used in this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds in sponsor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Rug@@ by to Wimbledon winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to support more national brands in the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , de@@ centr@@ alised headquarters and markets to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for the private customer that will get more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ WAN was inter@@ viewed during a tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
he divided the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B is being employed at our Invest@@ or brand , as well as the brand , among which our employees will be employed , since we are now going to become a Bank of brands . &quot;
when the bank became a global brand , R@@ BS has been used to global brand .
I say now that we don &apos;t track any global goals , but local targets .
each of these brands will be in their own communities for something completely different and our employees are working among these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already said that there will be no longer a Six Nations Spon@@ sor@@ ing , and that it will increase the perc@@ ep@@ ability of the various brands in his sports Spon@@ sor@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to develop the brands of brands , as we are focusing on the interior ( we asked ) to make this too a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the board of directors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very z@@ yn@@ ical 3 years ago when we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands .
but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can restore this brand again , so I think that time has come .

Russia Putin feu@@ ding Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin was unexpected in expect@@ edly his staff of Chief Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was part of the nar@@ row@@ est trust of Putin for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed to the special representative for environmental and transport .
in a position of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it is that Putin has ordered the release Ivan@@ ov@@ s of his duties as chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who had been on the deputy chairman since 2012 , was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
in 1972 , he was born in Tallinn , and graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the embassy in Tokyo .
on the site of Kre@@ m@@ lin it is called ( in Russian ) that he later became a protocol of protocol and head of government agencies .
he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot;
I think it is the most important role of the government to support your activity as head of state law and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov was asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convincing the sm@@ iling faces ?
this step was mysteri@@ ously in Moscow .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was a long time of the nar@@ row@@ est trust Vladimir Putin and works as he was for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men of the country .
in a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast@@ ed on TV in television , both men claimed that Chief of Staff went back on their own request .
but despite the music for the cameras , there are only few of them - especially now , shortly before the legislative elections .
is this the result of a kind of power to combat ?
this is no one that nobody knows .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who once again pra@@ ising the potential president to lead the Russian environmental policy - joined the great sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism once again .
in his remarks on Putin who are quoted on the site of the Kre@@ m@@ lin said Ivan@@ ov &quot; It is true that I asked you to trust this very complicated post in early 2012 - one could almost say - and to trust it for four years .
as it represents , I have been chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration since four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and it was a former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , he was appointed the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy .
as Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he confi@@ ded to most confi@@ ded .
once , Ivan@@ ov was accepted that Ivan@@ ov could lead to Russia into the second term of office in Russia because there would have been a third mandate of Putin against the Constitution .

ri@@ dd@@ les around the fish that landed in the Garden in Ban@@ ff
a population of Ban@@ ff called for the identification of fish help , which appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .

Que@@ ens@@ ing Cross@@ ing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project is expected to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the north deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ing Cross@@ ing with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is connected with Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four se@@ al@@ ings of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cover &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which is the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete , as well as 46 tra@@ ilers .
the project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
at the site today , K@@ eit@@ h Brown was a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
he said , &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment when the construction of the Que@@ ens@@ y Cross@@ ing .
we are all witnesses of an engineering crafts@@ manship in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the removal between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and bridge deck is a heat activity that require extremely precise tolerances for the fit .
in total , almost 79 % of the total bridge is at their place and the last section of the deck is today in Ros@@ y@@ th a bet@@ ong@@ ation for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to the bridge .
Michael Martin , project leader of For@@ th Cross@@ ing Bridge Construc@@ tors &quot; said : &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project .
with this fantastic project , the seal of tr@@ end@@ setting high and deep construction is in this fantastic project .
after installation of the last street cover and its connection with the Nord@@ tur@@ m@@ deck &apos;s installation , we had to close the even existing gap on the North or country side .
this was reached by pulling the northern bridge bridge 700 millimeter south .
this was a massive and very busy activity .
massive , since the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be moved with an incline of approximately 3 % .
the tolerances , as the tolerances , that the team works , were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters .
fortunately everything was very good .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have &quot; happiness still alive &quot;
three men have &quot; luck to be alive , &quot; after they were cast out of the fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T al@@ ert , after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
the three men had difficulties to swim in safety , while her boat moved from their own power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we looked like the ship at its proximity to turned and set the worst before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds ble@@ w the boat except its range , until we left the water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were res@@ cu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , during the third man at the age of 60 and was found at a Bo@@ je without li@@ fe@@ jacket .
they were all aboard the coast area and were brought back to the rescue station
Mr. Jones said : &quot; the three men who were cast into the water have been un@@ hurt , and to be alive still alive .
the boot engine had a stop@@ stop@@ pl@@ one that dis@@ sol@@ ving the boat by the Bo@@ ots of the person to control the boat .
someone has w@@ aged over these men today .
seriously wounded - man st@@ ow on his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously wounded .
as the police hur@@ ried , the 50 year old had the key to get the apartment to get his personal things .
instead , the alcohol cut the clothes of his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend .
when they came into the apartment , he moved twice to them .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured at hand and in the body .
the police could determine the perpet@@ rators .
during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothing of his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend , he called his mother .
this al@@ arms therefore became his sister .
together with her life , the 45 year old wanted to calm their brother .
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
this is why she went with their hab@@ end@@ anger@@ ed house .
on the road they met the ex @-@ life @-@ risk of the man .
when the two women bed the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old took his sister to the side and hold its ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend .
who builds Braun@@ schwei@@ gs favorable apartments ?
the SPD and founding my : investors have to be much stronger in the future .
how do you react to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick has lost nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; manual concept &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the next rat@@ chet &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but stri@@ fe is programmed .
in the first line it is about the question : who should actually build the favorable apartments ?
a rule is missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD Group CEO Christoph Brat@@ mann writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking forward to the Green Party : who wants to build urban areas in the future , 20 percent of all apartments have to exhibit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the favourable apartments can also be created in stock .
the big dispute in the town hall was however , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you want to build investors in private areas ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to investors investors at least 10 percent , but as possible as 20 percent of dwellings as a social apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new municipal housing program , which will cost millions of costs and will be financed for incenti@@ ves .
the problem , so viol@@ mann : &quot; there are currently no agreement between the fra@@ ctions . &quot;
the CDU would like to make investors as much pres@@ crip@@ tions .
the lin@@ ke still wants hardness levels for investors .
regardless of that , viol@@ mann , h@@ ort itself a deep@@ ening of the situation in the housing market .
the conversion concept is implemented , that will ensure additional tasks in building management .
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the specialists .
but the program is not yet full : for the approximately 1260 new apartments that should be built @-@ in .
how does one compare the loss of another around 1300 favorable apartments whose promotion will run out in the next few years ?
by the year 2020 alone there will be 500 apartments .
to prevent this , the plan@@ etary spokes@@ person Nicole Palm , should now be bought out of the town now .
in addition , the apartment would have to be thought back to get back to the price .
this is possible in the Western city .
a problem would solve the problem .
because in the West@@ stadt run down the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments you could get there back to the price connection for cheap apartments .
only : we don &apos;t want the owner , the building companies do not want .
because the number of social dwellings in the West town is dra@@ stically increased , one is the goal of the so @-@ called flow .
a concentration of social weak in just a few parts will no longer give it .
the gre@@ ens anticip@@ ate that there will be a movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a vast majority , the CDU with the boat &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have concentrated on more buildings for one family homes .
but what does not mean that not yet a compromise can be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt after health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating how the world changed .
that teen@@ ager and child for playing no more go outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time to spend your free time on screens , has been cited in the last decade of many .
in Pok@@ em@@ on Go it is therefore to pick up people from the sofa and to be active .
at the beginning , the time on screen was limited to video games and most recently limited to smartphones .
therefore it &apos;s great to see that technology and activities are not connected to the outside .
I clicked on the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later it emerged as a cartoon animation , game cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
as many phenom@@ ena of popularity fell the interest in the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July .
the market launch in other countries has been moved through the massive demand that over@@ load the server .
within few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users as Tin@@ ym@@ s and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players go back to outside and seek after Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons , which are followed with a GPS and once they were once found , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( on a screenshot on the phone ) or &quot; captured &quot; .
one generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the W@@ ahn and j@@ ump@@ ed for the search of the sofa .
in the USA , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that sets the &quot; average &quot; person every day .
Cardi@@ ff , an app for Apple Watch , which followed 35,000 users , divided the Washington Post recently with that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of people who followed every day 30 minutes , rose from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company doesn &apos;t know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it looks just the raw data for the auction .
many public awareness campaigns for health , people want to bring in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to come &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to come from the sofa , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; every day active in exchange ears , because many public messages are bo@@ di@@ ly bor@@ ing and come from people who look like . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , sport cannot be evaluated .
those who do regularly drives sports , reduces its chances to climb on cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of advantages that is too long to carry them here .
but the wonderful at Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that people brings people to do something in the open , that it is fun to them .
thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sun@@ shine as well as fun .
some people close to the hunt for new friends .
as always there are m@@ ür@@ ric gam@@ ble that must always compl@@ ain about something .
and yes , someone might run against a door .
what should it be ?
it has a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit already had to follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to play sport as it does this game .
the new will lose his ri@@ z and the use will be re@@ charged with time .
due to Pok@@ em@@ ons success , there will be more games to un@@ ite apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and will help many people in the hunt , active , f@@ itter and heal@@ th@@ ier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the h@@ ype .
Simone Bil@@ es is at all that imm@@ un .
dynamic on the j@@ umping horse .
effortlessly on the bar .
stunning on the ground .
brilliant on full line .
and now the Olympic champion now .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday for campaigns and enlarged the gap between themselves and the rest of the world before all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
their overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly before the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; -@@ clubteam kam@@ er@@ adin A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal in Ali@@ ya Sol@@ af@@ ina .
the American Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ net@@ ting at the Schwe@@ be@@ bal@@ m during the individual campaigns of women during the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexual American player , which wins a multi @-@ campaign , and a total of the fifth , while they had their reputation to be the best of their generation or even at all .
it broke out in tears , as their final result was shown and their long journey took place at this moment .
this success represents them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps who brought her sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es domin@@ ates the last three years , 15 world championship med@@ ail@@ len - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises , that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary L@@ ou Ret@@ ton from her said that she has ever seen &quot; the best gymn@@ ast , which I ever seen . &quot;
it was expected to be a final exam in Brazil , a competition that went not so very between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , rather , rather , between her and a load over@@ sized expectations .
do not return with a hand@@ ful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered as a dis@@ appointment .
the American Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man revol@@ ve , after they each have won gold and silver in the single multi @-@ campaign of women in the gymn@@ asts of the Olympic Summer 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es took the first medal in Tuesday , while on the f@@ arewell party , the team coordinator at Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi served as a expul@@ sion .
although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted , during its long distance to the top , never stopped the future , that is not really true .
part of its floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is aimed at Latin American music which would match the home outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio .
this is not acci@@ dental .
this girl , which adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school trip to the gymn@@ asium , was trained in Bo@@ or@@ man .
since the summer of 2013 , she has lost no event competition for more , a winning series that will hold so long as it wishes .
even if patterns led slightly through two fil@@ ming , the image has sli@@ pped .
sulph@@ ur@@ ks and Bo@@ ats - in which Bil@@ es holds the world championship title - lau@@ rel .
they returned again with 15,@@ 433 on the sulph@@ ide again - and there was another 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
Ra@@ is@@ man im@@ pover@@ ished them gently than they were anticipated - a pure form@@ ality - and tears flow@@ ed on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue yel@@ lowing , as the vision , which once was described in their collective book to reality .
the output of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a ven@@ geance for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal was in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke in Must@@ af@@ ina .
this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team capit@@ als which is called &quot; O@@ ma &quot; by the Americans .
after their occupation , she threw the audience of K@@ us@@ sh@@ y , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes appeared without doubt .
what figure affects , so the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has become a very new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims killed in serial mur@@ der@@ y during music during the car
according to the police report , which were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl shot , who arrived in one of the most foolish attacks since a decade in the first standard mur@@ der@@ fall by Phoenix , while they were in the car and heard music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked to the car , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ rated eight shots of a hand @-@ fire weapon , while it stood on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , to read in the report .
the police shared that the triple mur@@ ders didn &apos;t have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y anything since the attack@@ ers did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 that took possession of an adult victims .
Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting undry had led the investig@@ ator to become a closer look at whether they are connected with four previous attacks .
in total , mainly in His@@ pan@@ ic residential neighbor@@ hoods in nine out of nine months were killed and two more injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential neighborhood in front of a house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared Howard der K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is believed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to have the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to their injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for her to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the fo@@ undry which had an empty @-@ up truck for half an hour before the triple murder , and from that it was assumed that it was the work of the standard mur@@ ders .
investigations found Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and secured a ball out of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ organisms : &quot; it is better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves the singing , toys and naturally his mother .
but like the least of his aging , Edmund Micro@@ zep@@ hal@@ ie , the result of a genetic disorders that knew his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during their pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought , I did not create it .
I do not create this .
I did not let me down .
what is not correct -- of course , one has left it , &quot; she said .
your husband Vincent and her was told that Edmund will never recognize them under circumstances , and that he may not survive once .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to al@@ ise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know that the people still knew , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Edmund can run with help to help .
Edmund could neither cra@@ w@@ l up to his third year , neither cra@@ w@@ ling nor talk yet .
but he makes slow progress .
it can run with support and cycling .
he loves to play with his two brothers and singing .
Elizabeth shows the drawing language that Edmund holds me something before &quot; Please have conceived . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bring it the drawing language to &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there is no typical character language -- says she . Edmund invented some signs alone .
Mikro@@ zep@@ hal@@ ie has a variety of causes : genetic as at Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as Mas@@ ern or Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus during pregnancy .
symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of infected with the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to reminds on the emotional price of an unknown future .
I asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they really don &apos;t know .
I &apos;ve been asked for a long time longer after the forecast , because I don &apos;t expect that someone really can really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has caused a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
it is better .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

why do we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I fore@@ seen to me under the Women &apos;s Olympi@@ ad in the Tower and that is out of more than a reason .
I &apos;ve been doing so dominant at every summer Olympi@@ ad since 1984 and the United States were never so dominant .
and second : this team has three gymn@@ asts , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren , &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired for many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din is and Madison Ko@@ cian , which is cath@@ olic , makes all proud .
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has been the black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic female presence at the top of this sports art .
in the last four years the number one was one of the female gymn@@ ast@@ ers a A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
that shows strength .
in the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprise Olympics in and the Americas .
now the world was able to be a witness of the incredible power of three times world champion Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they were unexpected , but most @-@ known gy@@ ma@@ st@@ ics rout@@ ines .
on Thursday , Simone was awarded the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osexu@@ als American , who won gold in an individual combined event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but they do not see turn@@ around throughout the country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie put all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison , to create it to the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five &quot; because the next Olympi@@ ans have only four gymn@@ asts in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a train@@ ee .
but the reality looks like that there are a expensive sport and Turner at first line in private gym , which are calculated by parents , accounting for training , planning , travel - clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainer and their Turner and families ) . the list is possible to continue .
the majority of this turn@@ around are in we@@ al@@ thy suburbs , which can support the business .
in these clubs , Turner their entire training and this is for families a expensive and long @-@ term commitment .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer by Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer by Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both have trained their athletes , since they started with the gymn@@ ast .
we need to in@@ numer@@ able the municipalities of Au@@ n countless , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a great and easy @-@ to @-@ reach gym .
I founded my turn@@ key collection of 20 years .
with my events we have offered free and affordable rooms in Harlem for more than 15,000 people ( mainly black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymn@@ asts that earn the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sport art .
Tur@@ ns develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body and hard work , discipline and destination for the spirit .
this combination offers vital advantages for health as well as for the school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymn@@ asts and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in the sport , especially for girls .
this is so exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the Olympic Team gold and thank you to start her way many young girls with different background to begin their way , healthy , strong and successful young women .
assist@@ ants would like to organise further strikes , after having received Jeremy Hun@@ ts proposal
the ministers hopes to termin@@ ate the dispute over the changes due to the adoption of a re@@ formed treaty with the functioning of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of 37@@ ,000 assist@@ ants , who made with an election , refused him .
in July , Hunt plans to introduce the contract , and said that the N@@ HS was involved in an &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; which would be harmful to the employees and patients .
the first assistance of assistance should receive a new contract that contains changes to night and weekend work to improve care times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A committee on the last night in a communication with : &quot; assistant doctors have moved to the proposed contract after serious concerns , in particular that it is to heat the current account crisis , and it is advis@@ able to treat all doctors . &quot;
at only eight weeks , which still remain until the first group of doctors under the new contract must be made progress and the time runs out .
efforts by the BM@@ A on the solution of disp@@ utes caused by discussions to participate in the government and sometimes on o@@ hren@@ ic silence .
this was the word of a speaking , Jeremy Hunt had only made last month about it , that his door would always be off@@ ended .
&quot; Jeremy Hunt must act now to raise the in@@ firm@@ ness and concerns the concerns of the assistance of Assi@@ stance . &quot;
if he do not do this , the assistant doctors have made clear that they are ready to perform further labour measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a boost of almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appoint@@ ments , since n@@ urses and experts were invited to allow doctors to grant a strike @-@ post@@ oper@@ able cover .
the ministers decided to end the dispute over the modifications by an adoption of the re@@ formed Treaty with the functioning of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A would like to be a better week@@ day re@@ mun@@ eration for the 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants that are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director of the N@@ HS employee , called for the assistance of assistance to the strike .
Mor@@ cars said : &quot; working struggle with only little , but already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , nurs@@ ing and their families only wor@@ ries , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
in the last two months , we talked to the Com@@ mit of Assist@@ ants and with the Ministry of Health as well as other minist@@ ries , concerns the concerns regarding the fore@@ m@@ und@@ ance and of the W@@ hist@@ ori@@ low@@ ings .
the employer trusted that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as aston@@ ishment , flexibility for training , training activities , mutual recognition of education , training activities , mutual recognition of education , education , health Education England and the Ministry of Health related to compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .

culture of Political Cor@@ respon@@ dence to flour@@ ish in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year on request of a governmental report on corruption from the Office
a culture of the Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has resulted in a widespread election in Muslim congregations will be igno@@ red as a devastating government report today .
the former member of Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es , the Police , Election Ob@@ ach@@ ers and Rath@@ en@@ sees to have igno@@ red evidence of voters regarding eth@@ nic@@ ities regarding eth@@ nic@@ ities and religion . &quot;
the former Minister of Integration and Municipal Council , which now is a ant@@ aneous inf@@ alli@@ um , said that the police force should be permitted out of religious moti@@ ves so bad that it should be permitted to protect the police out of elec@@ tors , in order to protect the voters .
he recommends that voters should lead a identification with themselves to prove your identity in the elections .
at present , a voters call only his name and address .
the report suggests , no longer ink to the finger of a person apply , if they vote their elec@@ toral voice to prevent any one cho@@ oses twice .
W@@ hist@@ leb@@ ars should receive more protection , Sir Eric says .
it demands that the press should have access to the community documents and decisions by non @-@ official commission@@ ers or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only against election , but it should also protect the municipal government in front of the spread of corruption and financial consultants , which comes to protect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by the Dow@@ ning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets Election Sc@@ and@@ als in the East of London .
last year , a Special Court decided that the reig@@ ning Mayor Lut@@ on for Rah@@ man to corrupt and illeg@@ itim@@ ate practices of his ministry should be reflected .
the court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim species , &quot; and that he had brought his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bi@@ en@@ an@@ cies to silence .
Rah@@ man should have led his campaign on the basis that it was the most important duty of Muslims that would choose to choose . &quot;
up to 300 voices were either des@@ per@@ ately or the result of an im@@ pover@@ ishment , when someone cho@@ oses another person when someone else .
Sir Eric said that it was in the whole country of evidence for fr@@ aud .
in particular , in particular al@@ ar@@ ming to the fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent stamp code - the older members of the Muslim community should have been able to vote a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , depicted , made several recommendations to clean the elec@@ toral system , including the joining of the identity to prove the identity
in his report it is said : &quot; it was proof that pressure on the needy members of some ethnic min@@ orities have been exercised , especially women and young people , in order to choose among the will of the El@@ der , in particular communities with pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ic or Albanian background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was concerns that ... state institutions such as such behavior was ignor@@ ant of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; polit@@ ically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; belie@@ fs regarding eth@@ nic@@ ities and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric spoke to 50 recommendations in order to clean the system , including the ban , that political activists will work to stop the vote . &quot;
the report , which is drawn up by Ther@@ esa May , demands also the har@@ der registration checks to prevent the election directory to immig@@ ration and social skills .
options : consider that voters want to ask for your identification prior to your selection .
do not use distances on the finger of a person when they put up their voice to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice .
systematic review checks concerning the nationality of a person to ensure that they are entitled .
a three @-@ year limit on applications on an automatic brie@@ fing selection .
prohibition to edit political activists and envelop@@ es from the letter of writing .
the police give the powers to set shut@@ down around elec@@ ts stations .
a change of Law , which facilit@@ ates an indictment due to the repression of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Representative Act 1983 ) .
photographer in elec@@ toral stations .
requirement that only English may be used in elec@@ toral stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training , to ensure that the employees will typically continue to go to the elec@@ toral cabin alone .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amaz@@ ingly &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets there was no penalty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elec@@ toral court has Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy to corrupt and illeg@@ itim@@ ate practices due to a lit@@ igation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was pleaded guilty on the basis of a number of reasons due to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings .
he critic@@ ises the effective &quot; Ab@@ h@@ ak@@ controls &quot; of elec@@ toral Plan departments of the Rath@@ en@@ feld .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
our land is wearing a proud heritage as the mother of par@@ liam@@ ents a proud inheritance , but the spread of election amounted and le@@ ad@@ ation of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger from Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ als in Rio
fans of the Olympic Games 2016 in Rio include this week via the French cycling team Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot out of the edge and band who has proved to be an impressive double @-@ successor of the Du@@ chess in Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ on@@ ik@@ in is not the only one to have gold fighting Ath@@ let , who has its own famous double @-@ gän@@ ger - at least not when you give the social media faith .
in honour of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that at the time on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a list of Olympi@@ oni@@ als which feature more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood &apos;s most famous .
the fighter and the Wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared to Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since his childhood .
apart from K@@ ates double @-@ singer on the bicycle track , many people are moving on the internet , like a certain arch@@ ery of the Di@@ d@@ ym@@ us of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o .
the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a tower on Twitter , after pictures where he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ secretly .
in fact , the arch@@ ery received the mad@@ ness to the social media with and gave to hear that he had already seen since his childhood , he looks like Leo .
&quot; I myself see not a big simil@@ arity , with the exception of the visual hair@@ y , &quot; told Bra@@ dy of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is an ast@@ oun@@ ding guy , so I hate it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will still have no more in the center : the elabor@@ ating simil@@ arity between the British wide @-@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .
the Russian Tour@@ ner@@ in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its large , expres@@ sive eyes should be a twin @-@ singer for Cub@@ an American singer Gloria E@@ ste@@ fan .
and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh is compared with G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
one speed higher : this user is the view that Nathan the &quot; athlet@@ ic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor is
a further continued comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , which has similar heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medals in Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points out more than just the sunny skin and bl@@ on@@ ous hair@@ s like the act@@ ress Ann@@ al@@ yn@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Adrian Adrian of fans were att@@ ested to the &quot; athlet@@ ic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : soccer star hope solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar fac@@ ial shape and eyes
not the only thing : a Twitter user was very happy about that others fell the simil@@ ar@@ ities as well
theory placed in the room : according to this user there is a reason for the simil@@ arity of the Pa@@ ares perhaps a reason
a Twitter U@@ ser@@ in declared their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the internet think that Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter is almost identical . &quot;
in fact , the U.S. soccer star hope solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar fac@@ ial shape and eyes .
another popular Ker@@ ry Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that by the act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney and gold med@@ alli@@ sts in the Tur@@ ns Gab@@ by Douglas , which resem@@ bles her own beautiful , broad smile , which resem@@ bles the Bring It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regre@@ t it correctly that these statements were made and that it was possible to show them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Thursday morning , Mac@@ Donald was in the broadcast and tried to justi@@ fy his re@@ mark , saying that it was not his intention to support them as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to leave me for the commentary , which I made after the women &apos;s cre@@ ator in the C@@ BC Olympics , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I have moved on the performance of s@@ wimm@@ ers and not to them as a person . &quot;
of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was inten@@ tional , and I &apos;m sorry for me . &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark &apos;s distur@@ bed over woman who tast@@ ed in the middle of the business
the buyer did not know where they should see when a woman went out of clothes in the midst of a pri@@ mark to try sub @-@ p@@ ants .
in order to merge the situation , they were numbered , as they looked , and laid them back into the shelf .
they continued and tast@@ ed four pairs of under@@ p@@ ants in a store at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , on .
the Pri@@ mark business in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , in which the woman tast@@ ed the p@@ ants before they put back to the shelf .
one mother of two children , J@@ enny David@@ son , who had been at the same time in the shop , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , &quot; she moved back and moved the shop without something to buy . &quot;
she said , &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot;
in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of substr@@ ate from the out@@ lay , over@@ laid their own r@@ ots and p@@ ants , and tried them .
&quot; she did not try to find a little discre@@ et place to do it - she simply stood there , fre@@ ch as Oskar . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone went out , when they returned to the p@@ ants , who didn &apos;t like to know it when they returned to the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three other under@@ p@@ ants before she finally decided that you did not know nothing else and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she seemed not to distur@@ b that they observed any one or more about the person who would buy the under@@ p@@ ants in circumstances which she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s David@@ son , 33 who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how contra@@ di@@ ct that someone would take shelter with home , who had a second person who had not been washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday morning .
Ms. David@@ son said , &quot; As soon as I got together , the employees have tried to draw the clothes from the sale after she went - what is exactly the same . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate it , going out to go home with a new pair of p@@ ants , and find out that another woman had her and returned and not washed them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is part of the incident , who occurred on Tuesday 9th August in our branch in Folk@@ stone , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a before tru@@ ce
the world outside is a hazardous place but this video from D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a little saf@@ er for you .
we talked with Rh@@ on Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to move with armed rob@@ bers on the distance .
regardless of whether you get from the front or from behind it will show you this video as you drive for your th@@ iev@@ es .
if you turn back from behind , then you should turn back as first , so that you can see your attack@@ ers and go out of the line , &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
take the weapon between your fore@@ arm and your shoulder before you beat him with your free ell@@ bow .
then beat him with the kne@@ e into the l@@ ath and turn , while the attack@@ ers are cr@@ ushed out of pain , the weapon from his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move it down while they turn the weapon on him .
if attack@@ ers are near , the technique is similar - move your body from the line , take the weapon and turn it so that the attack@@ ers cannot shoot .
move at the same time the weight on the weapon and beat the attack@@ ers on the chest , then turn the weapon from its handle before moving back and turn the weapon on him .
sounds hard ?
watch the video to see how it gets Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that it is at a rob@@ ber@@ y on the saf@@ est , your money is sufficient - unless you are no Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ masters .
Reis@@ er Ian Wright for a guide of his tongue to the dirty places of Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ mining the immune system and wor@@ ger@@ ef@@ lex of serious testing by taking some of the most dirty and most enchanting places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and it@@ aut@@ or Ian Wright , 51 , from Suff@@ olk will lead its way to a bill , a rail@@ ing at the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a bri@@ bes to a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resistance of its immune system .
in front of the im@@ pregn@@ ation of each object , it used a lumin@@ ometer to show and show us what he is going to let .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; brought some surprising results in daylight .
the thought to de@@ pressing a train toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , can be completely im@@ pul@@ sive , but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright said with doctors and medical specialists on the promotion of gut bacteria and its own health .
fortunately nothing left what he ab@@ sent , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. Wright has been known to test the resistance of his gut by going through the world , as well as wonderful things as well as wonderful things .
from public funds to train stations to the flush buttons of toilets , the task presented his immune system definitely under one sample
in the film he said : &quot; as a child I was relatively in@@ wor@@ ried about my health and I put all possible things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and sl@@ ud@@ water . &quot;
in the film he was justified for his call .
the only thing that he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its pro@@ stit@@ ches showed a L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ry number of more than 4000 units .
in comparison , the l@@ umin@@ omet@@ ry number is fresh@@ ly washed hands less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to ref@@ res@@ h after their l@@ umin@@ omet@@ ry value of over 4000 units , while fresh washed hands have a little less than 60 .
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number in different places such as the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it comes to the worst , which I smo@@ ked in a toilet near &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing to dirt than that !
I &apos;m not an@@ cho@@ red here , because it is indoor here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company has appro@@ ached Mr. Wright with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us that contains both Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illi and vitamin C and D to support the support of intest@@ inal bacteria and the immune system .
vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer the consumer really something new .
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biotics .
we led the Crazy Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings led with them that we said , &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
it states that interest in intest@@ inal health is to be a global phenomenon
instead of just over the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of the intest@@ inal health and how it is associated with the immune system .
growing interest in the intest@@ inal health is a global phenomenon and with documentary film we could provide more information on an interesting way .
I think that the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ or !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the direction of the film , added : &quot; let me say , &quot; I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had tast@@ ed some of the things I had instructed to him as the ek@@ y Russian toilet that will be shown in the movie . &quot;
of course , there were things where it was easier to bring them Ian , and others , in which this was quite difficult .
I &apos;m glad that we have recorded some of these dirty le@@ es on the film . &quot;

A@@ social Family destro@@ ys Del@@ og@@ ation social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
a regular family left their social apartment after a del@@ og@@ ation with a damage of £ 50,000 , because they had terrorist terror in their neigh@@ bors .
T@@ anya sk@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were cast after a long list of complaints from her property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were removed from their property , sho@@ cked staff of the housing estate which were property in an ir@@ repair condition .
the walls were broken up , ra@@ ging holes were torn down , gar@@ bage was decorated on the floors and gra@@ ff@@ iti on the walls .
the family moved lightly and it is assumed that they now lives in private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y , who works for the house management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she is feared to repair the apartment .
she said , &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare and I am the view that people don &apos;t want to live in this way .
there are many things to take into account since this property is probably considered as beautiful part of Corn@@ walls .
the family is inf@@ am@@ ous and their reputation is also available .
the pair had three sons , which were inter@@ viewed in the apartment and the police said that the terror had added that the family had added , road f@@ umes with bas@@ eb@@ all@@ ure , in@@ timi@@ date of people , drug abuse , drugs , and exc@@ essive cry , spreading and flu@@ kes .
el@@ sk@@ el@@ don , 47 , whose name stood on the rental agreement , got an arrangement for the same behaviour in June .
in some areas of the house , which is torn down under circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
these were in the property , which were tra@@ ded in the past drugs .
neighbours said they had to fight her on the road and had to be called on a regular basis .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ og@@ ated her and their partner this week for@@ ci@@ bly for@@ ci@@ bly from the property , after they gave them an extended period of 11 weeks to pull voluntarily .
the Del@@ og@@ ation were che@@ ered by facilit@@ ated neighbours , saying that her life was made to hell .
one said : &quot; they were ashamed . &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; today we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet - that &apos;s not usual !
now , wherever they are finally away , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that the family had to co@@ operate with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was established at regular intervals , 20 years long .
W@@ aste and old toys were thrown on the over@@ taking side of the con@@ jun@@ k .
he added : &quot; it is a dis@@ grace that it was administered by the ten@@ ant , any responsibility for their behaviour and their families since a delay is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing is considered .
that was a very difficult case since the behaviour was extremely difficult and their deeds for their neigh@@ bors had to be seen terrible .
I guess all the work , my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the church , which have cour@@ age@@ ous to us and have made us the information provided .
I hope that this development will don@@ ate a few neigh@@ bors &apos;s consol@@ ation and the message convey@@ s that ant@@ ile behavior is not toler@@ ated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they are all over 20 .
a dirty mattress in one of the bedroom of the house after del@@ og@@ ation dropped on the floor
workers of household management have to take gar@@ bage ga@@ ze that sur@@ round the house
in 2014 , the police led a raid on the house and found more than 70@@ g of cannabis as well as orph@@ agen , par@@ ap@@ her@@ es and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
the sk@@ el@@ eton received a fine of money after they pleaded not guilty to the possession of a drug B in trade views .
it claimed that the money for a gra@@ vest@@ one of her son Lee sk@@ don was born in 2013 in a car accident .
after they were without Ob@@ d@@ ach , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partners are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth .
many rooms walls of the house were described with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that they will not keep ten@@ og@@ og@@ ation that hold not to the house of the house
Angela C@@ row was distributed by the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall that Del@@ og@@ ation is a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants that do not hold on the house regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is going to those that they may remember without a self @-@ screening , as well as to those who were sent from such a behaviour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ iso@@ behaviour that continue to work with partners to protect our municipalities .

the Air Force pointed out that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that no security risks were fore@@ seen
this was the moment when tourists begin to start in pan@@ ic , after a eff@@ ig@@ ree jet turned over a full beach .
dramatic video recordings showed just like the military plane close to the sun centre on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ u@@ chs , when they began to under@@ stand@@ able , wor@@ ried about the noise of the dim power station , without seeing what was added through the clouds to her .
the incident occurred last night in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many tourists who post@@ ulated videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; it flew twice a very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it . &quot;
N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; I was just in surfing , and it felt so that the plane would fall down to me . &quot;
tourists on the beach of Av@@ eiro stayed in pan@@ ic when the airplane came from the darkness and incredibly deeply flew
the Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3C Ori@@ on plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats from the coast and so deep to see that this was the only possibility to recognize them .
the speaker said that the jet was slightly lower than usual in the proximity of bad visibility due to the bad view of the area , however , the Air Force took care that there was no time to end@@ anger@@ ed security at any time .
area fires have destroyed these summer parts of the Portuguese mainland , where four people came to death on the island of Madeira .
the Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly to a strong neb@@ ula and Bran@@ dr@@ on - as low as its visibility
the plane was located on a training flight where the pilot had to identify a part of the exercise .

before the first mandatory game of the new game , there is no doubt about the fitness level of the team , who was sub@@ du@@ ed on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool at 0 : 4 .
also at the 3 : 2 in the trial of S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ on@@ el Mess@@ i and Co . not really convincing .

Donald Tr@@ ump spatial &quot; tremendous problems &quot; in the election campaign
the leadership of the US rep@@ ublic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive wor@@ ries , even in a traditionally con@@ serv@@ atives states .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now stated the weak@@ nesses of his elec@@ toral campaign in the Republi@@ can Hoch@@ burg Utah .
a rare moment , in which the multi @-@ track and self @-@ exposed Mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire reported something like concerns , as correspondence reported .
after having cast 16 ri@@ vals within the race of the race , the Zweifel now grow to his success in the fight for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a massive problems in Utah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Tr@@ ump from evangel@@ ical Christians , which he asked for support in important federal states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
iniquity may be false reports about his candidate , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media reports .
Republi@@ can Hoch@@ bur@@ gen W@@ ack@@ ing
Utah is normally a safe bank for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a survey conducted by survey@@ or , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump and his competitors from Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other institutes see Tr@@ ump in front , but not with the distance that are usual for Republi@@ can candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are considered to be end@@ anger@@ ed .
in an interview of the Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump answered the question as he did to stop the advance of Clin@@ t : &quot; as I have done so far . &quot;
and if you are back : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he do not make anything else &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is impossible for him in the end of reasons for the political correc@@ t@@ ness , it is ok , said Tr@@ ump continued .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the Party Tr@@ ump should be threat@@ ening to handle money for the support of his elec@@ toral campaign , he should not be able to present a better conversion values .
instead of finding the candidates of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans for Congress stronger than arms .
Olympia : rotating fr@@ aud in d@@ oping @-@ Test
the IOC wants to raise a discipline to the event .
Ken@@ yan athl@@ ete could be threatened with the second d@@ oping aff@@ air at the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games .
after an attempt in an d@@ oping control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a coach at home .
the International Olympic Committee distributed to the International Olympic Committee immediately to investigate the case .
a ken@@ ian@@ ical function was told that the former Sprinter and current coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , a Ur@@ in sample under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ L@@ ate F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich .
this was the team@@ work of Ken@@ yan reported by d@@ oping control reports .
the IA@@ AF world association has searched the IOC for information about the case to implement his own investigations into an IA@@ AF speaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IOC , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; called it in an IA@@ AF explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has passed and signed as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on red and signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ken@@ yan Chef de Mission Stephan ar@@ ap So@@ i &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was owned by the ac@@ creditation of athletes born on the list for training control of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich has become more than 800 meters in Beijing World Championship in 2015 .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan athlet@@ ics leader Michael Rot@@ ich was deduc@@ ted from the Rio Olympics .
he is supposed to have informed against cash payments from his country over the d@@ oping control tests .
according to media reports he allegedly transferred to Nairobi at his return at the airport of Nairobi .
Kenya has been under special observation during the IOC after numerous D@@ oping control .
with the announcement of the more than 2000 d@@ oping control checks in front of the Rio games were never noted that particularly athletes from Kenya and Russia are taken into vis@@ or .
the world anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency took a lot of pressure on the African country in Brazil , causing an anti @-@ d@@ oping control and a functioning control system .
the law was approved a few weeks before the Olympia @-@ Start .
in consequence , WA@@ DA Kenya participated in the list of countries whose d@@ oping control shape with the rules of WA@@ DA are .
Kenya is considered a big runner @-@ nation .
the country &apos;s athletes won by most medals in the World Cup in 2015 in Beijing .
in a number of TV reports the ARD has always been raised again that in Kenya D@@ oping @-@ agent , there will be a considerable ment@@ ality of the sports bet@@ ru@@ gs .
IOC member Richard Po@@ und asked for a similar research in Kenya , as he had put them in the Russian Track .
it could be proven that in this kind of sport @-@ area and system@@ ically grown @-@ d@@ op@@ t .

in Shakespeare @-@ Year , the Salzburg Festival show@@ cases the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic lovers , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .

the artistic director Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical in the temple of the classic and filled with the role of Mary a youth space .
in the orchestra the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ elan conductor Gust@@ av@@ o D@@ ud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin @-@ American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and mel@@ ody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bern@@ st@@ one music really in our blood !
in this production , Bart@@ oli plays a col@@ der Maria .
she is remin@@ is@@ cent of her lovers to her lovers with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dance .
the role of Mary has always fascin@@ ated me .
first , because she is musi@@ cally extraordinary !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says it in her song : &quot; I &quot; Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
it is therefore cle@@ ver , of course also n@@ ai@@ v , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is very similar to my Italian character , whom I have as Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laugh@@ ing Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ ud@@ amel is a wonderful artist for the opera singer : &quot; Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is so a honor for us to work with her .
she is an unknown man .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ments : &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a need for him .
you can see it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it is so a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a happy approach to life , that &apos;s all very important !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece is about advantages and fan@@ ati@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have gone refugees , then the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ans went to New York , and the New York inhabitants did not want them .
there are the same topics , and they are as well as today as it was .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .

but instead of famous naked people , they would like to find the next generation of Top@@ models for 2017 .
the editor of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us early this year that his neck magazine from classic school play@@ boys are distinctive , because &quot; Play@@ boy for men is . &quot;

Turkey : Kur@@ dish municipality counts with mass cur@@ ses
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he who doesn &apos;t fit and Erd@@ og@@ an , sits on pack@@ ets of caffeine , &quot; says the Presidency of the Gü@@ len &quot; Dialogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kur@@ dish community of Germany calcul@@ ates short term with tens of thousands of protection looking from Turkey to Germany .
in the medium term it might even be &quot; a few hundred thousand , &quot; the Group &apos;s band@@ end Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes .
because of the hard incident of the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an , the Kur@@ dish congregation in Germany expects a mass cur@@ ses to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands of thousands , medium @-@ term , with a few hundred thousand gu@@ ards from Turkey in Germany , when the Erd@@ og@@ an regime fought against min@@ orities and the democratic opposition &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Group CEO Ali Top@@ ra@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the government had over@@ moved the government before the months ago , 500,000 Kur@@ ds came to escape within Turkey .
after the sli@@ p@@ utsch fl@@ ames still se@@ cular and op@@ positi@@ onal ethnic Turks added .
many are re@@ w@@ ished in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state who res@@ umes its refugees , in his own country refugees &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the insurance company accused the targeted settlement of Syrian Arab@@ s in Kur@@ dish , but also in Algeri@@ an cities .
with this , Erd@@ og@@ an would increase the travel pressure to the remaining cur@@ ri@@ ans .
&quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks were already extinct in the past hundred years , &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k , who also became the CDU member .
the German government asked that the Federal Government has positioned itself as sharp as Austria against Erd@@ og@@ an and its pendant . &quot;

I feel no longer in Germany for the first time in the last months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks are looking for asylum in Germany , mainly Kur@@ ds and opposition .

as the newspaper committed under calling on numbers of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Turks occupied the biggest group of asylum in Germany before the coup .

Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; where to go , where it we@@ ds &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the nati@@ ves get nothing of the summer @-@ election campaign with - and the vacation from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to elect the coun@@ table .
they understood in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern .
in 2021 , the Parliament election will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays , the UK Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
as far as far as far , it doesn &apos;t work : summer holidays , heat and land st@@ ony ground - the b@@ lowing .
the loc@@ als that are convinced of the election campaign are to be on holiday .
the very most holiday , which are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are no loc@@ als , so may not choose the coun@@ table .
there are practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ per , the posters hang up , flyer , flyer and out at the end of the vote , only lab@@ ev@@ ing .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and final day of the International Day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern have to leave once again the election campaign just under the people .
the hot phase when you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it also goes to something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition , must be feared .
the SPD , since 1998 , has been the strongest party since 1998 , is now clear behind the CDU .
exciting , as strongly Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D , cuts and remains the end of co@@ al@@ ry @-@ aug@@ mented .
cel@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 , head of government , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive election campaign , one can see from his grand@@ parents .
he travels across the country , spread ros@@ es and pl@@ au@@ ds a little with the people as it was also his legendary vor@@ ous predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff &apos;s predecessor .
otherwise , sail@@ ors get cold feet and are Chancellor Merkel bl@@ ossom at the bl@@ ossom of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We will create &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have accelerated the way to the right hand word &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is now likely to cost him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CDU with its peak counter data , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier has already experienced , as it is when you set the right place to fight for the wrong place of election campaign .
she has invited twice a German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Merkel &apos;s German Bundestag ( German Bundestag ) in the northeast .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; it was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; accused Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary @-@ General of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern recently in N@@ DR .
but it &apos;s too bad to listen to the other corner of Germany , Angela Merkel once again .
apart from otherwise , the Nord@@ ost CDU remains largely on the usual elections on market sites and shopping m@@ alls with umbre@@ llas and air bal@@ lo@@ ons .
this , so , co@@ ca@@ des , plays only a &quot; lower role . &quot;
the Union also indicated that you have to leave the base in the country that they must ins@@ ist very strict , to find a wire to the people again .
it is like the left , the SPD , the Green Party , hardly available in the wake of the country .
however , the Council of the CDU elec@@ tor co@@ ca@@ des on his mit@@ re is also self @-@ lar@@ v@@ ous : &quot; you have to go there where people are we@@ ary , Golden weddings , each birthday party must be used . &quot;
because much on the game stands , Sell@@ ering has now called its SPD to an especially committed election campaign .
in surveys , the S &amp; Ds must last with 22 percent behind partners CDU ( 25 ) and just under the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the election of 2011 the SPD gained still at 3@@ 5.6 percent before the CDU ( 22 ) .
the gre@@ enery , small party with seven per cent in surveys , can only create the jump into the Parliament &apos;s Day .
they make out of the holiday @-@ need a modern virtu@@ e and put their choice of great @-@ share in the Internet .
&quot; online election campaign , &quot; it is called Claudia Müller .
otherwise , green election fought on track search for local c@@ erv@@ ants under the holiday .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the Spitz@@ enk@@ an@@ di@@ dat@@ in , cur@@ vy straight with a house@@ boat by the m@@ eckl@@ en@@ bur@@ gische lakes , and it is also beautiful .
your impression : &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is no penalty . &quot;
B@@ 27 refurb@@ ishment : restaurants suffer from pl@@ ung
in the speed , with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ it@@ ated , there is nothing to treat .
for the responsible persons of the construction work , which kicks off at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and only at 20 o &apos;clock , there is always praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have done everything rather well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vira T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the Jet @-@ gas station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no default .
the construction site was scheduled to be moved to the south at the beginning of October , until the end of October everything will be ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blessed will also be responsible for the construction works , for example , if it goes to the establishment of accommodation drives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the construction site on Monday to the south , and also the pl@@ ung of Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and therefore the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg , the traffic situation has been relaxed within the place .
the citizens can now turn back on both sides by O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen .
the place traffic through the place seems to be back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were some significant complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the organis@@ ational management of the restoration responsible for the refurb@@ ishment of Deputy Director Florian King . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many slaugh@@ tering sought and rather their Nav@@ i confi@@ dential than the sign@@ posts .
what led to that lack of trucks in the areas of living areas .
the speed limit does not have been observed , because the assembly has strengthened the measuring vehicle from M@@ ess .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were significant exceeding , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King that made himself a place on the spot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were already two to three per minute .
the speed@@ way was on the road at 77 km / h in the pace of the pace .
since the construction site has been moved , it has become a ser@@ ene .
for business@@ men at B 27 there is only a small consol@@ ation that is now open for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg to the road again .
business men don &apos;t want to look at the cards .
but that the B 27 @-@ renovation is led to them in revenues , each of whom you asks to look through .
but some more and some less affected are affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; who has to do less than do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end@@ ure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so for other companies , the renovation has hardly ever seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thomas Sul@@ z also speaks of a &quot; maximum light reduction in the car manufacturer Mai@@ er from a &quot; maximum slight decline , &quot; but also a certain course of course . &quot;
the cre@@ dit@@ ches are situated along the street .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , propriet@@ or of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds significant words .
this is threat@@ ening .
not only him but all of the restaurants have made it hard . &quot;
we lack@@ ed the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we have to be happy over every euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the revenues came to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far over 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the street production began his operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has released half of his staff .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half of it would have been dismissed , the policy would have to react differently .
instead , government President Jörg Schmidt on a request from G@@ öh@@ ner , if it could give a financial compensation , otherwise by the advantages of the location on the B 27 . now , they must even make the dis@@ advantages that result in the restoration of the restoration .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other coun@@ ties , where some gener@@ ously handled .
in all pru@@ dence , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue .
finally , the family business has been located here since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history .
that other members are now subject to less frequently due to the complicated transport of traffic , it can understand .
if you do not drive , it is also very nice .
that his ancest@@ or returned to the end of the re@@ financing work again , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt .
despite the cris@@ es with BSE and avian flu , G@@ öh@@ ner maintains the effects of the B 27 construction work on its client@@ ele for the biggest crisis which has experienced its restaurant in its long@@ standing history .
six months of construction work , which is already brutal .
in order to operate in the name of the terrorist control in laws .
following the recent proposals , Interior de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now a thick safety package .
but what has a Dul@@ ce status with terror to do ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Vers@@ öh@@ ner .
all his suggestions may be polit@@ ically acceptable , &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Federal Minister for the presentation of his new security deposit .
they call them up .
other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I also participated in this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as the Interior Minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the Interior of the Interior , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ cover@@ able con@@ sens@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the most recent proposals in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is a little time before he will present its conclusions for the security in the republic .
but they now fall as many more extensive .
a lot is known , announced that a new security authority must be encrypted with the buttons , is not new .
it is also not the fact that Germany must implement several EU specifications on flight data and weapons .
the call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities is not surprising .
to be part of Mai@@ zi@@ ère , a second call for proposals to date with the SPD : he wants to cr@@ ust sympath@@ y for terror groups under punishment and jihadists with double citizenship in the German Pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CDU men of the CDU man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still hold this for zum@@ ut@@ able and challenging , even what does not have any opportunities for the coalition partner .
a few new ideas presented by Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
they are partly in itself : he plans to express quick procedures for deportation and more possibilities for the in@@ dem@@ nity of people before the deportation .
refugees who will be picked up targeted to the country before their smart phones and social media accounts for a security check .
in the Dul@@ ce for past asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to destroy some worse than so far - such as those who walk offen@@ ders or their papers to swal@@ low their identity .
some of them is polit@@ ically and legally hei@@ kel .
man@@ ches also seems un@@ balanced and can be asked questions open .
and at a few points - at the im@@ aging of commem@@ oration , for example , the question arises : what does it actually have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the topics refugees and terror .
but it cannot be found in paragra@@ phs that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg refugees .
in addition , many people had wor@@ ried about the high level of refugee concerns about safety .
and things that keep the people deep@@ est , then in the election cycle times are not cl@@ amps .
the inner safety is enormous into the focus .
only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the insurance is large .
and yes , there are election campaign .
the Union and SPD become increasingly on the topic of inner safety increasingly in position .
in the past few days , it went up between the two parties .
only a gar@@ ris@@ er dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then via a security policy collection of some Unions of the Interior , in which the department leaders also require a Bur@@ ka @-@ ban and a return of double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also strug@@ gling here to reconc@@ ile tones here .
from a return from the double pass , he stop nothing .
we satis@@ fying the discussion in Germany .
you re@@ do it , don &apos;t make sense .
and with a Bur@@ ka @-@ ban , he interpreted the constitutional obj@@ ections .
whether his own package is un@@ constitutional on all corners , and whether it is actually &quot; zum@@ ut@@ able &quot; for the coalition partner , it has to show itself only .
there is a lot in what could make war .
but the SPD also tries to pro@@ filed under the topic of internal safety .
&quot; &quot; &quot; partner Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alizes only time for talk time and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even Volkswagen is still going through .
despite diesel fuel , the supplier will increase worldwide .
but in all markets it runs around .
in case of re@@ vocation there is a term to see a term .
Volkswagen starts with deliveries in the second half @-@ year period .
Europe &apos;s largest bus terminal can continue in the previous year despite the diesel aff@@ air thanks to its many brands and some good running markets further .
but in July the core record VW weak@@ ened primarily in Western Europe and again stressed the overall sales as the D@@ ax @-@ recorded company .
worldwide , the VW brand in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars sold 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the prior @-@ year figure .
in the home market of Germany , deliveries increased by almost a hex@@ ag@@ ths .
brand @-@ CEO Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July , primarily on two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Moreover , in some core markets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some core markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote led to the withdrawal from the EU , explained a spokes@@ woman .
in the USA where the exhaust gas aff@@ air first es@@ cal@@ ated , is also a min@@ us to be@@ ech .
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
overall , the mainly affected domestic brand of Lower Saxony will continue through the diesel version : after the first seven months , only an extra@@ dition of 0.9 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles is expected to be be@@ ech .
Group CEO Fred Kap@@ pler could continue to exhibit a sales figures from January to July .
1.3 percent more vehicles supplied Volkswagen at this time , 5,@@ 904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software departure .
in Germany alone , VW calls for about 2.5 million cars to conversion into the workshops .
in the course of retro@@ fitting the VW , that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after re@@ arm@@ ament of vehicles it is currently no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bus terminal is subject to customers after upgrading an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate , but talk not of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday in corporate communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason of legal experts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports , Volkswagen granted its German customers now a guarantee for the diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed on the previous Monday VW @-@ Represent@@ atives in the federal ministry .
the transport department was confirmed that there were this meeting .
&quot; VW has to fulfil the levels of my investig@@ ating Commission and the KBA customer . &quot;
&quot; deviations of these are not accepted , &quot; explained federal state minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to ministry .
VW has taken the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine output after re@@ arm@@ ament , and all typ@@ ing relevant vehicle values remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it &apos;s name in corporate communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term &quot; guarantee , Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers will come to a workshop half a year after conversion about a motor damage in a workshop - and that could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do .
also in customer interest , it is important to avoid that it is possible to do with any other damage caused by reason to do not with the Ab@@ g@@ ass@@ k@@ and@@ al , in order to be in@@ trin@@ si@@ cally safe with regards possible warranty rights as it was called .
therefore , the VW uses the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund in T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands major savings in the future - as the second Institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bank@@ heads Josef Paul said on Thursday &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is only about 139 customers that park 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Federal Association of German banks speaks of a single incident and does not see any signal : normal spar@@ er would have to be afraid to pay for their savings banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═
this charge requires the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits over 100.000 Euro to gi@@ ro@@ - or daily monetary policy .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100.000 will cost € 400 in the year &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has been working 40 million euros for ger@@ many times , which could be withdrawn from one day to the other , and could not fail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are with me in the central bank account and cause a 0.4 per cent cost , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ban@@ ker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot place 4000 Euros for every one million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost you will continue after the urs@@ ing principle .
the cash is easy to leave in the saf@@ es of Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank , too much to be dangerous : &quot; I haven &apos;t seen four fail@@ ures , I don &apos;t want to hear the fifth ! , &quot; said the Bank &apos;s Chief Financial Officer .
most customers have their understanding and changes to other investment forms .
only few walking to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association Bayern explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB caused considerable costs for all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they alone contribute to bear , be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; efficient &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for con@@ gest@@ ation , credit cards or transfers .
with pen@@ sions for deposits of three million euros , the Thuring@@ ian People and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burger country made head@@ lines in 2014 .
Michael Kem@@ mer , chief executive guide of the banking association , said : &quot; we do not expect that private clients need to pay for deposits , this is the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks a lot too strong . &quot;
a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , &quot; a client@@ ele , which is a little l@@ ush under the fortune . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a small bank for the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is free of charge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , G@@ mund founded two offices in Bad Wies@@ see , R@@ ott@@ ach @-@ E@@ glad@@ bach , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
in the region well known actors , athletes and entrepren@@ eurs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; currently no other banks are known , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ person for deposits of private clients , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of June , the President of the Federal Association of German People and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ banks ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared : &quot; the threshold , to neg@@ atives to neg@@ atives , is very high . &quot;
the competition is hard , and the emig@@ ration of the emig@@ ration to the competition .
customers in Germany will not leave this in the width .
Dest@@ ination plates : who does not buy sound plates ?
lon@@ ely men middle age love plates .
before you have to over@@ sow@@ ed him under the pseud@@ onym @-@ Al@@ le@@ ak@@ sam@@ ic male age @-@ age @-@ age , this statement is derived from the current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the most important re@@ discovery of sound plates do not want to welcome to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als who want to welcome the physical objects from physical objects but to Mid@@ life nost@@ al@@ gia .
those who have recently purchased a plate are all fo@@ resi@@ ght according to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely K@@ äu@@ ble group .
it is also no hor@@ des through hob@@ by@@ ists - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers retain their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoying the time to spend time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog would follow a news report on TV , I would follow me the camera , while I keep in the midst of a busy street in S@@ oho , a modest grey suit and wild beast before I steal , my hands hold and something best determin@@ ations like : &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
even if the heart of So@@ H@@ os is slowly on its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the building where an independent seller has been located - there are still a hand@@ ful of fantastic record shops .
I would probably ask the camera to switch the camera for the next part , in which I am standing in close proximity to different men in such stores and try to estimate their age and stud through observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I am of S@@ ister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men middle age ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men middle age , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collectors , ask me ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; says he .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
this sound boards , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I am not followed him ) , dressing the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of its available income : it is now able to buy plates which he could not aff@@ ord and buy objects , which he sold , when he was young and ple@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy , are out of the late 60s , early 70s , which was appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things where I was probably something too young , to buy it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true that those who buy plates are rather stra@@ ined and glad@@ ly spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I do not wear and I am not very much .
this is my L@@ aster .
We@@ z , 25 , who works at S@@ ister Ray , believes that many customers who hits the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , it also noted a new wave of people that are influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and have to see their old records again .
of the convers@@ ations which I have led , people usually ended up in 1998 or 1999 of their collection .
customers that once sold their records to buy CDs , now sell their CDs to buy their records . &quot;
this would explain the boom on tra@@ ilers of a certain age in a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds into a business like phon@@ ica to realize that record business offers a soo@@ thing community of equ@@ alled content .
according to We@@ z some of the older customers took a cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel themselves overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to withdraw the stability of trusted sound covers , of objects that are happ@@ ier .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or possession of material owners than a kind of comfort , &quot; says We@@ z .
that &apos;s with me as a collector so and I think it is so with many people so .
it is a simple way to employ intellectual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social worker ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a staff of a record stack from a record stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of IC@@ M in April 2009 had almost 50 % of the people who have purchased a plate over the last month , have not yet heard .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record players they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a plate , do not have a record players .
at that time of the news report I would probably look very concerned , while I have a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova Com@@ pil@@ ations .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at the sounds of the Universe ( number of data : three men aged men ) has noticed an &quot; t@@ rophy &quot; of the Revi@@ val . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone arrived only here and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no record players , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead Schall@@ platte , so that I can ask them to the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a large percentage , but it definitely passes .
more productive load , less musi@@ c@@ auti@@ ous .
we have people who say : &quot; I have no record players . &quot;
that are younger people , not older , which come only slowly .
F@@ opp , dedicated to the sound plates almost a whole floor , has an b@@ lower audience , as I go .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ ager and women middle age .
even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the af@@ ore@@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts of latest Syn@@ thesis and experts @-@ looking pop instead of experimental jazz . it is good to see such a dip in the customer .
none of them sees strange lon@@ ely , but n@@ ag@@ ating mental trau@@ mat@@ a are hard to be fixed , if you stand for 30 seconds in addition .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around a few minutes in the business and viewed the variation of the sheets for sale .
it &apos;s rather a sh@@ ov@@ ary h@@ ack@@ mel than a big buy @-@ out .
they do not earns much , therefore the collection of plates do not have real option , says it .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to listen to one computer or other way , but the beauty of plates is ... it drives with a sweet sig@@ h .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it is really unique .
my last stop is a store that is said that a new generation of record lovers will insp@@ ire : Urban Out@@ jam &quot;
while I give the ticket that je@@ ans @-@ Hot@@ p@@ ants , I observe a group of young teen@@ ager , who group@@ ed for a moment by Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras , before a father and his daughter is superior to buy a Cros@@ ley record Player .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of records of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classi@@ cs , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody looks on it - perhaps because they are only pure decor@@ atively , some so far above that it is impossible to handle them .
it is pure &quot; panel art . &quot;
but considering that each attraction for these objects represent more money for the industry and some customers could mean in the depths of So@@ H@@ os for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain about .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money as others , even the one that is most for luxury objects like plates .
even if my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ als , it is , at least in record shops in S@@ oho , the great number of female collectors and record lovers that exist in reality , record shops and online .
these people probably work hard in school or offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with safety not with the st@@ roll through record business of the Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves , while holding the star@@ red view of an un@@ secret , 30 @-@ year @-@ old Moder@@ ator of mei@@ osis , that affects the shoul@@ ders of middle age .

French Court ref@@ uses over demol@@ ition of shops in the jung@@ le refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jung@@ le of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live .
with a trial negoti@@ ating this week , the authorities argu@@ ed in Cal@@ ais that the state should be authorised to sell 72 pro@@ vis@@ or@@ ical shops , in which persons sell by cigarettes to Energ@@ y@@ wall , sell , hair@@ dresser , or tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture argu@@ ed that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy , which would not be paid out of non @-@ tax profit and san@@ ction risk .
humanitarian groups divided the court that businesses and restaurants are important since the free meals that are offered by the nation@@ ally supported association and other groups are not enough food for growing numbers in the warehouse .
they led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 pro@@ vis@@ ory businesses , but dre@@ amed that the concerns of the Pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; was absolutely retro@@ fitting . &quot;
the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that the grocery stores , cafes and restaurants will play a lot of larger role than merely to feed people who live in extremely pre@@ valent conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas of quiet meeting between refugees and volunteers offer .
one of the places that was threatened by the re@@ mor@@ sel was the jung@@ le book kids &apos; café of the camp , which is a non @-@ profit and 200 meals a day , English and French classes and an advice about asylum procedures for the hundreds of personal needy , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the petition to maintain the kids &apos; café .
in a letter to the Guardian , it was that the closure of &quot; for these children were a cat@@ astrophe , of which the youngest eight years old are . &quot;
the two auxiliary organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge of Mig@@ rants has risen to over 9,000 people in the jung@@ le @-@ bearing living - the highest number until now - according to a steep increase of new jobs in the summer .

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
Germany R@@ aser have to set up the next generation speed measurements : in different federal states , amongst others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested especially effective .
the fut@@ ur@@ istic En@@ forcement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at accidents where it would be dangerous for mobile measurement through the police .
for example , on highway building sites or to rehabil@@ it@@ ating bridges , with temporary speed pol@@ ishing , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure there with a stationary bl@@ ender for compliance with the speed limit .
a more durable mobile structure can be too dangerous or co@@ ag@@ ile .
the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ ark : its battery lasts five days with un@@ interrup@@ tions five days , the case data will be encrypted using a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be captured via multiple traces simultaneously .
variable speed lim@@ bs as well as flow rate acc. to time , sched@@ ules and vehicle class can also be seen .
in the high @-@ driven condition , one can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with each car with trailer hit@@ ch .
in this way , he is not simply cut off , it is lowered into a measuring mode , so that the wheels in the pan@@ eled and by the way also disappear .
furthermore , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the bl@@ ender before V@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and now also used .
foreign authorities also co@@ ols with the new technology : recently , France has 100 items followed , after an order of 150 copies last year .
great Britain won silver in the 7 @-@ seater Rug@@ by , after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold
the impressive power of Britain at the 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by arrived in the final on Thursday evening to a ab@@ rupt stop at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were defeated with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ od@@ oro Stadium in Rio .
Fi@@ ji split a master class in the handling , Side Step@@ ping , Return , line , and ro@@ aring power to win gold - their first Olympi@@ am@@ ed@@ aille each color .
the defeat was sunk by the silver medal of the silver medal - Great Britain on that day - and they could definitely be quite proud in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals at the same day could fall back in the final .
but many of them would have been defeated a 15 @-@ man team in the form of this form .
it could be a consol@@ ation for GB , but it is probably not - that at least one Br@@ ite will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben Ry@@ an , the former boss for England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult track behind itself .
eight years ago she lost under Ry@@ an every game with Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
they just lost one .
this can@@ opy is we@@ ary but the progress is aston@@ ishing .
Fi@@ ji began wonderful and caused the attacks of GB@@ S from Sp@@ ass .
it felt the captain Tom Mitchell and Co . , when one would run in driving buses . the World Series winner went up 5 @-@ 0 to top , than O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au at the corner .
with even four minutes of playing Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i , Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i still added a further attack from the right corner , which he walked .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly got the ball .
a h@@ ack@@ le T@@ ack@@ le of Mitchell stops the mountain of man Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third goal , but Fi@@ ji only stopped .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a in the right corner a touch down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re @-@ p@@ fi@@ ff and there was still over a minute game time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ v@@ ou pre@@ f@@ ished by a weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion completed a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it &apos;s so , as Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB are still going to be in .
this is how it is too .
the UK introduced basic changes to half @-@ time and completed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova ran into a Br@@ illi@@ ant intermediate play by Fi@@ ji .
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game ran long in favor of the south se@@ ab@@ ians , whose fans sang , flags pi@@ voted and dancing at the Tri@@ bun@@ e .
it was not difficult to admire the play at Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the i @-@ bag with another attempt in the last seconds .
the p@@ fi@@ ff cor@@ onation , the Fi@@ j@@ is im@@ pover@@ ished and GB , hit the grass in the grass .
formerly on the day Fi@@ ji Japan had defeated a semi @-@ final with 20 @-@ 5 defeated and the United Kingdom destroyed South Africa in a cris@@ p @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the UK - Great Britain of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half after the front , but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive foot work and scored a gate under the post in the second half .
a brilliant late Tac@@ kling from Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side teams , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning through fight with the cancer of the trainer for rowing victory
there will be no emotional gold than with these games , and that wants to be hot .
from the first stro@@ be up to the last , 220 hard h@@ ieve in history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in her golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though there were only the Bei@@ ge , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the Train@@ ers Robin Williams , was present at the second Olympi@@ an in a row , the first women in the history of British Sports , which laid down such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all her 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ wanted application , which is also exempl@@ ary .
what we see are two brilliant Athlet@@ es , which reflects the surface with the elegance of go@@ ers , refle@@ cting not the kind of triumph@@ s to ge@@ ese .
behind each gold in ru@@ des , a batt@@ ali@@ on to consent to the incre@@ mental progress , which make the difference , and there was nobody known as the trainer , who didn &apos;t know this day when he was diagnosed with cancer at all .
as he said he was ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , the oper@@ able is and they did it .
if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a rather bad situation .
it changes a little view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could start at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , could start what the inter@@ ruption was at a minimum , if this is the right term in such circumstances .
I needed money , therefore I had to go better again soon .
it was an incenti@@ ve .
I was in the hospital and ran on the station about 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
this is how it starts .
the rowing is already a challenge , but this makes it even larger .
in the in@@ firm@@ ity of the Victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerv@@ ous morning to talk something more than else , and thus tried to process his own fears .
St@@ anning who was as cent@@ ur@@ ion at the Royal Art@@ illery Reg@@ iment in a deployment in Afghanistan , &quot; I was a emotional wreck this week . that &apos;s perhaps something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
it is repeated , how much me that means , how much I and Helen and also have been working too .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin , we had no one , therefore , is a massive thanks to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I would have no better person to trainer or wish to wish a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have no race lost in the last five years .
the pair had a hard rhythm with whom their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had a lot in reserve .
we were caught very at the moment .
Helen called &quot; lead in the process , lead in the process . &quot;
it is really important to rip off .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not going to make something fine .
we wanted no fire@@ works today , we wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race what we did .
the pair will take a break for a year before making decisions on his future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now they just want to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
this would have too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to realize that I am a Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
that feels like much better , &quot; she said .

so it was time for some time in the origin@@ alt@@ on in a Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk &apos;s contribution .
a little later , the water forum called the government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken &apos;s government .

there are water supply agreements for other towns and municipalities .
the current chairman , widescreen Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert was set up in 1985 as a water@@ way and was appointed general manager of the purpose of the purpose .
&quot; its duties are very varied and they extended by the water management structure and maintenance work on office and organis@@ ational activities , the budget plan , calculation of fees and contributions to emer@@ gen@@ cies on weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as an outstanding events , she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , the establishment of a new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of the farmers , the renovation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the new acquisition of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the sub@@ missions of water lines .
there have been no stand@@ still , and I always recorded innovations , because water is do@@ ute and drinking water the most important food .

the biggest challenge and difficult conditions were the ground @-@ quar@@ ry at the peak in the church of Kirch@@ schläger on a 3rd of January .
here , at minus 17 degrees they had to work through the whole night , so that the villages could be supplied with water .
even the supply of new brun@@ n can only be calculated once , because you filled the container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with slaugh@@ ter@@ ies .

steel - Light view for German steel industry
the cr@@ ushed and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed at extra cost of million@@ aires .
financial investments , which is from the industry from the eco @-@ electricity funding , are from the table .
it will remain with the liberation from the Renewable Energi@@ es for the existing chemical production in the German steel industry , the Federal Minister for Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) in the West German general newspaper &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m really happy that we could finally reach after two years of negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the European Commission , the European Commission initially planned to deplo@@ y steel manufacturer , gases from the high furnace for electricity production , to the cas@@ hier .
steel industry threatened according to the German industry association an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , it is now giving a basic agreement with the EU Commission after talks with competition controversi@@ al Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only if the generators be replaced in steel stations , an EEG conversion rate of 20 percent will be replaced .
but these will not be collected in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the EU Commission to O@@ wn .
this will largely be the status Quo of the previous regulation .
special significance have the successful design of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in regard to our campaign &apos; steel is the future &apos; is the first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; further must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of emission rights , climate and employment goals are considering &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the financial crisis of 2008 , the steel industry has been suffering under over@@ capacity and a substantial pricing pressure .
last year , the situation continued , as the world &apos;s largest producer in China , faced with the weaker domestic demand of demand steel onto the global market .
European producers t@@ oss chin@@ ese steel con@@ tra prize d@@ umping .
in the course of this spring the situation has a little relaxed .
for example , import duties on import st@@ ables , to others have increased economic prospects in China .
un@@ clear is how sustain@@ ably the price recovery is .
the German industry prim@@ us Th@@ yss@@ en@@ Krupp re@@ marked on Thursday .

Th@@ yss@@ en@@ Krupp wanted to un@@ lock the closing arguments of individual works .
at the end of 2015 , around 86@@ ,000 people were employed in the German steel industry .
in July , the German steel producer remain silent despite increasing prices and increasing orders .
they produced six percent less cru@@ de steel than in the previous month &apos;s month , including the Wirtschafts@@ vereinigung steel on Friday .
after a short rise in May , the quantity returned to the second month in a row .

community , Spirit , health : singing senior citizens well
the singing has been accompanied by her life : the young woman she was a young girl in school , teaching music , and today she s@@ ings the 78 @-@ year @-@ old in a senior ch@@ orus .
&quot; singing me - emotional and physical , &quot; describes them .
after a rehear@@ sal it feels balanced , che@@ er@@ ful and altogether living , she says .
at the moment they do something good with their health and spirit .
for singing out of several perspectives a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior league .
most senior citizens singing in ch@@ orus and sharing the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through the regular coll@@ age , seniors and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures are frequent in age , a ch@@ orus is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
this experience has also done Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her ch@@ orus : &quot; to arrange themselves and to organise themselves to the others - a ch@@ orus is a very special form of the compositions . &quot;
sing to sing in the positive sense , H@@ ac@@ kler is concerned .
because there is a deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly calls his lungs are not so fast in everyday life out of the pu@@ rest .
even if it comes to obtain the sound of the voice in the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby .
on older people , S@@ ingen is often a very special effect , Ursula L@@ enz says of the German labour community of the senior organizations .
in the older generations , the common rop@@ ingen had a much higher job , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure , explains them .
L@@ enz commonly observed that the singing or listening of songs in elderly people are many memories , often connected with positive feelings of their youth .
by song lyrics and especially melo@@ dies of self @-@ de@@ men@@ stru@@ cted people in long back events .
at S@@ ingen , the head becomes a special power , explains L@@ enz .
at the same time to concentrate on its own voice and on a pre @-@ given rhythm and to adapt the other things - this is a huge cogn@@ itive challenge .
just older people who live alone , do not have to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one drives through the singing in the ch@@ orus , the H@@ ac@@ kler is driving .
an enthusi@@ astic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ est@@ e@@ em grows through the singing in ch@@ orus .
to show itself : if I have long for something , I will better and watch over me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start with singing , so there &apos;s enough .
anyone who wants to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he believes , little talent .
one s@@ ings not alone - at 50 sing@@ ly people who list@@ ens to it if a sound goes beside it ?
in search of the suitable offer there are seniors different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if anyone s@@ ings from the acquain@@ t@@ ance in a veter@@ an age , you can simply connect .
many cities also offer views of the choirs in the surrounding area .
he who wants to sing in a church choir can turn right in the church or church leaders .
many senior members can also be found on the Internet .
anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask friends or neigh@@ bors to help help at the website .
everyone who desire to sing is to connect to a choir , ab@@ t H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing the soul good and has something strange - that is valid for every age .
cats react to cr@@ ater than cr@@ ater of the young
bi@@ ologists have examined in Hanover , the effect of the pen@@ alties of Kat@@ zen@@ bab@@ ys on adult animals .
for her surprise the ten@@ se didn &apos;t let the male did not get cold - but they kept always in contrast to the females always .
female cats can recognize the rain level of cat bab@@ ys on the edge of the little ones .
they respond to ten percent faster on Lau@@ te von K@@ itt@@ ens , who have found himself in great affliction , such as scientists from the medical physician and Medical University Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
c@@ ater also react to the ru@@ ff@@ ness of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always equal .
&quot; apparently , the acoustic differences between the r@@ ink of less and strongly sh@@ reg@@ ained for the males either not perc@@ ep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the Bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H .
it is first authorized in the study conducted at the BM@@ C Evol@@ u@@ ket Biology in this Friday .
in a previous study , the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ arius are distinguished with the rough@@ ness of her help .
a total of nine adult c@@ ater and eight refriger@@ ants were observed from the holding of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a ru@@ ff of little ones , which were taken out of the throw box for three minutes and separated from the mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
to the others , they were con@@ fron@@ ted with cry of stronger k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised in addition .
the researchers keep their results despite the minor sample for sa@@ ge@@ ther .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females even those who had not had their own offspring re@@ acted on the Schre@@ ie &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned qu@@ icker for the speakers , when this plane was playing very much k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may be born or do well with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the male re@@ acts at all , &quot; said the Bi@@ ologist .
in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men on a baby cot .
also some studies showed that women re@@ acted sensitive to infants , no matter whether they were mothers or not , the Bi@@ olog@@ o Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .

prior to Du@@ ell of the arch@@ ri@@ vals between Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ skis Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya is the official line clearly : &quot; business as usual &quot; is said .
even with the suspension of the acceptance test in July , the government , the everyday life of normal radi@@ ators should not be imp@@ aired .
this does not apply to those who are suspected to belong to the motion of the Pre@@ dig@@ nity Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
it is not made in front of the football .
the public prosec@@ utor issued an arrest warrant against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r .
accordingly , the South of the South of America has been accused of being member of the terrorist group in America .
Sü@@ k@@ r is to be followers of Pre@@ dig@@ er Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by the President Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an .
although the first country has been pending for 90 days , until October , actually , it has actually the life of most Turks , but as good as no effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the n@@ igh@@ tly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Democracy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on public places throughout the country has ended ground conditions on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split in pendant and opponent of Erd@@ og@@ ans .
particularly fans of the workers &quot; club Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as do not count towards the friends of the president .
but what happened the Gro@@ s of the Turks in view of dramatic experiences in history , the strict re@@ jection of military coup .
there &apos;s even the fans , whether their heart be@@ ats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as .
at Pok@@ al@@ sieg@@ er &quot; Gala , it is going to arrive at Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski .
its sporty value exhibited in the past season in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first playing time as Top@@ sc@@ orer of his association .
in the final match against F@@ ener@@ b@@ ah@@ ce , he scored the 1 : 0 victory .
the newspaper &quot; Fan@@ atik &quot; celebrated him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he completed the season in an excellent way and secured the t@@ rophy in his team .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record champion found a reconc@@ il@@ ful conclusion .
after the Vor@@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; will also come out early in the Europe League .
in the South by Li@@ g it was only enough to rank six .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only possibility to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was done , and it is the most important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ic@@ t@@ as ran the game year better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who generated with 26 seasonal numbers as a sweet@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ tor@@ ment@@ ary laid the basis for the 14th title .
that &apos;s also the reason that fans hope to return to the 31 @-@ year @-@ old year .
during the AC Florence , under the contract and on Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as only announced Gom@@ ez managed to return to the coup , due to the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ vacation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario will come to us , he must only say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; club manager F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to this , the stri@@ ker would have to be ready to abst@@ ain from around one @-@ third of its estimated 7.5 million euros of the estimated yearly beginning , Or@@ man presented it clear : &quot; his content in Florence is not able to pay . &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes still have medals opportunities at Olympia in Rio
the 34 year old Just@@ in Gat@@ lin was closed twice because of D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa may not start in Rio .
others exc@@ essive Athlet@@ ics @-@ sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio by med@@ alli@@ ons .
d@@ oping the subject of D@@ oping down to the Rio Olympics Games in Rio .
the Russian s@@ mer@@ in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , who had been compl@@ ained after a d@@ oping block to her start before playing , was put out on her start ( 100 meters chest of chest ) .
there was a sk@@ ur@@ red Sz@@ ener@@ ie : with an elabor@@ ate smile she was still proud in the hall and prov@@ oked her appearance with their appearance .
as a festive , that they won &apos;t take gold , the audience broke out in a j@@ ub@@ el@@ storm .
but there are many more sports@@ men who go to the Rio Olympics in spite of D@@ oping @-@ past .
here an overview :
Just@@ in Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the controversi@@ al figures in the lightweight athlet@@ ics .
he had already blocked two times for D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since his debut , the Olympic Champion of 2004 and Ex @-@ world champion runs faster than before , it is more than 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered to be the greatest challenge of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympi@@ asi@@ bility and seven @-@ month world champion had to sit in 2010 after you have demonstrated the intake of pain by Oxy@@ co@@ don .
after an operation , she had experienced strong t@@ ooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old def@@ ended .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 the Olympic champion of 2012 , world champion from 2013 and European Champion from 2010 to 2016 was positive on the prohibited stimul@@ ant medium meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine .
Per@@ kovic suffered high intake and was closed for six months .
the four far dig@@ nity of this year will go to the account of the great gold f@@ avo@@ ids .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympics Champion and the two @-@ time world champion over 400 m was positive tested and closed for 21 months in 2010 .
a means to the penis enlargement would have been responsible , praying Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 metres far so far the world &apos;s fastest man .
I@@ wan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( hammer throw , Belarus ) : probably hardly any athletes were subsequently recognized as many medals .
so Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Cup title nine years later , after it was diagnosed with testosterone D@@ oping .
in addition , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to leave the Olympic Silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid D@@ op@@ ings and EM @-@ title in 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
he also recognized Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ aille of the 2008 Olympic Games in 2008 due to a judgment of the International Sports Tribunal CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is ranked two of the World Ran@@ kings .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : world record of ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or and Gold@@ f@@ it@@ in was only tested in May , but may still start in Rio .
at the 29 years old world champion , indications on the intake of a prohibited dietary supplement had found , the Sper@@ re of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency WA@@ DA fell mil@@ de and ran out on July 13th .
bomb error in Thailand - Austri@@ ans wounded - Sever@@ al deaths
the Austrian embassy in Thailand stand with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ öll , Friday morning .
they suffered cutting wounds , and was treated in the hospital , but this has already been abandoned .
her home trip is planned for early September .
whether of other explo@@ sions on vacation island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ phe , Austrian citizens are also un@@ clear .
the Department of Foreign Affairs are related to the local authorities , with the local authorities , so far .
at approximately 200 kilometres south of Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in , first two bombs were explo@@ ded on Thursday evening .
according to the police , there were killed in Thailand and killed about 20 people , among them the Austri@@ ans , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
on Friday morning , Friday morning , two spr@@ ints went up , and was killed , according to the authorities , a further human being killed .
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket was reported in the morning of a bombing .
at Det@@ onation in the vicinity of the popular swi@@ m@@ ds of Pat@@ ong Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , killing a municipal employees .
according to the authorities , the explo@@ si@@ ves have gone into the air according to the authorities in a meadow before the Re@@ four of the coastal police .
finally , Det@@ on@@ ations called for Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g at the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ om@@ phe on the south @-@ east coast of several injured .
you go from a link with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called .
&quot; the bom@@ b@@ att@@ ate bear the same hand@@ writing , &quot; said army ener@@ al Dan@@ ai Crit@@ ic@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before journalists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect to coordin@@ ate a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to exter@@ n@@ ate oneself possible . however , it is likely to do the acts of Muslim reb@@ els .
the Thai media also wanted to recogn@@ ise a sample that is typical for the bom@@ b@@ att@@ ent Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
however , the Thai police stated , the attacks were not related to the Islam@@ ist movement , or with the international terrorism .
&quot; this is only local Sab@@ ot@@ age who is restricted to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said one speaker in Bangkok .
it is rather , that the bom@@ bers of the ruling military j@@ unta were laid .
in the past few days the authorities have received mysterious references to the upcoming attack in the south of the country - but they don &apos;t have been informed about the exact time and the places were informed .
it is still un@@ clear that group behind the attacks .
the police demonstrated its officials throughout the country to strengthen safety around important government buildings as well as airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ us@@ ement district .
in Thailand there are always smaller bomb attacks , but they usually do not stand against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years of Thailand King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
according to understanding , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , to follow the instructions of Thai security authorities .
high level of safety ( security level 3 ) sailed for the provinces Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ enn@@ ines and its surroundings .
after disp@@ utes between security forces and Muslim populations , not necessary trips to these provinces are not necessary .
increased security risks ( security level 2 ) sailed for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday confirmed a few days after a controversi@@ al referendum on a Constitution of the military j@@ unta .
these dre@@ amed influence of the military also in the coming years .
Jun@@ ta CEO and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ CH@@ A said that bombs were an attempt to sti@@ ve chaos , while the country rises to stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism .
the military j@@ unta , which took power in 2014 after a phase of bloody uph@@ e@@ aval resi@@ sts itself , maintains the kingdom and lead to stability and order .
however , it is not successful in the military , which has been in the extreme south of the country &apos;s former insur@@ rection of Muslim reb@@ els in the handle .
over 6500 people have been killed in the conflict .
some one year ago in Bangkok at a stop at a popular Hin@@ du @-@ Sch@@ cleansed 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody attack of the younger history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is based in the vis@@ or of the Federal Office of Constitutional protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several provincial agents , the Constitutional Court also provided the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we look at the &apos; Ident@@ ity Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; points for asp@@ ir@@ ations against the freedom of democratic &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Constitutional Court Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the German press agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , immig@@ rants are diff@@ usion in extrem@@ ist manner from the Middle East in extrem@@ ist manner .
therefore we observe the movement now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group of French roots which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of your own identity through over@@ sight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuring@@ ia - observe the &quot; Ident@@ ity . &quot;
Ma@@ ate said , his authority is closely matched to the decision by decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &apos; Ident@@ itarian Movement &quot; try to fet@@ ch their target group where she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the Constitutional Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generally , extrem@@ ists try extrem@@ ists to learn with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the tä@@ ten Islam@@ ists as well as legal gu@@ ists .
this is not an extra advertising for the own thing .
prop@@ aganda is to say the people emotional .
young people are due in particular ways .
this is dangerous .
in fact , in several German states there were reports about contacts of the &quot; Ident@@ ity &quot; to the Af@@ D policy .
Ma@@ ate did , I have no knowledge .
for the constitutional protection , the possible contacts of this type is not relevant only from a certain point .
it comes to whether the relevant party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain people who are extrem@@ ist , its target direction and so extrem@@ ist .
this is crucial , whether such persons have the effect on the party .
this is not recogni@@ z@@ able .
with a look at the significant increase of justi@@ fi@@ able offen@@ ders and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee camps , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak in this context of new terrorism .
but we &apos;ve found in the past years that it can give legal structures .
there were group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday Group .
it may be well that further justi@@ fi@@ al group@@ ings or small groups form the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee camps , or attacks of other legal gu@@ ards .
however , a German @-@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control system is not recogni@@ z@@ able but not recogni@@ z@@ able .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
in fact , Ma@@ ate insi@@ sted that many over@@ g@@ ings went up to the account of people who did not occur in the scene before .
this is the concern .
many of the facts of attacks on as@@ yl@@ under@@ took are not known as crimin@@ als , polit@@ ically motiv@@ ated offen@@ ders or pendant of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have already committed offen@@ ders previously with legal gu@@ ists who were perhaps polit@@ ically in@@ different or for example CDU , SPD or lin@@ ke , who then radic@@ ally have radic@@ alised with justi@@ fication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is used to inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine the Olympic Games or world records at the Olympic Games .
this shows the bra@@ ve appearance of RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slowly that he was not able to see more in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far off the cut@@ out was selected .
in the social networks , Hab@@ te was then used to vir@@ al Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended with a back of 48 seconds and finished the 59@@ th place of 59 starters .
but it was rather the sporty figure that moved the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old took part in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian was a special start@@ up from the international swimming band .
this is distributed to make swimming in sub@@ ordin@@ ated countries well @-@ known .
since the sports@@ men run most sports@@ men , Hab@@ te wanted to make something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te makes it ready for the big race .
quickly , the first top names made the round .
some media signed him as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL the W@@ al . &quot;
in addition to a &quot; prosper@@ ity &quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ id &quot; The Sun &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; was funny .
his time , he stopped only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters fre@@ il , there didn &apos;t play any role .
compare with &quot; Eric the E@@ EL &quot; were also drawn .
at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , Eric Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i runs for media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the bu@@ oy@@ ancy of Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea as he had to compete in a run over 100 metres Freestyle .
fr@@ en@@ et@@ ically was fired Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i at that time .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old spent eight months before the Olympics and had never completed a long distance before the competition .

Tr@@ ump looks not so closely
Republi@@ can Presi@@ dential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump speaks on a elec@@ toral event in Florida .
if it &apos;s nothing to become the US President , Donald Tr@@ ump has already been an alternative vide@@ e .
he will then go on holiday .
loses Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential elections in November , would it be either fl@@ aps , or I have a very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the candidate of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in a telephone interview with the US TV station CN@@ BC .
if it is impossible for him in the end of reasons for the political correc@@ t@@ ness , it is ok , said Tr@@ ump .
thus he called the US President Barack Obama and the Candi@@ date in Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist mil@@ itia Islamic State ( IS ) .
in his party the most recently formed resistance is more resistance .

accidents - Bus slide in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ ack@@ n in Gr@@ um@@ my : eight injured
at an accident of a tour with 43 senior citizens , eight people have been injured in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ heard ( County Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injury , divided the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driving of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to give further information on the opposite L@@ aster , which drove part on the counter@@ way .
the bus came to the right from the street and sli@@ pped into a tr@@ ench as a spokes@@ person on the police Aur@@ i / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the location , the persons could not leave the bus no independent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ance cars and a emergency relief came to the accident at the national road 2 .
the last traveler were brought back from a line bus to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ ack@@ ner district P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the it@@ iner@@ ary .
the investigations called for the lor@@ ds and possible witnesses to report on the police .
the fees per cubic metre of waste are from 1st October 2016 for the area of Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ schenk@@ ahl 3,@@ 44 Euro ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf the se@@ wage fee will be increased at the latest , if appropriate improvement is necessary .
following a corresponding calculation of lim@@ estone the se@@ wage in Az@@ endorf then amounts to 4,@@ 37 euros per cubic meters .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported that , with the approval of the budget by the country and Kul@@ mb@@ ach , it was shown that for those se@@ wage covers .
the Bar@@ endorf Market is oblig@@ ated to maintain the assets under legal basis .
as of 1 October 2016 , citizens and industrial enterprises from Wel@@ fare , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg must take deeper into the pur@@ se .
the cost increases between 48 and 67 percent .
as administration manager Herbert Schmidt showed a new kal@@ k@@ ulation of the fees for waste management systems of the market town .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ l@@ apping and lower covers from the previous calendar period will be derived from October 2016 to September 2020 .
with all three basic san@@ itation increases , Schmidt founded that there are relatively small san@@ itation systems with a very low water waste disposal , which fly between 6@@ 800 and 12000 cubic metres per year .
thus , due to the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of more thousand Euros will be engraved .
in addition , the water san@@ itation is slightly decl@@ ining in all three systems .
continue in the past calendar period with all three plants not least enjoyed due to its age of san@@ itation and repair expend@@ itures .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the plants for Wel@@ fare , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth , and Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years .
in the se@@ wage plant Az@@ endorf , the mechanical ventilation system had to be exchanged due to an pollutants .
in the P@@ ump of Wel@@ fare , the nearly 20 years old conveying plants had to be overhau@@ led and during the pond environment , the se@@ wage sl@@ ud@@ ge has had to be installed and an additional v@@ ents to be installed in order to maintain water requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these extraordinary expend@@ itures came to these extraordinary expend@@ itures and maintenance costs which are considered to be considered in the new calendar period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs which were still significantly below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 .
stone cottages clearly shows that at low water san@@ itation in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance . &quot;
in this case , Schmidt , the market community of great entertainment costs were spar@@ ed during the waste plants over the past 20 years .
the situation for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned plants will continue to remain pre@@ lu@@ ent , especially since you could not expand the supply area of the waste disposal of Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al to expand these plants because it is a de@@ stru@@ ary facilities .

National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .

snap@@ chat &quot; An@@ ime &quot; effect as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature critic@@ ises
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is inspired by An@@ ime , but some ob@@ servers say that it is uns@@ en@@ si@@ bel compared to races .
with its filter tool , it enables snap@@ shots to change about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with ident@@ ities in such a way that borders the ab@@ sur@@ d .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein paintings .
the filters are distinctive , independent tool , which generate more than 30 million enhanced sel@@ enium per day .
all mis@@ er@@ ections are to the public .
snap@@ shots filters have withdrawn in the past criticism in which they accused , that the app Black@@ face wore or white skin would be able to act as a beauty deal .
when this week , some us@@ ans proposed a filter that gave them stro@@ kes , false teeth and d@@ uns@@ killed , there were some critics a ra@@ cial car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yel@@ lowing . &quot;
they asked whether these repeated contro@@ vers@@ ations have been added to a larger problem that the company has di@@ vest@@ ed with di@@ ver@@ ity .
the messages and indig@@ nation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and motherboard , one day after snap@@ chat , that it would have been de@@ activated the feature .
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was thought as an homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but foreign that have experienced rac@@ is@@ sm@@ us , remin@@ ded the filters of the viol@@ ating c@@ lich@@ és .
other refused to support the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani wrote , a Korean @-@ American art student whose sur@@ pris@@ ingly have been widespread over the photos , that the filters &quot; viol@@ ently and yel@@ low@@ ly said un@@ pleasant . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may be difficult with the counter@@ part of a very conflic@@ ting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ly secured , but that the yel@@ lowing of the yel@@ low@@ point was pulled away .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company which crosses this cultural Stol@@ per@@ ate .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless di@@ vers@@ eness and integration campaign , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we keep all in the hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who are in the stuff of various other than their older children - could be expected to expect Sen@@ si@@ vity .
when one of snap@@ shots is created , it is a lot more difficult to stay for a user , so that such things were un@@ noticed when it was previously the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Zh@@ u said in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Zh@@ u decided to work as a product manager and engineering in medium to delete their Snap@@ chat account , and ur@@ ged others to do the same .
in a set of medium and in a telephone interview , she said that they believe that road contro@@ vers@@ y reflected a lack of di@@ vest@@ ments with snap@@ shots with snap@@ shots .
Zh@@ u critic@@ ised the big part white , just male leadership and finished their attachment with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either I have no different representation of people with other skin colors , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chinese Zh@@ u , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors they work there , but not in positions , in which they are safe or well to say what to say about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
others share their opinion , an appeal , the Snap@@ chat has not left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures for diversity of employees and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s cultural reasons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but according to a spokes@@ man , the company has recently set a personnel responsible for focusing population groups and on internal integration projects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zh@@ u said that she will be closed her snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I ask myself if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military guidance on IS@@ IS Secret Information , unveil@@ ing the Committee of Congress
member of the United States Central Command changed the following information to record an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as it could have the actual states on site in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the Armed Services and the Wehr@@ bud@@ get@@ ary , reported by great dis@@ satisfaction under Central Command Intelligence , reported that their ass@@ ess@@ ments reported on the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , shortly C@@ enc@@ om , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , controls the U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; News service information , which were typically covered by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Commander for terrorism , were regularly admitted by the American efforts against terrorism as it had the actual states on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; cited a newspaper article to the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened to Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers will suffer if bad analyses will be presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ken Cal@@ ver@@ t , Republi@@ can Member of the House of Represent@@ atives &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guide error occurred in Cent@@ Com until the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows in detail consistent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct notice to change the government pointed to Obama , it shows how an@@ alysts were exposed to the pressure of its invent@@ ories , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or I@@ si@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , comments and statements in front of the Congress was clearly positive than the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Cent@@ Com members had publicly known that a military re@@ conquest of the mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , second @-@ second city of Iraq , remains under the control of Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , is much clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress held from Kansas , in a position . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the Central Command has changed the policy reports to play the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Republi@@ can called the Task Force into life after having been promised that an@@ alysts were wor@@ ried about the man@@ ipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed detection throughout the investigation .
in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are due to the General Insp@@ ector of the Ministry of Defence in G@@ ange .
the members of the News Services Committee published their own in@@ sights on Thursday that coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com ruled a revised trial for the preparation of im@@ pet@@ iti@@ al entries to I@@ si@@ l and the Iraqi safety services , &quot; the t@@ allest Democrats in the Com@@ mit , a member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff took part in a position .
this process , as Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the release of downstream reports , &quot; the mor@@ als under an@@ alysts and &quot; gave a little space for different opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and Democrats gave no evidence on a intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com an@@ alysts in regards to a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
preliminary results for the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times investig@@ ates investigations by the Pentagon &apos;s general practition@@ er , following complaints by Cent@@ Com an@@ alysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a pressing of the Pentagon , published in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on Congress while the investigations of the General Per@@ sp@@ urs will be still in the streets .
but he also gave us that &quot; experts sometimes also have di@@ spar@@ ing opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence welcomed a controversi@@ al discussion of these important topics of the national defence . &quot;
an investigation on the question of a successful air campaign in the American leadership of Iraq and Syria ( a asser@@ tion that has meanwhile been made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , the alleg@@ ations of last year did not have the question that President Obama can rely on the Central Command for volunteers in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya , and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the en@@ ger@@ min@@ ate information about the Islamic state recall the Islamic State of the Islamic State of more than ten years ago as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st contrary to the recommendations of many an@@ alysts just a small occupying troops in Iraq and to make a little time on the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the insur@@ rection against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , the team compet@@ ed for Mr. Hoo@@ kers after reporting government agencies that would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since this pro@@ vis@@ or@@ ic refin@@ eries were put into operation since these pro@@ vis@@ or@@ ic refin@@ eries were put into operation in order to sell oil on the Black market .
however , this decision was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ aging commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ized by members of the legisl@@ ature because of his revised positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
General Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced while the Central Command was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US win fourth match in the field hockey women , a show@@ down with great Britain .
one day after they had shot three goals during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually represent a memor@@ able performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they could not remember that ever did .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t include the people who keep your gates in memory .
however , they know that : the Americans are 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are the same in their group with the British in the first place that remains un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
great Britain and the United States will join the first round of the first round .
both teams are already qualified for the quarter @-@ final , the game will decide which the two teams will get in the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first place will take a little longer a bit longer from the track that the other group will run .
just like the game on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising tur@@ bel by their success story , four years after they landed in the past London Games on the last of 12 .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years of a hockey j@@ igsaw in their hands ( their two older sisters played the sports at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became a player in the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
you missed the Olympics in 2008 because it was not able to qualify for the header .
then came the year 2012 , where she and her team went all .
in the subsequent year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham was an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the N@@ ation@@ alt@@ e@@ ams and thus began to turn the things for better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we didn &apos;t had the work progress in London that we have now .
we &apos;ll be able to pl@@ uck the ru@@ der completely .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the door@@ step in the first half of the game with a return surcharge from the s@@ uture area .
India had gone to the game without victory in the tournament , but the team showed sur@@ pris@@ ingly tough and held the game stand from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until the game took into their hands .
they made a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the ball in the middle and brought the ball to the Americans to create a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the door@@ ke@@ epers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who so far had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
she has a run .
just as be@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but as good will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday .
am@@ id@@ st the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , Zen the tramp@@ ol@@ ins
wherever you are too late , the Olympic Games are too late .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel durable and in@@ sof@@ tened , a rapid relay between competition and stre@@ ches .
it is , when the Olympic tor@@ ch itself would be a burning staff , which is sufficient by wrist@@ bands to the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the tri@@ athletes .
you can not turn to the television , read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbours in the waiting area , without talking about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ cover@@ y or the dispute between Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there are Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games , and a women &apos;s black with dimples , would definitely be sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and well @-@ being @-@ being @-@ TV advertising when it would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner or even F@@ real .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fought in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines around gold .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the center , partly in the shade are the sports , which are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol shooting , Arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ w@@ ondo .
we will always have the breast@@ feeding and may reign it long .
but if I would like to make arguments for my particular lovers , then let me turn attention to the discre@@ et charm of the tr@@ amp .
although the tramp@@ ol@@ ines have already been a Olympic event since 2000 , when it had been in Sydney , it was the last 16 years so many that I asked , did not know that there is an Olympic Port .
this could also be regional Ig@@ nor@@ ance .
although the USA sent athletes to competition , it has never won a medal in the tramp@@ ol@@ ines and made a athl@@ ete until 2012 .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to divide the prices for men and the Chinese and the Canadian .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ on from Canada will defend their gold medal in London .
the tr@@ amp jump has a certain outer lateral leaf , partly because it sounds for the un@@ explained ear for a C@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ schule than those who sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should ad@@ mit that I am no expert , but only a few enthusi@@ ast .
it has hum@@ or@@ ist@@ ical potential - the cart@@ o@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never @-@ to @-@ wollen s@@ ali@@ ds - but also the gra@@ zie of turn@@ around and diving , the two sports , which combines it essentially .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , what so much means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; j@@ umping board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
battle jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need to shoot a number of falling movements ( turning , he@@ als and sal@@ tos ) before it landing on the feet .
they will be evaluated according to official Olympi@@ ads , after execution , difficulty level and &quot; flight time . &quot;
two @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the common Olympic V@@ ektor is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ on must continue in their stre@@ ches after gold , faster , upwards and above , sometimes up to the target , sometimes go back and back , down@@ wards and down@@ wards at the playground .
they are not only ch@@ ase the Zi@@ ell@@ in@@ ie or the starting grid , but also in the television transfer a further cav@@ ity : the world or the Olympics .
the targeted route is Nobel , ad@@ mi@@ red value , even fan@@ atic and it &apos;s enough to stir even an audience of tears .
but it &apos;s also what I &apos;m too tired when watching these games as something tired .
the trampoline offers a breathing cause .
the v@@ ector of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or her pr@@ enti@@ ful , seem@@ ingly heavy like a ast@@ ron@@ aut , go down to the top , then effortlessly back to the top .
also here is a competition , of course not without difficulty but during practice there is no h@@ ec@@ tic attack on the target , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ aming , elegant angle of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be .
qualifying and end of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in the streaming of 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 .
N@@ BC will leave the En@@ dr@@ on as part of a afternoon block from 14.00 on both days .
in the middle of the Olympia Man@@ ie , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one who probably will probably over@@ see in general tum@@ ult .
if the awareness of consciousness can only be achieved through the attack@@ ing and the obj@@ ection male athletes can be reached - like it was the male U.S. Turner at the The Wall Street Journal , - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects to move to air round , new fans .
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long a Verb@@ ally of the USA
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators , who demand political changes in Ethiopia , looking for violent resistance of the government .
witnesses say that only protest@@ ers were killed during cl@@ ashes with the police at Sch@@ uss@@ ing .
is Ethiopia just to break together ?
over the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid state of West Germany with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the last months , protests against the government went up against the government and spread themselves more areas .
last week , thousands of people stor@@ med into the streets and the fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations the answer of the government was innocent .
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen were killed on only un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators and killed .
in the movement , videos about the protests , probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security experts propose young people with st@@ sticks while these were forced to make a hand stand against a wall .
the Chief of the UN Authority for Human Rights demands a temporary examination now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was always difficult to hold this land and the future becomes even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is estimated that in Nigeria the most populated country of Africa and its stability is estimated at the west .
American military and secret services work closely with Ethiop@@ ians , in order to fight terror over the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help .
Ethiop@@ ian economy expanded in considerable speed .
his infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new P@@ end@@ ler@@ suit in the capital of Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia all other than a model for democracy , human rights organisations have continued to continue the repression of the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , whereby dis@@ sidents were effective for silence .
many were sent into exile or in prison , or put into the desert of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and do not have any other options except protest@@ ing , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ y@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiop@@ ian .
the entire youth are protest@@ ing .
a generation was protest@@ ant .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from the floor usage to the dig@@ ging handle in relation to power of the reg@@ ression of the coalition .
after a far @-@ reaching election last year , the reg@@ ering party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time , the voltages along the border to Erit@@ rea . a fight for these z@@ ag , controversi@@ al line asked hundreds of lives in June .
analy@@ st fear the separ@@ ati@@ sts , such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front , or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which were produced over the last years more or less , the tur@@ bul@@ ences could be explo@@ red and to be armed .
several factors explain why feelings of pro@@ vocation after years of age explo@@ de in the surface .
the first seems harm@@ less : Smartphones .
only in the last few years , many Ethiop@@ ian was able to communicate using the social media , since cheaper smartphones have been increasingly more common and improved their Internet services .
even if the government ob@@ sol@@ es the access to Facebook and Twitter , especially in regular intervals , so many people can still communicate on the internet pro@@ x@@ ies that they hide themselves .
several young Ethiop@@ ian believed that they assembled themselves together to protests .
the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oro@@ sei and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ nic@@ ities in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ sei and Am@@ har@@ as are not a natural enemies .
since its prosp@@ ective , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia , mainly Christian High countries , in politics and the economy , while the Oro@@ sei has explo@@ ited from which many Muslims are living and in Flach@@ land areas .
but this changes too .
&quot; we are going to coordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ sei .
the largest protests were held in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ sei .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ sei have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which accounts for around 6 percent of the population , and which are dominant in the military , in the trade and politics .
the third reason for the rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former vine leader , was up until his death in an un@@ sealed disease in the year 2012 17 years of Ethiopia .
he has been viewed as a tac@@ tical gen@@ ius , a man who could think about corners .
an@@ alysts say that he was particularly compens@@ ated in it , early signs of un@@ satis@@ fying and special officers to use opponents and do them un@@ dam@@ aging them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present regime is missing in this fundament@@ alist &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , Conf@@ lic@@ itor , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiop@@ ians : new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ on Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively un@@ clear reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
other than Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Arabia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ ah comes from the south .
analy@@ st say that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services that is controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more bleeding .
the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such an u@@ pro@@ ar in 2005 , after thousands of elections were protest@@ ing by the government , under@@ lying and stolen from the government .
during the following Raz@@ zi@@ en , many protest@@ ers were killed , even if it was less than in the last months and this time of the rest went relatively fast .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , as well as the new P@@ end@@ ler@@ suit , as well as for its meas@@ ur@@ able progress in poverty .
but obviously , this is not the inten@@ ving of the internal ab@@ norm@@ ality of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and she takes a dangerous eth@@ n@@ ical form .
last month protest@@ ing in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ic city , of Tig@@ ray guided shops and the hat@@ red towards the Tig@@ ray is always available in social media .
analy@@ st say that the protests are the US and other Western allies in an ec@@ uli@@ ar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as a base for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , even if they had recently closed that she closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , it does not want to break his ally in a vol@@ at@@ ile area .
&quot; this , &quot; Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; said , is a very thin hike . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his asser@@ tion Obama called IS@@ IS &apos; sar@@ cas@@ m .
Donald J. Tr@@ ump was trying to scatter the last contro@@ vers@@ y on Friday the last contro@@ vers@@ y , that his multi @-@ repeated claim , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State , not serious .
this clari@@ fication designed new questions concerning communication methods of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , whether he is able to communicate and under@@ stand@@ able to communicate with the American public .
it also brings his fellow soldier who ende@@ av@@ our to take him to protect him during an event@@ ful phase in protection in the event that he could not know .
after having made the appearance at a election event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump came back to the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted on Thursday that he really did not int@@ end to int@@ end the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said , he was simply neu@@ tered .
the breed was the contrary to the previous day , to which Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews , he meant the exc@@ use completely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hug@@ h He@@ wit@@ t has wanted to destroy this statement , rec@@ alled that Mr. Barack Obama wanted to destroy IS@@ IS , the republi@@ can candidate is not aware of it .
the last storm of Cr@@ iti@@ que on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tries to direct the focus of his campaign due to destruction of the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton kept talking about the economic situation in Michigan in this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this topic .
on Twitter , he asked that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found bor@@ ing his speech .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought Sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July , he moved to himself as he said , the Russians were supposed to be Mrs. Clin@@ t Ema@@ ils , but he explained later &quot; Natur@@ ally I thought the sar@@ cop@@ ic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the lingu@@ istic limits in politics and then return to ru@@ des .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages received from his fans how they arrive , and then , if , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to what reaction falls , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication sex@@ ist that are observed the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I think it is cle@@ ver enough to keep his statements , so that they can be interpreted in different ways and manner .
instead of the sound for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has taken away another tone , since its fra@@ gment has declined .
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a lead with a large lead in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ in @-@ head race in Florida .
during Mr. Tr@@ ump , he tries to uns@@ ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ vocation , he accused of understanding his critics , and to understand his testimonies , or to understand his hum@@ or .
but while he is reinforced in the focus of attention in the last months of its presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Scher@@ ze his lo@@ y@@ al Mit@@ stre@@ ak have brought to him in un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ant will be his statements .
Rud@@ olph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps , argu@@ ably , gave great effort to defend the candidate in an CN@@ N interview from Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said to the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that Obama IS@@ IS had an almost unknown , small organization , he called her back ben@@ chers , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to ar@@ gue that the government minist@@ ered to Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister , it allowed IS@@ IS allowed to spread out the situation in the Middle East .
before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and threw them forward with them on each of his words and against him vo@@ des@@ ingen@@ ious .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mo@@ cked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TV experts who try to understand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You cannot hear it ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats reported to Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps exc@@ use as a further evidence that he is un@@ suitable for the Presi@@ dential Office .
once ur@@ ged over the price from the market , cafe in Green@@ point comes back
ver@@ b Cafe was a ban@@ quet café in William@@ sburg , where you could only pay for a free Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices of his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front has been pushed .
the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , the ver@@ b in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of Cup@@ cakes .
in fact , there were the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I still cannot believe that CB@@ GB dead , the Chelsea Hotel is excluded and ver@@ b now is a soap business . &quot;
but if New York change is change , it is also new fin@@ ning .
a Cafe Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts cards , but still has some of the same employees and a similar atmosphere .
coffee is still good .
the new owner of Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ term employee of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new caf@@ és .
he began working in Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
as a customer , a customer offered to provide money for a new outside , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , kept much more .
ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the excav@@ ation bought the same es@@ presso equipment model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he would also wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu , sand@@ wi@@ ches are with bac@@ on and cheese and there are yar@@ ns like cap@@ tures and s@@ aut@@ é onions .
there are nature conservation .
the café is served no beer more , but there are fresh ju@@ ices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ guez told that he noticed a st@@ ately current of the old masters .
&quot; many old customers have also been displac@@ ed by awards from William@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived early in William@@ sburg and visited the ver@@ b regularly .
even after they had moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way to itself .
after the ver@@ b had closed , she gave a while the coffee is on , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was clear that it was at coffee and at the culture in the case that pleased me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they drink coffee again , even if they have ordered a bl@@ ended C@@ hai Tea this day instead of its usual ic@@ ile Tea , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and faithful client since the start of the publisher in 2003 .
he went there before the work , and he ordered always the same .
&quot; I came out after seven , each day as a Swiss watch clock and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said .
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal receives still its usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he had no gro@@ ove that the soap has taken the old business room .
in fact , the owner of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie is actually used to produce a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold bo@@ iled coffee of the cafes as ingredient .
&quot; I think we will go down on their offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez .
and the traditional , Polish citizens Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ guez , and Rodri@@ guez said that he would have to present them soon , so that his new neigh@@ bors welcome you .
the site also has a further advantages .
a local saf@@ t@@ locally wants to fill the cold bo@@ iled coffee into the bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café is expanded to a nearby building .
for many customers , a new ver@@ b is enough to get their old favorites .
Joseph W@@ itt was his ancest@@ ry , and said that he was destroyed in the ground , when the café ended .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the bed of the loc@@ als and the beast felt a new coff@@ ees like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pri@@ ming food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascent to the President Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took his lunch in the Oval Office .
President Roosevelt a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined delic@@ acy with Fifth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water@@ signs soup .
his menu on this day was some modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , potato pur@@ ée and as dessert a p@@ ud@@ p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with the people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans , how they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food hist@@ ori@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CH@@ OP Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acted by the Chinese cuisine in the USA , while drawing in their book &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their latest collaboration , &quot; A permanent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in Har@@ per publishing house , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a repor@@ ter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sandwich shop for dinner , a small , small snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in store since the stock market in 1929 .
Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a cream cheese with Oli@@ v@@ enst@@ ück@@ chen , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with potato pur@@ ée and vegetables .
as the repor@@ ter he ordered , this was the pair of a discussion about the food in the era of great depression .
&quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man .
there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from a ingredient and a bit cheaper that make the ingredient .
imagine to eat as many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
CO@@ E grin@@ d .
&quot; it must be in the stomach as lead , &quot; he said .
in the years before great depression was the table in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women bo@@ iled for male field workers and it was served fresh@@ ly b@@ aked past@@ el for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans , who sent the country during the first World War of food to hunger . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; shows the ways of which the country went with it , no more the Schl@@ ar@@ aff@@ enland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was time , in the food for the Americans , a central , an@@ oun@@ ded theme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e Co@@ e , why he and his wife would write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new bud@@ get@@ ary diet was the same as the new Bud@@ get@@ di@@ bility : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and cass@@ ettes were re@@ compens@@ ated as &quot; wonderful way , eating remains recur@@ r@@ assing , &quot; noted Zi@@ egel@@ man , because coo@@ ks un@@ appet@@ ite ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry heat .
meat , which was the core of American cuisine for years , became a rare over@@ fourth luxury .
distinctive mix@@ es have been tried , as a cal@@ orie rich and nutr@@ itious satisfaction was observed in front of taste or even healthy kitchen .
during their research for the book , which also comprises recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish from this era , fried onion with pe@@ an@@ ut butter , too .
&quot; it was not a popular addition at the lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e .
Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onion cannot fit each other .
it was typical for many of the household goods .
as never before , since then , household management - including Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 , is the essence of the country .
by taking recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encourage women to become &quot; domestic don@@ ors &quot; and the challenge to transform P@@ amp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with carrots in delicious meals .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a celebration of historic L@@ eck@@ ed@@ issen .
in particular , reports about the answer of the government to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ Cake @-@ Catering possible .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farms in his kitchen , he d@@ anced as the million heavy man of the world in which he became .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in an almost gilded operating room and contributed a Smoking .
he was great realistic .
President Roosevelt may perhaps be aware of the same mist@@ akes if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to stat@@ u@@ ate a stamp with his stomach .
as described in the book , the concerns of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flav@@ ours of Mrs. Roosevelt , that the White House produced the bor@@ ing food in Washington , but also one of the best prepared at the tro@@ upe . &quot;
many of the species from the era of great depression , deal with food , was rejected , once the country got on the legs .
the legacy is based on our continuing focus on calories and food , Zi@@ egel@@ man said , as well as science on food was applied .
the pair gave heed to the letter written by Zi@@ egel@@ mans @-@ in @-@ law in law - for example , how they could not take away foods .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e .
Zi@@ egel@@ man remin@@ ded : &quot; they made people really ill . &quot;
there were the wind@@ sh@@ ank .
after the plates were evacu@@ ated at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they pulled and Co@@ e a dessert which she had prepared at home : the pl@@ au@@ dul@@ ent , the President Roosevelt at noon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ une W@@ hip &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a usual tri@@ ck to miss a modest name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no proposed cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
each appeared somewhat contra@@ sts a spoon into the teeth , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber .
unfortunately , it was not bad .
CO@@ E won three times a night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ get@@ te &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bom@@ b Attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he continued his own life to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Omar dedicated his life in Syria .
he ris@@ k@@ ed everything to save her life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died even at a Fass@@ bomb attack by the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the &quot; White Hel@@ mets &quot; , a civil protection group , which has been saved according to the image newspaper so far more than 60,000 humans .
29@@ 00 Vol@@ unte@@ ers put their own life on the game to draw people out of bom@@ bed houses and to aff@@ ord the first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civilian , which shows him with a 11 @-@ hour rescue from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians to the bright symbol figure in the grave of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a mighty man , he has never seen himself , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For me is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die , save life , I think that God sees a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before Omar himself had an attack on the victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria .
the hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter have rejected four fac@@ ial bombs above the Alz@@ adia District , one was filled with chlor@@ ert gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now able to remove the remains of the bomb , lest children to play , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quotes his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the dead@@ ly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terror@@ ists .
Greenland : the oldest ed@@ dy is nearly 400 years old
more rarely sight .
Greenland &apos;s hair usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after a research on board the S@@ anna .
it was born in 16@@ 24 and swim with a fine of 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie got up only with 150 years of offspring .
the Greenland harbour at the bottom of the North Atlantic ocean , in an hour it comes to an average just 1,@@ 220 meters .
only when it comes to pass , the five metre long animal accelerates to a massive 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a Rob@@ be .
but that of lon@@ el@@ iness , lifestyle seems to be a sponsor@@ ing concept for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the professional journal &quot; Science &quot; in any case from Greenland , who could be 392 years old .
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock this life span that means for cycl@@ ones a world record .
indeed , the ev@@ olu@@ tionary biolog@@ ist argu@@ ably that Greenland is st@@ ew@@ ed .
only lack the evidence .
Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks are difficult to observe and finally , in the ice sea , they live mainly in the Eis@@ meer , in front of the thin@@ ly populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ b@@ ard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they dive in the surface usually only in winter .
researchers have to know about the lifestyle of Greenland .
you would like to have a time of time , they found six animals with one transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ b@@ ard .
in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another one had seized the or@@ bone of a young iron ore .
possibly they hunt them sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the reason of the ice @-@ me@@ ar and seek cad@@ aver , which sw@@ ings from higher water layers to bottom sw@@ ings .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ b@@ ard in front of Greenland &apos;s depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimeters long , while the largest 502 @-@ centi@@ meter is measured .
to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the Lin@@ sen@@ core of Ha@@ ie with carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens is formed already before the birth of Ha@@ ie , which the proteins are not renewed later .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the l@@ entil core .
their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , as nuclear weapons testing major quantities of this radio@@ active carbon in the atmosphere .
at 220 centimeters long , the l@@ entil core contained a low surplus in carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapon , it is likely to have celebrated his 50th birthday in its investigation in 2012 .
in their lens core , all larger Greenland H@@ ie had a normal carbon @-@ 14 levels , which is formed by cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ Clock showed an age of 335 years , while the record @-@ shar@@ k was even 392 years old while the record @-@ shar@@ k was to be 392 years old .
that Greenland @-@ females only got after@@ mat@@ ured when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to arrange an age .
since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined at 156 years , Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie became apparent at least one and a half centuries of time .
this should also be the world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live mainly in icy waters , is no co@@ incidence .
even the previous record holder , a 211 @-@ year @-@ old Greenland expedition in which bac@@ on on the neck was a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on top , was caught on Alaska .
due to low temperatures , the organ@@ ism of the living creatures often runs on Spar@@ kasse .
so you mature later - and al@@ ers slower .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals often are often big .
the volume is much faster than its surface , including the animal heat .
the heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than in a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal is so far more dangerous and should focus on it as possible as possible as many descendants as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ev@@ olu@@ ologist Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein declares as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very big animal should invest its resources rather in a long life .
building floor in double pack
with topics around the building , the municipal council in the youngest meeting is concentrated in the most recent meeting .
with relief , the Committee adopted by Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally , the marketing of the most recent living area can commence . &quot;
after developing the plot , par@@ zel@@ li@@ cles and closing questions , the sale of plots in the residential areas &quot; street trail &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area of Bin@@ der@@ straße - Construction section 1 ) is interested in interested nothing in the way .
the Municipal Council is convinced that the pet@@ us of the rural estate in the rural and peaceful residence Schön@@ au young families and equipment .
as it &apos;s name , construction consent can be published immediately in the town hall , on the awarding of the par@@ c@@ els is expected to advise in his September session .
in order to settle in@@ quiries to the res@@ ett@@ lement of further commercial companies connected to the creation of work@@ places , the municipal council decided to change the municipal budget for partial areas in the spring of this year .
in the sub@@ time area , there will be two plots in the area of state road 2@@ 112 in the area of sub@@ contrac@@ eption .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
the City of Main was therefore competing in the competition with Paris , Dublin , and Luxembourg , the best chances to attract jobs and firms .
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt am most likely to benefit from the Bre@@ x@@ it vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the Compet@@ ence financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W .
according to the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is un@@ certain whether money will continue to operate from financial transactions throughout the EU .
for the so @-@ called EU @-@ Pass it is enough to date the approval in Great Britain .
the use just major U.S. banks .
several banks have already announced jobs , jobs .
the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expects 10,000 new jobs at the Main Event in five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks of the euro zone , as well as further important authorities like the European insurance company E@@ IO@@ PA and the Risk of ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) have its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector less than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the nearby bank is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision of the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg remains a great fund industry , cut down as well as Dublin for the infrastructure .
Frankfurt am significantly easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
in addition , the city is available with slightly available commercial real estate ads .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the Seine , rent a top @-@ class commercial real estate of 50 percent higher than the Main Event .
in addition , Frankfurt provides a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure , as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the company coun@@ sel@@ ing Mer@@ cer stand up the city seven , Luxembourg on No.@@ 19 , Dublin on No.@@ 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if life is a question of pre@@ ferences : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its strong position as a financial centre for the European inland market , Frankfurt might have further banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the I@@ W is decre@@ asing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but despite the Bre@@ x@@ it vote , London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe , my economic for@@ scher .

Gilead receives legal costs of the hepatitis C Patent At@@ stre@@ it with Mer@@ ck
a US judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc are entitled to a refund of the legal costs which are created from the H@@ epat@@ its C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June Gilead was delivered by a damages deposit amounting to $ 200 million for the breach of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which stood in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster medicines S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Harv@@ oni of Gilead , after a US judge issued a sample of patches with flaws on Mer@@ cks , including Mein@@ ei@@ des and other in@@ eth@@ ical acts .
in case of the law@@ suit filed on Thursday US official judge Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to decree of the costs which were created during the defense of the fever .
Mer@@ ck tries to draw with Gilead to cure the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs , which can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to the year 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck took over against each other and owned by the laboratory , Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vi@@ r , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .

Clin@@ t earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal government taxes
Hill@@ ary Clinton released their tax statement for 2015 , these y@@ ielded an income of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , Clin@@ t USD 1 million donated for charity purposes , mainly to Clinton Foundation ; the former president Bill Clinton generated a revenues of USD 3 million from the publishing house Simon &amp; Sch@@ uster for her book on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clin@@ t candidate for the vice president , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published in the last ten years together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to focus on financial transparency , &quot; by Clin@@ t Kamp@@ agn@@ enh@@ el@@ fer@@ ro in J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i .
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hidden behind false talking and rep@@ urch@@ ased with regard to his previous promises to publish its tax .
it is common for US presidential candidate to publish their tax data , although they are not obliged by law for this purpose .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers argu@@ ed as a reason for his ref@@ usal to test a tax examination by the tax authorities .
&quot; they are at the train , &quot; Clinton &apos;s election campaign in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , referring to the publication of the presidential candidate in the Democrats .
on Thursday Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special advis@@ ers , to CN@@ N , that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the tax checks are not completed .
Tr@@ um@@ ps critic , among others also the republi@@ can Presi@@ dential candidate of the Year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already abandoned its ref@@ usal questions regarding wealth , its corporate and various other connections , in particular with Russia .
Clinton already dis@@ appears on the subject and published a video on the Internet on Friday , in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump took up his tax statement .
on Thursday , she spoke the subject also during a speech to the economy in Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in the last decades and to publish its tax claims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the multitude . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
polit@@ ico has reported that Tr@@ ump has paid no or very little taxes during the 1990s , and a business journalist for the New York Times on Friday a number of tax collectors and tax advis@@ ers who could still be the case .
federal government has become a theme in the election campaign .
Clinton also supports a regulation , which is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren buffet , the saf@@ est would that people earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during a election event for Hill@@ ary Clinton in the past week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka required buff@@ ets , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ et@@ glomer@@ ate has its headquarters here , Tr@@ ump to exchange their tax reviews .
Buff@@ et said that he was also under@@ gone to a control test of the IRS and Tr@@ ump &quot; fear &quot; in front of voters and not before the tax authorities .
Clin@@ t Campaign has published tax statement until the year 2007 .
the Clin@@ t , who now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , are on average an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0,5 % .
the tax statement of the 2015 Clin@@ t from 2015 showed that this only USD 100 worth of their income is considered to be the majority of all Americans .

con@@ doms with chili powder , fire@@ men fo@@ ster dance eleph@@ ants
natural protected in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x species to stop eleph@@ ants about it - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with chili powder .
the method has proved to be effective as effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which already had the idea to intensi@@ fied their funding in the north of Tanzania , having trained volunteers in the north of Tanzania , a wav@@ ed four @-@ step method for protection of their houses and harvest@@ ing to viol@@ ate animals .
previously many Spe@@ ers have used to defend itself .
Friday is Wel@@ fare is dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed the tool@@ kit , we could observe the tool@@ kit within this commun@@ es , whereby it is much more obvious that they cannot harm the eleph@@ ants of their fields without damage , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message .
the first two steps include the light of eleph@@ ants with a tor@@ ch and the bub@@ bles in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if he is not sh@@ aken , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chili cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
chili powder with earth is wrapped together with a fire@@ work in a con@@ dom , whose end has to be turned on to the spark plug .
when it is ign@@ ite , the con@@ dom is bur@@ ying with a button and spra@@ yed fine dust on chili powder in the air .
a hint right usually already in order to hunt the eleph@@ ants .
one last possibility is a ship@@ pers that sho@@ ots a golf course in the air and causes a no@@ isy , bright explosion .

Jewish director be@@ ats Berliner Hotel , because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed according to &quot; Arab &quot; Dest@@ ru@@ ction - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots reveal a media release after he had betrayed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin has not listed as an Israeli pre @-@ election , since there were Arabic guests according to a staff . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of Hol@@ oc@@ al@@ documentary &quot; Shoah &quot; sent his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by giving a open letter to the german newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel at the fore@@ front list of the hotel .
however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be accessed directly from the hotel rooms .
how is it possible in the year 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers an opportunity to select Israel via an own call center .
after a declaration , the director returned to the hotel reception .
the answer , which he received there , &quot; sho@@ cked him &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
the hotel announced that the measure must be a deliber@@ ate decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
the reason , behind it , dis@@ band@@ ed more gro@@ ove in the director .
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arab@@ s and they have asked that the pre@@ fix will be deleted , &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted .
Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace &quot; that covers the South German newspaper .
we were horri@@ fied by this event and crash@@ es .
that is really excellent .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain , is even greater confusion .
the need of no explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the ministers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a quite big reson@@ ance on the Internet , where people called the whole of a sc@@ and@@ al .
some of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel announced that there would have been an alleged country of arab@@ ic guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I called it in another article in which it was pointed out that the hotel is located on a no@@ bles Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly found all the charges of themselves and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Lanz@@ mann , the mirror reports . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct instruction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Israel not to record the rapid selection list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited the South German newspaper one speaker of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the di@@ alling code is added to the country .

the police set Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de against demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began to describe as police officers attempted to describe the students that led by the police Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their best over the plans .

trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT business
with the repe@@ al of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trading set between Moscow and Teheran rose by 7@@ 0.9 percent .
since the international sanctions was lifted up against Iran , the interests grew strongly on pages of Russian companies in the country , divided the ambassador to the country .
Russian companies take existing connections with Iran , while new companies are prepared to pro@@ cure access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the further trade structure is one of the largest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it noted that the trading set between Russia and Iran were in the first five months of the year 2016 by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million in comparison to the same period .
in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran , and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the trade fair was reached by ship@@ ments of machines , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador .
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan runs this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , the Russian foreign representatives issued around 35,000 Vis@@ as , primarily associated with Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran &apos;s top 20 countries reached the number of places in Russia .
one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists will be broken down from the last year , &quot; he said .
at the same time , only relatively few Russians attend Iran , something from the Ambassador , hopes that it will change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I personally recommend the visit to the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d to have the monuments of the old Persian civil@@ ization in a good condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Scot@@ s@@ man Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ ms into home when Br@@ it err@@ illa Gold for cycling
Scotland Call@@ um Sk@@ inner &apos;s last night in the male team @-@ spr@@ int in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to glory when the British team def@@ ended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took a role that his Land@@ smann Sir Chris Ho@@ y made himself to E@@ j@@ y . he made the legend , as he stor@@ med his home to enter a victory from favorites New Zealand .
four years ago , England claimed a sho@@ cking victory while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympi@@ ag@@ ol@@ d@@ med@@ alli@@ s .
they repeated the trick , after they took place in March at the railway World Championships in London , despite the back@@ drop of Ho@@ ys , just a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the substitute for Jamie Staff .
they did this time in time than execution .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap that tried K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton .
Sk@@ inner was the man where they remained , when they saw the potential in the sh@@ all@@ ots that now un@@ fol@@ ds .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - who won four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner sitting in the qualification round a Olympi@@ ar@@ ord , but also won the New Zealand stand in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his lap , it was close to his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner .
a strategic change made a major portion of transformation , with the execution in a higher gear , to slow it and allow it to slow it and keep it to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y saw from his position as BBC expert from and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when it climbed to the podium .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I am just here to do my best and to make a name .
in the En@@ dr@@ ens , we set up a Olympi@@ ar@@ ord and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 on the page Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ ds issued that he fell to the railway after a weak start .
he returned this statement later , and there was no obj@@ ection of England Ri@@ val@@ en .
with such a superior victory there was no problem for this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels with all the GB flags on the Tri@@ bun@@ e as London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we came together as a team in the last three months .
we are so bad with so many world titles that it was incredible , again at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation which won seven of 10 titles in Beijing as well as in London .
if this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect a successful five days at the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form of Kenn@@ ys it is possible to repeat the victory of three Olympic gold medals in a contest .
this would be the same thing for Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who also was born on March 23 ( apparently , Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - an yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the cheese of Ho@@ y is equal .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint , which starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old made from Bol@@ ton , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always best .
one can win with his colleagues .
it feels something to win alone to win .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he wins two more gold medals , he should be defeated to the K@@ nights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ alli@@ sts on the day , but there were another good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ kel W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four @-@ kilometre race .
they came in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 942 am the destination .
the World Record , who won gold in London in 2012 , was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 659 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held today on the second day of the contest , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on security .
yesterday , he had disp@@ uted yesterday with reference to the qualification , when the func@@ tion@@ aries under@@ took him to measure its height .
in the respective women &apos;s competition , which is continued tomorrow and ended , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team is leaving its strong railway team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a shot at Med@@ als .
after a truly exceptional representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio had gone down .
it played in the background , as the re@@ sign@@ ation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April am@@ id@@ st in the midst of sex and mo@@ b@@ b@@ ing@@ ers as well as the retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ leton .
however , if you see the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite soon afterwards , when the legendary reputation would have reached its peak at the perfect moment .
future of the melting of Portland due to the repe@@ al of the energy contract
the future of aluminium melt from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - standing on the game , since the system operator will termin@@ ate the energy supply contract , giving all the delivery orders , which over@@ took the supplier of energy companies .
this step followed by the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further sub@@ ventions to operate the plant .
a maximinum payout of 20 years runs out in November .
up to 2000 work@@ places in the facility of AL@@ CO@@ A in Portland stand on the game .
not less than 2000 work stations -@@ direct and indirect - could be end@@ anger@@ ed at a closing time .
in addition , it could come to Domin@@ o@@ more , since the melting was consumed around 10 percent of the total power generation Vict@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 AL@@ CO@@ A closed the Point Henry melt , which led the last year to a closing of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant .
the melting of AL@@ CO@@ A in Portland loses money and ris@@ k@@ ed a closure .
this step follows the lon@@ gl@@ asting spec@@ ulations about the future of the system , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the system .
AG@@ L , which provides the large aluminum melting with his Lo@@ y Yang A power station in Lat@@ robe Valley , divided that three other owners will termin@@ ate their contracts .
the complex is located in the majority of a joint venture of AL@@ CO@@ A and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p smaller propor@@ tions hold .
&quot; AG@@ L is going to continue to continue the plant in Portland , which means another physical demand for electricity through the melting sheet , &quot; divided the company with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continued to continue that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; backup business &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be in force since November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month period of notice that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L assumes that contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenue &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the current supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impact on the revenues of AG@@ L from G@@ J 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong sales markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L reported that it has already written the value of the contracts in his annual financial statements of $ 187 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of a cancellation &quot; .
AL@@ CO@@ A said that the decision to book the tre@@ aties , the &quot; Sk@@ ill Al@@ co@@ as ... the melting of power or power supply to ensure the melting of the melt . &quot;
the U.S. company said that in 2010 it has concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who would have come into force in November this year even though it is still a declaration , why it has returned from the contract .
analy@@ st war@@ ns due to the bad economic conditions of the industry in front of the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near Newcastle .
in reference to the statements of the Analy@@ st at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland must consume about 900 meg@@ awatt hours a year .
if both plants disappear from the market , this would mean significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
and for us as a generator , this would not be good , &quot; he said .
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the Sept@@ ember@@ edition of the Vog@@ ue
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ erin and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner C@@ lan@@ s Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted sept@@ in issue of the US Vog@@ ue .
K@@ end@@ all , the ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der is and at Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on their Inst@@ ag@@ ram account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people whom I love , brought me the sight of this co@@ vers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unveil@@ ing of the Co@@ vers followed a bizar@@ re ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ her@@ an &apos;s family ) , which ends the entire kar@@ aoke bands on On@@ es and Ca@@ it@@ l@@ yn , as well as in the presence of the most popular show bi@@ z @-@ On@@ k@@ ite and producers of Ke@@ eping up Ry@@ an Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , which ends with a classical turn . they all have a surprise party .
this represents almost every birthday party of a children &apos;s program ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the set , &quot; you suspected that we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of an animation at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to leave their other girls somehow to this Public@@ ity .
with regard to the September issue of the Vog@@ ue , a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans began with regard to the Sept@@ ember@@ edition of the Vog@@ ue .
K@@ end@@ alls big sister Kim likes them what the Vog@@ ue Cover is beaten ( they and her husband Kan@@ ye West were to see on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September edition is a league for itself .
the Sept@@ ember@@ Edition is the most popular edition of the year for Vog@@ ue .
with a size that resem@@ bles a picture band as a fashion magazine , the edition attrac@@ ts a large number of advertising messages ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were published by the 8@@ 32 pages of the rolling 615 pages of advertising ) .
the unveil@@ ing of his Co@@ ver@@ stars is expected to be ad@@ dic@@ tive in the last two years of the magazine before the official announcement of the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover , drew near Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Moss .
in recent years , more &quot; celebr@@ ities , the mod@@ ells &quot; as &quot; Models , the celebr@@ ities are &quot; on the cover .
Oscar @-@ Prize lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was born in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even at low chance that Mr@@ s J@@ enner - which is described by the magazine as the &quot; passage model &quot; of their generation - under the previous category , it is in good company .
these celebr@@ ities are not related to famous individuals or reality stars or young people of today who know how to get a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if it &apos;s all to be denom@@ in@@ ator ) .
they are truly talented women who draw themselves in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had a publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like success every one .
with its reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ese &apos;s position in fashion world was always somewhat cl@@ amped .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Modell Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and their Kol@@ leg@@ in Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called them &quot; the mist@@ akes of the moment . &quot;
these feelings sal@@ ted again , when the message came out with the publication J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vog@@ ue Cover .
but on the mis@@ sm@@ ut it seems to pass at the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the Sept@@ ember@@ edition of the Vog@@ ue .
it is the true meaning of the word a superb model .
she runs for Marc Jacobs .
you are advertising for your footprint of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all their sisters sell your images from their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sells pictures from Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine LO@@ VE .
and in their leisure time it is visible in reality TV . presumably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
municipal centres indicate yearly 16@@ 0,000 people per year
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country ob@@ itu@@ aries of the country are rejected annually by the community centres , while the industry has already been made to the effects of another medium @-@ shortest transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land three of five people - mostly older people , immig@@ rants , helpful workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for od@@ or@@ less Del@@ og@@ ations and similar games - with their request to free legal advice and legal conf@@ is@@ itions .
legal services of the municipality , which are already exc@@ essi@@ vely le@@ ached , make for further cuts .
as of June , next year , these legal centres are planned to lose another 30 percent of their federal resources .
the Director of the Municipal Council of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Cent@@ res accounted for thousands of people each year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation without repe@@ aling the decision of the Federal Government would only be worse .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land municipal centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means thousands of people of important services that you need to be denied , &quot; he said .
people who left violent relationships , people with in@@ over@@ looked and op@@ pressed debts , families who were dismissed by divi@@ ding workers - all these people have problems right way and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help that they need .
in June 2017 , the Federal Government will be shortened by 30 percent as of June 2017 , meaning that thousands of helpful people from Que@@ ens@@ land to be forced to agree with legal problems without any help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for the General and Federal Minister of Federal Minister and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to raise this medium @-@ shortest , so that people may need help to have legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the sover@@ eign government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds to the national average .
it is now at the time to view the needs of the community centres and its customer base , and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government is investing in this important work .

Berlin / Schwerin : survey of the Länder @-@ Ele@@ ctions : SPD and CDU lose
in the elections of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , significant losses for the g@@ overning party SPD and the CDU .
this is a representative survey of Outlook research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Picture &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition might continue to rule over the north , this is not possible after restructuring values in Berlin .
in both federal states , the SPD would have been the strongest party and would have a good chances to move the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD collap@@ sed from 3@@ 5.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party remains just under the CDU that could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is fought between the left and the Af@@ D .
the Lin@@ ke should be 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the country .
despite a slight losses of 6 per cent ( previous 8.7 percent ) , the gre@@ enery would return to the heav@@ y@@ day country .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP are not included in the coun@@ table each with 3 percent .
according to the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties , the SPD gained only 23 per cent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
they saw still behind the green with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( before 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented at a time of 14 per cent for the first time in a member of the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope to return , the pir@@ ates would be missed by contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and Internet in micro@@ scope : the Nokia Communic@@ ator came into the market 20 years ago .
today the successor domin@@ ates the world - his manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was th@@ icker and bigger , it was therefore not good in hand .
on the contrary , it was quite kno@@ ck .
the built @-@ in memory was at the beginning eight Meg@@ abytes , and this would be enough for about two sel@@ ors with high resolution .
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gig@@ abytes .
the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; came exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , in the business - and it was the first smartphone .
for a few euros , lovers can buy the tools still online , but they come from the Stone Age of the Internet .
but 20 years ago the Communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier on the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as a &quot; office in the West@@ ent@@ bag format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be broadcast a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and receive , also by fax was the Communic@@ ator .
even the access to websites was possible by HTML browsers , even though tor@@ ch slowly .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone was similar to a laptop .
then a small keyboard and black @-@ white screen took place .
the price was quite proud of the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros .
the average price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 Euro in 2015 .
no one could have in August 1996 that the Communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story when not for Nokia .
the mobile phone card of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented Des@@ aster , finally sold to Microsoft at Microsoft .
today , the market rule over the market today , which were all a lot later .
always and everywhere , that &apos;s today for very many people daily .
in 2015 there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
sold around 1.4 billion devices , Samsung and Apple sold alone 555 million pieces .
the worldwide sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
to this end , the well @-@ running business of the countless app provider and t@@ elecommun@@ ication accounts are coming .
around the smartphone , all industries have been developed .
the decisive breakthrough for mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time , Apple releases Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World &apos;s launch of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he spoke three tools in one : a music player , a phone and an Internet communications , all with touch screen easy to use .
Apple began in Apple , still today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market had to see .
finally , they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
we now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the Smartphone is a self @-@ sensitivity 20 years after his invention .
on average every German now sees 88 times a day on the phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to learn all the Smartphone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said straight Jan@@ ina sphere , in the Siemens Executive Board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must bro@@ aden the Olympic spirit and He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row is not only available in our local municipalities and throughout London but bring to the whole country and prosper@@ ity .
for me , this is the largest attraction of He@@ ath@@ rows , just as it was in 2012 in London , when we used a large effort to ensure that all our nations and regions are benef@@ ited from the games .
the Olympic Games brought great advantages for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be back again by creating new possibilities for local and companies in the vicinity of He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local congregations we will already create 10,000 new apprentices , 40,000 new jobs and youth unemployment at the airport environment .
as they were ahead in London 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of the extension of He@@ ath@@ rows is too large .
I told me that England is never going to be ready for the games and we will present ourselves on the world stage .
the two fl@@ yers had wrong 2012 and they are also wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to over@@ ride , but He@@ ath@@ row answered each question .
like the Olympic Games He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual infrastructure project .
extension is an opportunity to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion to funny growth and a legacy of skills and jobs to both the airport as well as in the UK .
we have created a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has been generating a £ 11 billion expensive infra@@ structures program in time and budget , from the T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , which was built in the middle of the two frequencies test drive .
now they are ready to deliver a third @-@ cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investments .
the London Games of 2012 was a great success for GB and I &apos;m confident that the extension of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time that we direct this Olympic spirit and He@@ ath@@ row to expand our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that can be proud of England .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ atz @-@ und Maus@@ spiel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning display block
according to one of the software manufacturers we earn attempts to handle the display block , a &quot; Kat@@ z@@ - and Maus@@ oleum . &quot;
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced , Ad@@ block Plus would block a blo@@ g@@ post in which it could say that users could update their filter in the program to block advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that his des@@ kt@@ op@@ page would change the coding in regarding his advertis@@ ements to see it displays on display that part of the page advertising is to be very difficult .
but Ad@@ ad announced that it has found a new way to handle the new codes .
in a blo@@ g@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams noted that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her struggle between the in@@ ev@@ itable Open Source Community and the Um@@ bre@@ eders already has been in G@@ ange , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest company has left the fight for social media in the fight , is a strong inde@@ struc@@ tive display for the industry .
according to a study conducted by the last year of Pa@@ w@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people are lock@@ ers ; almost four times so much in 2013 .
with 1,@@ 03 billion daily active users who have access their mobile devices on Facebook , accounts for 84 percent of the value .
the company has been on display block on Desktop PCs , since mobile display block doesn &apos;t have any effect on fac@@ eb@@ ooks mobile app for the social network and inst@@ ag@@ ram , divided a speaker with .
advertisement on your desktop PC makes a sufficient amount of revenues , so Facebook appears to be worthwhile as worthwhile as worthwhile .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad pre@@ ference &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be updated to have the people more control over them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Facebook claimed that Ad@@ just would have a new filter ar@@ ous@@ ed because they would also block content on the page , which are no advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for users , there is no positive experience , therefore we are planning to discuss the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; divided a spokes@@ person on Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
display block are a silent means , why we have concentrated instead on developers such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , to lay more control into the hands of the people .
woman having committed suicide on Swiss highway
the sacrifice was at the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls for witnesses after a woman in early morning hours on Thursday at a suspected self @-@ suicide powered by several vehicles on a fre@@ eway .
the incident occurred on the A1 motorway near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
a woman put a woman in the Dun@@ kl@@ en &quot; in an act of desp@@ air &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , said the police in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a Swiss lady at the age of 49 , who was over by several vehicles , including a truck , to kill themselves .
she died on site .
several drivers have already been taken , but some are not yet identified , the police , which , as well as every witness of the pre@@ valent are to report to report .
it was opened investigations , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , divided G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter from the Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to wait if any of the driver will be displayed .
was a cl@@ ash avoid@@ able ?
this is something that the prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter .
two similar cases in the last five years show that the driver will not be moved to responsibility .
in each of the two cases - where one person ran in the Dun@@ es on the highway - was decided that motor@@ ists do not need to go out that a pedestri@@ ans in the middle of the night runs on the highway , as it was in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ eman was acquitted on the cas@@ ual killing , having killed a man and killed in August 2014 of a night on the A1 , near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had drunk , and has become conscious of the road .
the Court found that the polic@@ emen -- which had responded to an emergency call -- on a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the street had an &quot; perfect extraordinary and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; said the judges .
everyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges , should report on the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Klim@@ am@@ od@@ ell : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
the Venus was once more hab@@ itable according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorith@@ ms that resem@@ ble those of climate resear@@ ches .
the model was designed to determine whether Venus with their hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once could have been recorded .
scientists have previously indicated that the long rotation of the Venus could be explained through its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ similar atmosphere and slowly over@@ turned .
the model illuminated also the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably pointed out more dry areas than de earth , but had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and weak evap@@ oration .
the early Venus benef@@ ited from a sun , which was a matter of 30 percent .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the long rotation of the Venus reg@@ ained its daily side of the sun almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which seems like a rain screen to sh@@ iel@@ ding the surface of a majority of the sun war@@ ms .
the result is average temperatures that are some degree cooler than that of the earth today .
the model brought a history of Venus that resem@@ bles the evolution , which was suspected of plan@@ etary resear@@ ches .
although they were presumably inhab@@ itable , the Venus was exposed to much heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of 3 billion years .
her oceans evap@@ or@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burned down by ultra@@ violet light .
when her hydro@@ gen departed only a thick atmosphere to carbon dioxide with a dead@@ ly greenhouse effect -- the Venus as we know it today .
the researchers divided the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Award .
Patrick Roy re@@ acts as a coach of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy joined Colorado on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President of Hock@@ ey Operations of Colorado ) and led to a certain discre@@ tion law on the decision of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will soon seek after a new trainer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last three years I have performed my duties as a head coach and Vice President of hockey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and destination , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy met in a position . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have thought in the summer long and much more about how I could improve this team to give it more depth to give it more depth , it needs to bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the Vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President of Hock@@ ey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organization .
he must also have a certain specific decisions made by the team that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are not met .
Sak@@ ic , which was fired on 23 May 2013 , had its contributions to him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; Patrick has informed me today on this decision , &quot; said Sak@@ ic .
we appreciate all that he did for our organisation and wish him for the future only the best .
Roy has received the winner &apos;s best coach in the league during its debut season at the Aval@@ ok@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
he led the association to 112 points and on the first place in Central vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Play@@ offs of Minnesota and missed the final season in each of the two last years .
the Aval@@ ok@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the season 2015 @-@ 16 and fell behind the wild for a second Wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .

Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ öl@@ man take talks on , put away strike
the labour force concerning the re@@ mun@@ eration for Nord@@ se@@ e@@ öl@@ ves are exposed , while all the parties involved a new conversation round at the table , they said negoti@@ ator .
strikes against the Wood @-@ Area Wood Group were spor@@ adi@@ cally carried out by Royal Dutch Shell in the North Sea by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; Wood Group as well as the un@@ ite and r@@ mt unions can confirm that we re@@ united us to start the winding process of the current stre@@ ites , &quot; it is called in a joint statement .
we will keep some full @-@ day meetings in the next few weeks , starting at the beginning of next year to re @-@ start the problems .
the unions told that their last strike , who is the first in over 25 years , a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
in this year , Wood Group has shortened the inst@@ al@@ ments to its contra@@ sts in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s rating agency follows a 10 % drop for on@@ shore contrac@@ tors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts in the company gives the required space to get through the market up@@ swing .
Shell has announced for his part thousands of people and announced plans to leave his oil and gas business operations in up to 10 countries since it uses its business activities as a result of its meg@@ ac@@ us@@ ername with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure because of lower cru@@ de oil prices under pressure , an economic situation that decided to leave the European Union through the decision of the British in June .
the Scottish parliament of Dave Anderson arrived at the beginning of this week with workers to discuss one of the greatest work disp@@ utes which took place in the North Sea since a generation .
the North Sea is important for regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need a economy that works for many , and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected to spend new projects in North Sea by an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Kepler measures rot@@ ational rate of stars in the cluster of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Kepler Wel@@ sh teles@@ cope helped astronom@@ ers to collect the complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the Star Wars of Ple@@ j@@ ades .
the new data will help the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars in the star cluster at different rates , as well as in which connections are standing with the plan@@ etary table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope that we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a dying , his old age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the constellation of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is 445 light@@ years from the earth .
many stars in this constellation , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , is now the adult age .
they are now able to turn right now .
to top rot@@ ational rates , these gri@@ pping @-@ stars ob@@ tains large amounts of star winds .
since these winds have to travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a slow@@ ing effect on the stars .
when a star is aged , its rot@@ ational rate begins to slow down .
Kepler measures the rot@@ ational rate of every star by recogni@@ zes the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ z@@ able star@@ cks -- such as sun@@ shine -- recognize .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that massive stars slower than a less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with a larger star slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes as smaller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ballet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Ple@@ j@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors to be able to be massive , better against faster rot@@ ors to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the star@@ ring of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare positions as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the cluster has an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
it is still much ahead of us how we would like to know more about how , W@@ ann and Why stars are slow down their rot@@ ational rates and so to add their &quot; dancing shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of rot@@ ational rates of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades which will soon be published in the astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversi@@ al bas@@ eball Star ...
the tears ran at Alex Rodri@@ guez more than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base Base .
after its emotional withdrawal announcement , the 41 year old pro will be able to wear on 12 August against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay R@@ ays a last time in his New York Y@@ an@@ ke@@ .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Good@@ b@@ ye &apos; to the &apos; , explained the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star Game Particip@@ ants of Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ guez was elected to the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series .
his signature under a tenth year contract signed him 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
by the end of the contrast on 31 December 2017 , he served as consultants and youth coach - with full salary .
as a player , it paid Rodri@@ guez long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his team ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas rank@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he achieved a couple of mil@@ estones .
with the Hall of Fame members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays are only two additional bas@@ eball player in the most important statistics similar values .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old has not yet to be taken into the open period of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls .
for so successful Rodri@@ guez - the nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - on the field was so controversi@@ al is his appearance outside the place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 the super@@ star in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was launched between 2001 and 2003 in ster@@ oids . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was closed for 211 games due to a settlement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis Sk@@ and@@ al by the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ guez is considered to be the main susp@@ ect for years to have received an anti @-@ aging clinic in Southern Florida .
after a legal dispute , the lock was still reduced to 162 encoun@@ ters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have a favour for the year 2014 , because I played a break for 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even his f@@ arewell days are not dis@@ ap@@ pointing .
during a lot of bas@@ eball le@@ gen@@ ds in their last games , Rodri@@ guez had to sit on the bank .
&quot; my job has no f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win each game , &quot; Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ard@@ i .

Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first d@@ op@@ ing@@ ines
ignor@@ ance : due to a positive di@@ op@@ ing@@ sample , the weigh@@ t@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland cannot start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owing by the first official dos@@ ed cases .
a erotic athl@@ ete could have won almost a medal .
before the seventh race competition , the first official D@@ op@@ ing@@ ines became known for the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese s@@ mer@@ in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre obst@@ acle in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish Ge@@ weigh@@ ting Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested and excluded - immediately before the start of the early @-@ critical athlet@@ ics competitions this news will come to un@@ time .
at Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tics has been proven by hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de , which is used as a ask@@ an agent for d@@ oping sub@@ distances .
on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Tribunal CA@@ S confirmed its expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butterfly , only around 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have to participate in the pre@@ lu@@ ent over 50 m Freestyle .
Ch@@ en has requested the opening of the B @-@ rehear@@ sal at the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) in the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .
the national association take the matter &quot; very serious and demands from Ch@@ en full cooperation with examinations , &quot; cited X@@ in@@ hua from a communication : &quot; we will work with the International Sports Tribunal CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot;
for the first time in history is no longer the IOC , but the CA@@ S responsible for the nom@@ ination of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio passed the news about the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went out into the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my four test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was &quot; an incredible lap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they be innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the athlet@@ ics &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report it is expected to act on the associated substance by the EP@@ O blood d@@ op@@ ing@@ agent EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova was pro@@ vision@@ ally suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B sample also should be positive .
Bulg@@ arians Prime Minister Bo@@ jko Bor@@ is@@ sow fell immediately with criticism of the Ath@@ os to Word .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sports@@ men do not drag the right battles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We are Bulg@@ arians under observation , so many are excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , about all weigh@@ t@@ lif@@ ter from the chronic d@@ op@@ up@@ loaded Nation may not participate in Rio .
on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg , was tested on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on three days earlier .
both surveys , however , are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athletes is particularly the case Dan@@ ek@@ owa another serious blow for the rep@@ utation of the entire sports art .

data cl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ presses h@@ acker her rans@@ om
programmer of refresh@@ ing malware , are currently targeted to target companies - and are successful .
according to a recent survey of malware anti @-@ defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surveyed companies surveyed at least once , partly multiple victims of an attack with Er@@ press@@ er software .
in Germany almost 20 percent of companies have already been the goal of a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware creation .
40 percent of the victims paid will@@ ingly by the perpet@@ rators required by the perpet@@ rators to be able to re@@ use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators specialized its er@@ aser software according to the observ@@ ations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes and to attack in company networks .
if they have successfully been successful , the potential to comp@@ res@@ sive soldering tip is significantly higher than with private use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching an incredible evolution of pollutants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ z@@ yn@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 most Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpet@@ rators discovered the do@@ er software for themselves .
only private use was the goal but the change to corporate att@@ aching took place in the past months in the past months .
R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is working according to a simple pattern : once upon the computer of a sacrifice , they are looking for specific files , such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files , as well as from pictures and videos .
these files encryp@@ ts R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als .
then the software presents the requirements of the comp@@ ress@@ er .
in order to get the final key code to the files , the victims must have money - mostly in form of Cr@@ yp@@ tow@@ ed bit@@ coin .
but where at private use the personal photo database is on the game , it is advis@@ able to companies about sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage falls off when a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware suggests .
22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses by R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware , 13 percent even had to break the business activities completely , in a case there were people in danger .
in Germany , multiple hospitals were already threatened by attacks whose patients can be threatened by the loss of health .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say to the victims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We will not pay , but it promotes only the problem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained K@@ lec@@ z@@ yn@@ ski &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 per cent of companies that are paid , get their data again .
for managers it is difficult to re@@ ject the demand of perpet@@ rators in view of a stand@@ still in operation .
the h@@ acker is again knowing this and try to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the security for@@ scher of F @-@ Secure explo@@ res the commercial surfaces and contact the contact with the press@@ ors : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain their victims by chat as they can pay per bit@@ coin , freely accessible support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t free example files .
and they will be redeemed by individuals according to payments of a few hundred thousand euros , companies must pay part hard negoti@@ ate and five digits sum@@ s to withdraw their data .
in view of the potential high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware creation , the h@@ acker is always professional and share the work , explains security professionals from the Internet provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that it is about three or four people .
the programm@@ ers sell their pollutants then in the form of a software package to the actual comp@@ ress@@ er .
the current malware kits produced by malware , consulting and additional tools for one @-@ time , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delivery includes an adaptation tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comp@@ ress@@ er are then looking for further h@@ acker to spread the fresh@@ ly purchased software under the victims .
we live in a service sector .
thus , in one of the for@@ ums in the bottom , the set of a det@@ ective , bought the set of a det@@ ective and commissioned to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is made per in@@ adjusted computer .
&quot; usually , the crimin@@ als then bear sp@@ ammer with spreading , explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the risk of R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is now known for many companies that ensure their data .
more than 50 percent of companies IT leaders in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes @-@ survey trust in R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware by using file @-@ Back @-@ ups and Sc@@ ann@@ er@@ Software .
according to the perpet@@ rators , the perpet@@ rators have already been pursu@@ ing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone does not have sufficient thre@@ ats for successful revival , the perpet@@ rators are declared with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ z@@ yn@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means the claim potential depending on the type of data yet to be a multiple higher than before .
the perpet@@ rators could also take completely new targets on the internet of things in future .
on the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con demonstrate security research as they were able to get a thermo@@ stat under their control .
in the middle of winter , the activation of a der@@ art block could be well worth a rans@@ om .
when the perpet@@ rators will block a whole production line instead of the heating in the future , R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware might also be a theme in the Industry 4.0 .

Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday life
in the small HR V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little cou@@ pe and even the versat@@ ility of a mini@@ v@@ ans .
sounds pretty re@@ load , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new Jazz , actually shows in everyday life as a deci@@ de@@ dly flexible .
although only 1,@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V rather small , the passengers have both in the first row as well as in the rear , there is no spot close to any spot .
the materials of the interior space are well processed and can work enjoyable , only the cockpit @-@ top falls there .
versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V for the storage room .
it is not only a car boot from 453 l at high rated and 10@@ 26 l when folded back are available , but there is the Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
this is less lean , as it sounds : the seat surface of the back bench can be set up like Kin@@ os@@ essel and offer a storage room that is height of the floor up to the ceiling is 1.@@ 24 m high .
the boot space can be loaded well , but the loading height is 650 mm somewhat higher than comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
however , he is likely to teach his job a little qui@@ eter .
the everyday consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another car : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behaviour is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort .
but the steering is likely to be a direct direct .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the collapse sometimes sometimes , because it has been rated as &quot; her@@ ann@@ ah@@ ende &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very reliable works of the remote control assistant .
and the intelligent speed regul@@ ators respon@@ ds to traffic detection and thr@@ ott@@ le when needed .
however , the full connectivity is available only for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touchscreen , Nav@@ i , app integration and more .
two USB@@ - and a HDMI jack are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore something to achieve a thing .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
if you don &apos;t want to invest in so much , the petrol engine will receive from 20,000 euros , the diesel starting from 23@@ 000 Euro .
the motors comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
Airline does not require : fall to passenger cars
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .

better traffic flow on the motorway exit
a painting occurred regularly on the re@@ side street - here a picture of November .
but that should change : the legal ab@@ b@@ ur should be extended .
this is a good news for all car sk@@ iers , which stand in professional traffic on the ambient road every evening in St@@ au , when it reached via the Highway ( Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the road construction industry extends to the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16th / 17th August ) in the area between the Hammer street and the exit of Wes@@ ley Street , the legal train station is by 700 metres .
drivers can then turn right from the Hammer street right .
the great advantage : the traffic divi@@ des itself early , thereby reducing the total schedule on the most popular section of the federal highway 51 .
the idea of the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the tram stop on the Zu@@ br@@ inger nerv@@ t the drivers above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days the back @-@ stone dates back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ ping route , and sometimes also beyond .
reason is the needle &apos;s eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit of Wes@@ eler Straße .
from here , traffic will only be guided via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be back in front of a three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations have shown that the bridge does not have the required capacity to record the heavy duty traffic in particular .
as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated stro@@ kes , the competent authority may not say .
however , to calculate with years : for the bridge has an official balance period of up to 20@@ 34 .
the state operation has been aware of the right @-@ weaker period in school holidays , because with disabilities .
traffic will be passed on Tuesday and Wednesday on Wednesday at the building site .

relaxing night : tips against sleep disorders
in the evening , they are getting around for ever , at night , one is awake for hours , in the morning there is no more to think about sleep .
that is all other than relaxing .
after all , one is with such problems in good society : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces and more than ten percent , their sleep frequently or permanently found their sleep .
how do you sleep problems or sleep problems ?
there are several forms of sleep distur@@ b@@ als , and there may be varied causes of causes , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ ß , the board member of the German Society of sleep and sleep medicine .
what we under@@ stand@@ ably under@@ stands , but the in@@ som@@ nie , so is an input and bo@@ oting .
just that &apos;s going to sleep , many people find as uns@@ at@@ is@@ edi@@ ly or in@@ sufficient , Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , manager at the German Haus@@ er Association , with practice in the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on Var@@ el .
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind it , organic , psych@@ ic or persistent factors can be used , but also medic@@ ations required .
it is not rare is the sleep of a different condition .
&quot; very early wake up is especially with depression frequently , &quot; says We@@ e@@ ß .
and it may be that different factors do ev@@ isions together .
for example , who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can be po@@ or@@ ly lie , w@@ akes every two to three hours and begins to gre@@ e , about all day issues and take to gre@@ et , there is an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
from when should I use sleeping disorders to the doctor ?
those who do not sleep over a month at least three nights per week and imp@@ aired on the day , should go to the doctor .
the impair@@ ment can be completely different : one is sm@@ itten , tired , not clean , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical problems such as stomach or head@@ ache .
in order to reach the sleeping disorder , it is important to find out their causes .
as treatment options , amongst other behavi@@ our@@ al changes , a cogn@@ itive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or also medication - classic sleeping tray only occur in exceptional cases and for two weeks - in@@ quire .
it is hardly available in Germany in Germany . Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , head of the inter@@ disciplinary sleep medical centre of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
therefore one should initially apply with sleeping difficulties initially to the physician , we@@ t we@@ e@@ ß .
he may clari@@ fy whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep laboratory , and what happens ?
for the examination in the sleeping laboratory of physician , for example , in car@@ cases with breathing difficulties if you don &apos;t find the cause of a sleeping disorder in case of trouble or if you do not find the cause of a flow distur@@ b@@ ance .
you do not have to prepare for the examination .
one should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please make a lunch break , &quot; says Fi@@ fty .
after shut@@ down , you go to bed at its normal time .
in addition to the electrodes on the body you have a nose br@@ ille , a chest strap and a f@@ üh@@ ler at the finger .
in addition , a camera stands on the ceiling to the ceiling .
how can people get problems in the handle ?
there are quite a lot of pitches where you can set for a better sleep .
We@@ e@@ ß counts on : regular bed@@ time and rise times , not to sleep in bed , do not sleep on the day , not watching television to sleep , alcohol depart , and at night not at the clock - then you will not begin to calculate , and that &apos;s quite and not eligible to transport .

airport : Ban@@ de of luggage captured
professional Di@@ th@@ iev@@ es at the Airport Düsseldorf
civilian populations of Düssel@@ dor@@ fer Police succeeded on Thursday the arrest of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years .
the facts had committed to hold several pocket and luggage ste@@ els as a ban@@ de .
at 21.@@ 30 o &apos;clock , civil servants realized at the airport Düsseldorf a Ban@@ de again , which was known for polic@@ emen from the past theft .
the two women and two men had already committed several del@@ ik@@ te since the middle of July this year and were very professional , working and particularly professional .
the specialists of the crime committee 34 can re@@ loc@@ ating the di@@ vor@@ s to have traveled to Germany four actions .
in total , they carried a total of more than 15.000 Euro .
Alt@@ built , a couple of lin@@ king baths , in between another head@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain does not work on the first glance , but the police list@@ ened to the &quot; hazardous places &quot; of the city .
if you come along the road from east to west , you come to gam@@ ers , a refresh@@ ed kinder@@ gart@@ ens and a be@@ ol@@ ade over .
someone at the facade of a grey house has &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed .
opposite a Li@@ dl that will soon be demolished , it is already built : until 2017 there will be a house with high windows and 133 new rentals in 2017 .
article about this &quot; trendy district &quot; as the competent estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain , are illustrated in the last weeks , however , preferably with burning cars .
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , the inhabitants have been occupied by now , however , in the ground floor , however , rooms have been occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , the Berlin inside of Germany had several times a hard demonstration of the police against the project , the area as &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
after having been cleared away on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ ie@@ de , with 300 police officers , according to the police , according to 30 to 40 civil servants and three team cars before the site , locked parts of the road , and the visitors were able to enter the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile in the renovated building workers in the order of the unknown house owner the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin administration decided that the clearance had been illegal , and a day later , police and builders refused under the Ju@@ bel of sympath@@ izers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the street peace@@ fully : parents walk with children , people sitting on the brush in front of the houses in the sun , others maintain late late .
in close proximity of the skin projects there are primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
left violence is not the main organ of many people : K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the p@@ ines since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , which attrac@@ ts three children , mainly by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the hood projects they divide the concern in front of the rising and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it sounds not after a p@@ ines , who had the majority of police guard before v@@ and@@ al@@ ding left .
the tr@@ ench , which the Berlin &apos;s inn@@ en@@ ator and the police between house@@ keeper and their neigh@@ bors , does not exist .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working area , which also has a lower average income in comparison to the rest of the city and a low risk of poverty .
also house@@ keeper and the living @-@ born residential projects are already long to the p@@ ines : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including nearly the whole ma@@ z@@ zer road close to the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer had been cleared among large police officers , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ s , some of the projects were inhabited by people who occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the neighborhood has become increasingly on the mag@@ nets for tourists and elec@@ toral liner from all over the world : with them now the residents of GDR @-@ times and former Haus@@ er occupied their p@@ ines .
this is also noticeable in the rentals , which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : they recogni@@ zes them on the stran@@ ded discs or fresh@@ ly coated fac@@ ades , which were cast with paint .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was often mentioned this year so often with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a reason for this that not all neigh@@ bors who are considered the problem might be that they are not affected by the crimin@@ ality , according to criminal off@@ ence , statistics show almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the largest part of the offen@@ ders make atomic damage resulting in the new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , which has been living for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversi@@ al 94 , cannot be any talk of un@@ certainty .
what violence does , it is weigh@@ t@@ ful : people in the 94 are their neigh@@ bors who do not have been this .
also the famous burning cars give it right in the Rig@@ s no longer no longer .
for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal burning point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps to one another , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than what else . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliber@@ ately drawn into the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße .
therefore , it was so important that the people have returned to their streets : from the police , politics and the media , which took place in July all the de@@ ut@@ ory effect on the neighborhood .
but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road is still taken away : by ges@@ i@@ ded new buildings in former construction sp@@ ells that the old inhabitants are twi@@ sted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are the con@@ domin@@ iums which are not interesting for many here - there are rather people who are not so good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction can I not have gu@@ essed . &quot;
but what should I do if any one listen to any one ?
there is also fru@@ stration among all sides fru@@ stration also in the police and the inhabitants .
for migrants who are more than colour@@ ing , K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer little understanding : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the p@@ ines .
who moves , should be aware of its - just like anyone who moving into a cart@@ el quarter , po@@ or@@ ly can compl@@ ain about noise .
all people with pre @-@ names presented are asked to be called , not named with their right names .
Ur@@ bach : An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le is a new refugee officer
An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le is the contact person in the field of integration and organizers .
she is also social worker in front of the spot .
since July An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le has been the refugee officer for Ur@@ bach .
social ped@@ agog@@ ue supports the management of Ach@@ im Gro@@ upe .
it looks as a response to all actors : refugees , labor group assistance , administration , authorities and who else still inter@@ mixed .
RE@@ G@@ INE customer is generally indicates that the honorary citizens are more than@@ k@@ able that Deu@@ ver@@ le is now that Deu@@ ver@@ le is , who has ei@@ ves Woll@@ mil@@ chs@@ au , who has a problem in particular .
so , some - less sp@@ ott@@ le than rather than the multitude of sub@@ mits sub@@ mits - gener@@ t when the administration wanted to write the site .
looking for an administration force with a talent for Languages and people , associated with a long @-@ term experience in the field of social work , just a je@@ ans of pleas@@ ures .
but administrative work is not their central area , An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le .
above all , it is about organization to work with people on site and also behind the scenes as well as networks as well as networks .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for around six weeks .
it has a 50 percent place limited to three years .
&quot; it was the highest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine client , that An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le Ehr@@ lich &apos;s amb@@ ition and government actors supported . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are great and small problems , organiz@@ ational , human and understanding problems .
soon new containers are standing in the basin
a serious problem has been recognized since some time , apartments for the connecting camera to have been recognized .
the commun@@ es are responsible for the connection of the connection .
you need to accommodate refugees in their own or rented rooms .
the costs for the construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the Govern@@ or to the Commune and job centre .
problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer its apartment .
the search have been designed for a very difficult time since some time .
de fac@@ to find the administration of no private apartments .
so far , it was not working yet , you have been instructed to private apartments so Deu@@ ver@@ le .
therefore , non @-@ profit homes must be not@@ orious , as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers are placed in the basin .
but only with apartments it is not done .
Per@@ spective is the key@@ word , are Reg@@ ine customer and An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le .
in addition to a permanent lead , there are trainees , training places , school locations , one euro jobs and helpful activities for refugees and migrants who have to be folded or set up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more places would be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine client &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many are working in the building farm or help house @-@ master , do @-@ profit work - and motiv@@ ated and very ti@@ dy , as An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le reports .
it hopes that the work for the community has lead to a positive out@@ action .
that is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but it does not only work .
the day needs a fixed structure , say Deu@@ ver@@ le and customer .
the people have to develop an in@@ ad@@ diction feeling .
so we need offers like sport , contacts with native and especially language courses .
professional courses are ra@@ r .
you also ski@@ p board and honorary citizen here .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome in Germany and welcome .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they must explain the refugees that it takes just and it can make the time a meaning@@ ful bridges , for example with language courses .
whoever knows the feeling that he could help in Ur@@ bach did not work , do not work and be un@@ profitable , who will never integrate himself .
the distinct majority be motiv@@ ated .
problem cases , however , there is also a hon@@ est , &quot; people , in which nothing goes . &quot; the work of Deu@@ ver@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
all these have been a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
a difficult question : have the two after recent inci@@ dents in radic@@ alization , also in a small municipality like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine client really clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what lack of n@@ ai@@ v I may call . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a residual risk could , but would not exclu@@ de them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sen@@ si@@ zing are the hel@@ per yet .
these inci@@ dents were also the topic of the refugees .
they could have fear that the attack should complete her in re@@ vocation .
&quot; they want to show that they do nothing to do , &quot; says Reg@@ ine client . &quot;
many would glad@@ ly stay in Ur@@ bach .
so , main and hon@@ our@@ age must be paid locally and in the region according to activities .
they always have always in the background that soon a new Sto@@ res could come to refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a upper limit ?
this question is clear to answer the policy .
actually it is un@@ fair to place it from place .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not arrived here , where we want , &quot; says An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le .
no new refugees , that would be able to relax .
RE@@ G@@ INE customer also makes clear that the Ur@@ b@@ acher util@@ ized even to integrate the previous human being .
there are currently around 100 people , mainly young men .
but if people are in need , one must help them , both women are lon@@ ely .
the political world situation is so complicated , there is no easy answers .

perhaps the unknown in fact was close to the apartment near the apartment or at their escape .
