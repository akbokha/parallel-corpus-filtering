<seg id="1">Clint and Trumps Economic Policy in Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and prevent trade agreements TTP - they want both Clinton and trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential competitor, however, in the tax and energy policy, as well as in a basic request.</seg>
<seg id="4">Differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton understands a fundamental, more philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to stop the doubt rather small and warns, as the state of the economy harm - with tax and regulation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton would bestow the economy to death and regulate death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, himself would be quite different, claimed to be Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will drive rages massively, and he makes himself strong tax reform with lower tax rates strongly - for individuals and for businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton says: the state has to fulfil certain tasks, he has disadvantageous opportunities and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, the taxes for the rich would be increased, she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Both are very close to the theme infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">To be invested in the must, Trump and Clinton say nearly similar.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic applicants announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are rejected by the state-critical Teachy-wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump, so many internal discussions could come.</seg>
<seg id="17">Significant are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal plants and return the coal promotion in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil extraction is also possible to terminate the climate agreement in Paris in order to terminate the climate agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">In contrast to the investment program, Clinton also aims to strengthen renewable energies and demands: "a country will make the superpower of clean energies and create millions jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will be either China, Germany or America." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only with the infrastructure - even at international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from one another.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the expo-fish trade agreement, do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both the U.S. do not want to isolate the international trade, but simply protect American jobs better.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should then be paid better, urges around Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7,25 US dollars is a hunger strike.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be rinsed, then he says he will not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months is probably not likely to develop the control policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On one side is Trump, who wants to escape the economy and citizens to spur growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics keep him before, that the budget deficit would only be bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who wants to demand at least of the rich wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of outer sides"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and proclaim the official end of the eight months of the war and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish opposite to the gold-gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace in reception, I can not leave me of invasure that Ankara wants to make them reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There were the stroke, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putto the smile worked narrowly and it felt hardly warmth, even for his return conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">On the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, said to his "dear friend" Putin, according to a report about five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but can even improve even better.</seg>
<seg id="10">On the next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have been enlightened, as it would never happen to happen.</seg>
<seg id="11">His enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite to me.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable cooling showed that the Russian president of Russia had not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first, what he mentioned in his introductory remarks: the surplus of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow reaction to the time was wutated.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin told, and accused Ankara to be back in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was even bigger because it was committed by a boyfriend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Vetegs will rebuild again, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months the state-controlled media led a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">It seemed to be at once, when the Turks were able to bear all the guilt.</seg>
<seg id="21">The allegations of senior civil servants have benefited that Erdogans had benefited his own family from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria, which will be controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has fought this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it is time to look back to the front.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse of the President Erdogan who wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind win.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of an armistice is clear by hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs all friends, which he can get after the last month in a failed coup d'etat of almost his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="28">He repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there is also economic motifs.</seg>
<seg id="30">The Russian sanctions went hard on Turkey - particularly the ban of batches, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, travel activities and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late aisles of the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state television set up fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports will be allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemoci formulated this way: "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is wailing on the west, since the reaction of power tried to consider power than weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">Coming to the EU's accession to the EU accession negotiations and Putin, the long-lasting increase in the EU accession negotiations and Putin is to reduce the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the west.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, the Russian State Leader won a bonus that he called for the elected coup d "état for the elected State organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is well-noticed for Moscow a self-understanding, which himself has a deeper fear of regimeaval.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit meeting in this glittering palace of the sea allowed Russia and Turkey, one, as it described to me an analyst, "Alliance of outer side": two countries, which are cast off from the west and poorly treated, and therefore serve.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently delivered the role as a peace block, but where Russia and Turkey support various parties.</seg>
<seg id="44">It might be drawing that after almost three hours of first seminars on the press conference, they said that they didn't attack the theme once.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey forged it deliberately on a question about her differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus in front of where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potentials for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey's Russian fighter jet fuel - it is certainly better to talk about two Heads of State at least.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Russian President Vladimir Putin was unexpected in expectedly his staff of Chief Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanov was part of the narrowest trust of Putin for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed to the special representative for environmental and transport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a position of the Kremlin it is that Putin has ordered the release Ivanovs of his duties as chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who had been on the deputy chairman since 2012, was appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 1972, he was born in Tallinn, and graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the site of Kremlin it is called (in Russian) that he later became a protocol of protocol and head of government agencies.</seg>
<seg id="10">He said to Putin: "thank you for your confidence."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important role of the government to support your activity as head of state law and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov was asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convincing the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step was mysteriously in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time of the narrowest trust Vladimir Putin and works as he was for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men of the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">In a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on TV in television, both men claimed that Chief of Staff went back on their own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the music for the cameras, there are only few of them - especially now, shortly before the legislative elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">Is this the result of a kind of power to combat?</seg>
<seg id="20">This is no one that nobody knows.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who once again praising the potential president to lead the Russian environmental policy - joined the great skepticism once again.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin who are quoted on the site of the Kremlin said Ivanov "It is true that I asked you to trust this very complicated post in early 2012 - one could almost say - and to trust it for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it represents, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration since four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">He was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and it was a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), he was appointed the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">As Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he confided to most confided.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once, Ivanov was accepted that Ivanov could lead to Russia into the second term of office in Russia because there would have been a third mandate of Putin against the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken from another, near allies Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister, before he was elected president in three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="7">The project is expected to be completed by May 2017.</seg>

<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an engineering craftsmanship in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the removal between the viaduct and bridge deck is a heat activity that require extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, almost 79% of the total bridge is at their place and the last section of the deck is today in Rosyth a betongation for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to the bridge.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt after health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating how the world changed.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenager and child for playing no more go outside, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time to spend your free time on screens, has been cited in the last decade of many.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Pokemon Go it is therefore to pick up people from the sofa and to be active.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the beginning, the time on screen was limited to video games and most recently limited to smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it's great to see that technology and activities are not connected to the outside.</seg>
<seg id="7">I clicked on the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters initially created for the video games in the 1990s (later it emerged as a cartoon animation, game cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">As many phenomena of popularity fell the interest in the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries has been moved through the massive demand that overload the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within few days Pokémon Go had more users as Tinyms and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players go back to outside and seek after Pokémons, which are followed with a GPS and once they were once found, "photographed" (on a screenshot on the phone) or "captured".</seg>
<seg id="13">One generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the Wahn and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the USA, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that sets the "average" person every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiff, an app for Apple Watch, which followed 35,000 users, divided the Washington Post recently with that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of people who followed every day 30 minutes, rose from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Go - it looks just the raw data for the auction.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns for health, people want to bring in "" "" to come "" "" to come from the sofa, "" "" and "every day active in exchange ears, because many public messages are bodily boring and come from people who look like." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, sport cannot be evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who do regularly drives sports, reduces its chances to climb on cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of advantages that is too long to carry them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful at Pokémon Go is that people brings people to do something in the open, that it is fun to them.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people close to the hunt for new friends.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are mürric gamble that must always complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone might run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit already had to follow our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to play sport as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose his riz and the use will be recharged with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Due to Pokemons success, there will be more games to unite apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and will help many people in the hunt, active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="12">The American Simone Biles turnetting at the Schwebebalm during the individual campaigns of women during the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American player, which wins a multi-campaign, and a total of the fifth, while they had their reputation to be the best of their generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">It broke out in tears, as their final result was shown and their long journey took place at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success represents them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps who brought her sports to new heights:</seg>

<seg id="17">It was expected to be a final exam in Brazil, a competition that went not so very between Biles and the rest of the athletes, rather, rather, between her and a load oversized expectations.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world outside is a hazardous place but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We talked with Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to move with armed robbers on the distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you get from the front or from behind it will show you this video as you drive for your thieves.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you turn back from behind, then you should turn back as first, so that you can see your attackers and go out of the line, "says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Take the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before you beat him with your free ellbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then beat him with the knee into the lath and turn, while the attackers are crushed out of pain, the weapon from his hands. beat him with the run into the face and move it down while they turn the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">If attackers are near, the technique is similar - move your body from the line, take the weapon and turn it so that the attackers cannot shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Move at the same time the weight on the weapon and beat the attackers on the chest, then turn the weapon from its handle before moving back and turn the weapon on him.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller undermining the immune system and worgereflex of serious testing by taking some of the most dirty and most enchanting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and itautor Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk will lead its way to a bill, a railing at the Piccadilly Circus, a bribes to a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resistance of its immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">In front of the impregnation of each object, it used a luminometer to show and show us what he is going to let.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results in daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought to depressing a train toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, can be completely impulsive, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright said with doctors and medical specialists on the promotion of gut bacteria and its own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately nothing left what he absent, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright has been known to test the resistance of his gut by going through the world, as well as wonderful things as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds to train stations to the flush buttons of toilets, the task presented his immune system definitely under one sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he said: "as a child I was relatively inworried about my health and I put all possible things in my mouth, earth, worms and sludwater."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was justified for his call.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing that he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its prostitches showed a Luminometry number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison, the luminometry number is freshly washed hands less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet which he refused to refresh after their luminometry value of over 4000 units, while fresh washed hands have a little less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterial number in different places such as the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says," "" "it comes to the worst, which I smoked in a toilet near" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing to dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm not anchored here, because it is indoor here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company has approached Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus that contains both Lactobacilli and vitamin C and D to support the support of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we wanted to offer the consumer really something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We led the Crazy Brainstormings led with them that we said, "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">It states that interest in intestinal health is to be a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of just over the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of the intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with documentary film we could provide more information on an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the direction of the film, added: "let me say," I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I had instructed to him as the eky Russian toilet that will be shown in the movie. "</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course, there were things where it was easier to bring them Ian, and others, in which this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad that we have recorded some of these dirty lees on the film. "</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by the year 2015, 84 percent of respondents of respondents were associated with the well-being of stomach and gut and 58 percent said that they must use at least occasionally products, containing lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="3">They understood in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021, the Parliament election will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays, the UK Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">As far as far as far, it doesn't work: summer holidays, heat and land stony ground - the blowing.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals that are convinced of the election campaign are to be on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">The very most holiday, which are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are no locals, so may not choose the countable.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: in the holidays are helper, the posters hang up, flyer, flyer and out at the end of the vote, only labeving.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the election and final day of the International Day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern have to leave once again the election campaign just under the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase when you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it also goes to something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must be feared.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, since 1998, has been the strongest party since 1998, is now clear behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting, as strongly Neuling AfD, cuts and remains the end of coalry-augmented.</seg>
<seg id="14">Celering, 66 years old and since 2008, head of government, makes an almost unobtrusive election campaign, one can see from his grandparents.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the country, spread roses and plauds a little with the people as it was also his legendary vorous predecessor Harald Ringstorff's predecessor.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, sailors get cold feet and are Chancellor Merkel blossom at the blossom of the AfD.</seg>

<seg id="18">The CDU with its peak counter data, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier has already experienced, as it is when you set the right place to fight for the wrong place of election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited twice a German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Merkel's German Bundestag (German Bundestag) in the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was probably the majority of other federal states," accused Vincent Kokert, Secretary-General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern recently in NDR.</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's too bad to listen to the other corner of Germany, Angela Merkel once again.</seg>
<seg id="23">Apart from otherwise, the Nordost CDU remains largely on the usual elections on market sites and shopping malls with umbrellas and air balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">This, so, cocades, plays only a "lower role."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Union also indicated that you have to leave the base in the country that they must insist very strict, to find a wire to the people again.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is like the left, the SPD, the Green Party, hardly available in the wake of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the Council of the CDU elector cocades on his mitre is also self-larvous: "you have to go there where people are weary, Golden weddings, each birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much on the game stands, Sellering has now called its SPD to an especially committed election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In surveys, the S & Ds must last with 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and just under the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the election of 2011 the SPD gained still at 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The greenery, small party with seven per cent in surveys, can only create the jump into the Parliament's Day.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make out of the holiday-need a modern virtue and put their choice of great-share in the Internet.</seg>

<seg id="34">Otherwise, green election fought on track search for local cervants under the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gajek, the Spitzenkandidatin, curvy straight with a houseboat by the mecklenburgische lakes, and it is also beautiful.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: who does not buy sound plates?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle age love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you have to oversowed him under the pseudonym-Alleaksamic male age-age-age, this statement is derived from the current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the most important rediscovery of sound plates do not want to welcome to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the physical objects from physical objects but to Midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently purchased a plate are all foresight according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely Käuble group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also no hordes through hobbyists - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers retain their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoying the time to spend time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would follow a news report on TV, I would follow me the camera, while I keep in the midst of a busy street in Soho, a modest grey suit and wild beast before I steal, my hands hold and something best determinations like: "so let's take a closer look."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of SoHos is slowly on its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the building where an independent seller has been located - there are still a handful of fantastic record shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the camera to switch the camera for the next part, in which I am standing in close proximity to different men in such stores and try to estimate their age and stud through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I am of Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men middle age) into Reckless Records (data number: eight men middle age, a woman, probably around the 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collectors, ask me?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," says he.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">This sound boards, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I am not followed him), dressing the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of its available income: it is now able to buy plates which he could not afford and buy objects, which he sold, when he was young and plea.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy, are out of the late 60s, early 70s, which was appeared when I was 11 or 12. things where I was probably something too young, to buy it" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="20">It is true that those who buy plates are rather strained and gladly spend time alone, and adds: "I do not wear and I am not very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my Laster.</seg>
<seg id="22">Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, believes that many customers who hits the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, it also noted a new wave of people that are influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and have to see their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the conversations which I have led, people usually ended up in 1998 or 1999 of their collection.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers that once sold their records to buy CDs, now sell their CDs to buy their records. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom on trailers of a certain age in a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds into a business like phonica to realize that record business offers a soothing community of equalled content.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to Wez some of the older customers took a contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel themselves overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw the stability of trusted sound covers, of objects that are happier.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the colt of a void or possession of material owners than a kind of comfort," says Wez.</seg>
<seg id="32">That's with me as a collector so and I think it is so with many people so.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to employ intellectual.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social worker!" "" "a staff of a record stack from a record stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of ICM in April 2009 had almost 50% of the people who have purchased a plate over the last month, have not yet heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record players they never use, while 7% of those who buy a plate, do not have a record players.</seg>
<seg id="37">At that time of the news report I would probably look very concerned, while I have a stack of Bossa Nova Compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at the sounds of the Universe (number of data: three men aged men) has noticed an "trophy" of the Revival. "</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone arrived only here and said," "" "I have no record players, but I would like to buy a Radiohead Schallplatte, so that I can ask them to the shelf." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a large percentage, but it definitely passes.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive load, less musicautious.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no record players."</seg>
<seg id="43">That are younger people, not older, which come only slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, dedicated to the sound plates almost a whole floor, has an blower audience, as I go.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenager and women middle age.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Beasts of latest Synthesis and experts-looking pop instead of experimental jazz. it is good to see such a dip in the customer.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them sees strange lonely, but nagating mental traumata are hard to be fixed, if you stand for 30 seconds in addition.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, runs around a few minutes in the business and viewed the variation of the sheets for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It's rather a shovary hackmel than a big buy-out.</seg>
<seg id="50">They do not earns much, therefore the collection of plates do not have real option, says it.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to one computer or other way, but the beauty of plates is... it drives with a sweet sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it is really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a store that is said that a new generation of record lovers will inspire: Urban Outjam "</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the ticket that jeans-Hotpants, I observe a group of young teenager, who grouped for a moment by Polaroid cameras, before a father and his daughter is superior to buy a Crosley record Player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody looks on it - perhaps because they are only pure decoratively, some so far above that it is impossible to handle them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "panel art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that each attraction for these objects represent more money for the industry and some customers could mean in the depths of SoHos for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money as others, even the one that is most for luxury objects like plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my research shows that the results of YouGoals, it is, at least in record shops in Soho, the great number of female collectors and record lovers that exist in reality, record shops and online.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard in school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with safety not with the stroll through record business of the Berwick Street and the leaves, while holding the starred view of an unsecret, 30-year-old Moderator of meiosis, that affects the shoulders of middle age.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer of the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, in which thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">With a trial negotiating this week, the authorities argued in Calais that the state should be authorised to sell 72 provisorical shops, in which persons sell by cigarettes to Energywall, sell, hairdresser, or tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais prefecture argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy, which would not be paid out of non-tax profit and sanction risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups divided the court that businesses and restaurants are important since the free meals that are offered by the nationally supported association and other groups are not enough food for growing numbers in the warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="6">They led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 provisory businesses, but dreamed that the concerns of the Prefecture of Calais "was absolutely retrofitting."</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge Jean-François Molla said that the grocery stores, cafes and restaurants will play a lot of larger role than merely to feed people who live in extremely prevalent conditions. "</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas of quiet meeting between refugees and volunteers offer.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by the remorsel was the jungle book kids' café of the camp, which is a non-profit and 200 meals a day, English and French classes and an advice about asylum procedures for the hundreds of personal needy, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to maintain the kids' café.</seg>
<seg id="12">In a letter to the Guardian, it was that the closure of "for these children were a catastrophe, of which the youngest eight years old are."</seg>
<seg id="13">The two auxiliary organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge of Migrants has risen to over 9,000 people in the jungle-bearing living - the highest number until now - according to a steep increase of new jobs in the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive power of Britain at the 7-er Rugby arrived in the final on Thursday evening to a abrupt stop at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were defeated with a result of 43-7 in the Deodoro Stadium in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji split a master class in the handling, Side Stepping, Return, line, and roaring power to win gold - their first Olympiamedaille each color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was sunk by the silver medal of the silver medal - Great Britain on that day - and they could definitely be quite proud in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals at the same day could fall back in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But many of them would have been defeated a 15-man team in the form of this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB, but it is probably not - that at least one Brite will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult track behind itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago she lost under Ryan every game with Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">They just lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This canopy is weary but the progress is astonishing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began wonderful and caused the attacks of GBS from Spass.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt the captain Tom Mitchell and Co., when one would run in driving buses. the World Series winner went up 5-0 to top, than Osea Kolinisau at the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With even four minutes of playing Jerry Tuwai, Jerry Tuwai still added a further attack from the right corner, which he walked.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly got the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A hackle Tackle of Mitchell stops the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa to achieve a third goal, but Fiji only stopped.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua in the right corner a touch down and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>

<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou prefished by a weak tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion completed a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's so, as Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB are still going to be in.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is too.</seg>
<seg id="23">The UK introduced basic changes to half-time and completed the fijian gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time, until Joshua Tuisova ran into a Brilliant intermediate play by Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game ran long in favor of the south seabians, whose fans sang, flags pivoted and dancing at the Tribune.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning through fight with the cancer of the trainer for rowing victory</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no emotional gold than with these games, and that wants to be hot.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first strobe up to the last, 220 hard hieve in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in her golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though there were only the Beige, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the Trainers Robin Williams, was present at the second Olympian in a row, the first women in the history of British Sports, which laid down such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, after all her 39.ter unwanted application, which is also exemplary.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant Athletes, which reflects the surface with the elegance of goers, reflecting not the kind of triumphs to geese.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in rudes, a battalion to consent to the incremental progress, which make the difference, and there was nobody known as the trainer, who didn't know this day when he was diagnosed with cancer at all.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, the operable is and they did it.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do that, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a rather bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could start at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, could start what the interruption was at a minimum, if this is the right term in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, therefore I had to go better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran on the station about 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it starts.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rowing is already a challenge, but this makes it even larger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the infirmity of the Victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nervous morning to talk something more than else, and thus tried to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning who was as centurion at the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, "I was a emotional wreck this week. that's perhaps something extremely, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It is repeated, how much me that means, how much I and Helen and also have been working too.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we had no one, therefore, is a massive thanks to him. he is the best coach in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I would have no better person to trainer or wish to wish a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have no race lost in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The pair had a hard rhythm with whom their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close, Stanning and Glover had a lot in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "lead in the process, lead in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to rip off.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not going to make something fine.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted no fireworks today, we wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race what we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The pair will take a break for a year before making decisions on his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover has to appear next week on a wedding, their own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now they just want to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that my last race was.</seg>
<seg id="38">This would have too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London it took about six months to realize that I am a Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new for me and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Here it took about four minutes.</seg>
<seg id="42">That feels like much better, "she said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, Spirit, health: singing senior citizens well</seg>
<seg id="2">The singing has been accompanied by her life: the young woman she was a young girl in school, teaching music, and today she sings the 78-year-old in a senior chorus.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing me - emotional and physical," describes them.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal it feels balanced, cheerful and altogether living, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the moment they do something good with their health and spirit.</seg>
<seg id="6">For singing out of several perspectives a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler from the German senior league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most senior citizens singing in chorus and sharing the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through the regular collage, seniors and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures are frequent in age, a chorus is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience has also done Ursel Kipp in her chorus: "to arrange themselves and to organise themselves to the others - a chorus is a very special form of the compositions."</seg>
<seg id="11">Sing to sing in the positive sense, Hackler is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="12">Because there is a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly calls his lungs are not so fast in everyday life out of the purest.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if it comes to obtain the sound of the voice in the age, Singen is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">On older people, Singen is often a very special effect, Ursula Lenz says of the German labour community of the senior organizations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, the common ropingen had a much higher job, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure, explains them.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz commonly observed that the singing or listening of songs in elderly people are many memories, often connected with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">By song lyrics and especially melodies of self-demenstructed people in long back events.</seg>
<seg id="19">At Singen, the head becomes a special power, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time to concentrate on its own voice and on a pre-given rhythm and to adapt the other things - this is a huge cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just older people who live alone, do not have to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one drives through the singing in the chorus, the Hackler is driving.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem grows through the singing in chorus.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show itself: if I have long for something, I will better and watch over me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start with singing, so there's enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Anyone who wants to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he believes, little talent.</seg>
<seg id="28">One sings not alone - at 50 singly people who listens to it if a sound goes beside it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the suitable offer there are seniors different possibilities, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If anyone sings from the acquaintance in a veteran age, you can simply connect.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views of the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">He who wants to sing in a church choir can turn right in the church or church leaders.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior members can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask friends or neighbors to help help at the website.</seg>
<seg id="35">Everyone who desire to sing is to connect to a choir, abt Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing the soul good and has something strange - that is valid for every age.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after they had shot three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockeyteam of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said they could not remember that ever did.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't include the people who keep your gates in memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, they know that: the Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are the same in their group with the British in the first place that remains undefeated after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Great Britain and the United States will join the first round of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams are already qualified for the quarter-final, the game will decide which the two teams will get in the first and second place within their group of six teams.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first place will take a little longer a bit longer from the track that the other group will run.</seg>
<seg id="10">Just like the game on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising turbel by their success story, four years after they landed in the past London Games on the last of 12.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years of a hockey jigsaw in their hands (their two older sisters played the sports at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became a player in the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">You missed the Olympics in 2008 because it was not able to qualify for the header.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, where she and her team went all.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the subsequent year Craig Parnham was an Englishman, coach of the Nationalteams and thus began to turn the things for better.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "a change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," "" "said Bam." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">We didn't had the work progress in London that we have now.</seg>
<seg id="18">We'll be able to pluck the ruder completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening, Bam opened the doorstep in the first half of the game with a return surcharge from the suture area.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had gone to the game without victory in the tournament, but the team showed surprisingly tough and held the game stand from 1-0 to the third quarter, until the game took into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">They made a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the ball in the middle and brought the ball to the Americans to create a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the doorkeepers of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who so far had to book a gate in each of the previous games.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amidst the Rage of the Olympic Games, Zen the trampolins</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are too late, the Olympic Games are too late.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel durable and insoftened, a rapid relay between competition and streches.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is, when the Olympic torch itself would be a burning staff, which is sufficient by wristbands to the swimmers to the triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can not turn to the television, read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbours in the waiting area, without talking about Simone Biles, Katie Lecovery or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there are Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games, and a women's black with dimples, would definitely be sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-being-being-TV advertising when it would be a swimmers, Turner or even Freal.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fought in the Olympic trampolines around gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports, which are not generally accepted: air pistol shooting, Archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breastfeeding and may reign it long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I would like to make arguments for my particular lovers, then let me turn attention to the discreet charm of the tramp.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampolines have already been a Olympic event since 2000, when it had been in Sydney, it was the last 16 years so many that I asked, did not know that there is an Olympic Port.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional Ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to competition, it has never won a medal in the trampolines and made a athlete until 2012.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to divide the prices for men and the Chinese and the Canadian.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennon from Canada will defend their gold medal in London.</seg>
<seg id="18">The tramp jump has a certain outer lateral leaf, partly because it sounds for the unexplained ear for a Clownsschule than those who sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am no expert, but only a few enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristical potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never-to-wollen salids - but also the grazie of turnaround and diving, the two sports, which combines it essentially.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, what so much means" "" "jumping board" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Battle jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need to shoot a number of falling movements (turning, heals and saltos) before it landing on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They will be evaluated according to official Olympiads, after execution, difficulty level and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic Vektor is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallion must continue in their streches after gold, faster, upwards and above, sometimes up to the target, sometimes go back and back, downwards and downwards at the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They are not only chase the Ziellinie or the starting grid, but also in the television transfer a further cavity: the world or the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="28">The targeted route is Nobel, admired value, even fanatic and it's enough to stir even an audience of tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I'm too tired when watching these games as something tired.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breathing cause.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampolines is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or her prentiful, seemingly heavy like a astronaut, go down to the top, then effortlessly back to the top.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also here is a competition, of course not without difficulty but during practice there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolves in the distance, only the dreaming, elegant angle of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">Qualifying and end of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in the streaming of 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will leave the Endron as part of a afternoon block from 14.00 on both days.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of the Olympia Manie, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one who probably will probably oversee in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the awareness of consciousness can only be achieved through the attacking and the objection male athletes can be reached - like it was the male U.S. Turner at the The Wall Street Journal, - then Mr. Dooley expects to move to air round, new fans.</seg>

<seg id="3">Demonstrators, who demand political changes in Ethiopia, looking for violent resistance of the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that only protesters were killed during clashes with the police at Schussing.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just to break together?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid state of West Germany with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last months, protests against the government went up against the government and spread themselves more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week, thousands of people stormed into the streets and the fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations the answer of the government was innocent.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen were killed on only unarmed demonstrators and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the movement, videos about the protests, probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security experts propose young people with ststicks while these were forced to make a hand stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Chief of the UN Authority for Human Rights demands a temporary examination now.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it was always difficult to hold this land and the future becomes even more difficult," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is estimated that in Nigeria the most populated country of Africa and its stability is estimated at the west.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services work closely with Ethiopians, in order to fight terror over the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expanded in considerable speed.</seg>
<seg id="17">His infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new Pendlersuit in the capital of Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia all other than a model for democracy, human rights organisations have continued to continue the repression of the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, whereby dissidents were effective for silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or in prison, or put into the desert of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and do not have any other options except protesting, it breaks out," said Seym Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopian.</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth are protesting.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation was protestant.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the floor usage to the digging handle in relation to power of the regression of the coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a far-reaching election last year, the regering party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and control 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, the voltages along the border to Eritrea. a fight for these zag, controversial line asked hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analyst fear the separatists, such as the Oromo Liberation Front, or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which were produced over the last years more or less, the turbulences could be explored and to be armed.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of provocation after years of age explode in the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: Smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in the last few years, many Ethiopian was able to communicate using the social media, since cheaper smartphones have been increasingly more common and improved their Internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government obsoles the access to Facebook and Twitter, especially in regular intervals, so many people can still communicate on the internet proxies that they hide themselves.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopian believed that they assembled themselves together to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Orosei and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Orosei and Amharas are not a natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since its prospective, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia, mainly Christian High countries, in politics and the economy, while the Orosei has exploited from which many Muslims are living and in Flachland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this changes too.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are going to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Orosei.</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests were held in the areas of Amhara and Orosei.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Orosei have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which accounts for around 6 percent of the population, and which are dominant in the military, in the trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the rest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former vine leader, was up until his death in an unsealed disease in the year 2012 17 years of Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="43">He has been viewed as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly compensated in it, early signs of unsatisfying and special officers to use opponents and do them undamaging them.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the present regime is missing in this fundamentalist" "", "said Mr. Abdi, Conflicitor," "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopians: new prime minister, Hailemarion Desalegn, was chosen for relatively unclear reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Other than Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Arabia, Mr. Hailemariah comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyst say that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services that is controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia had experienced such an uproar in 2005, after thousands of elections were protesting by the government, underlying and stolen from the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following Razzien, many protesters were killed, even if it was less than in the last months and this time of the rest went relatively fast.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, as well as the new Pendlersuit, as well as for its measurable progress in poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously, this is not the intenving of the internal abnormality of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And she takes a dangerous ethnical form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month protesting in Gondar, an amharic city, of Tigray guided shops and the hatred towards the Tigray is always available in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analyst say that the protests are the US and other Western allies in an eculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a base for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, even if they had recently closed that she closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want to break his ally in a volatile area.</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," Mr. Abdi, "said, is a very thin hike."</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest eddy is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">More rarely sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland's hair usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after a research on board the Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was born in 1624 and swim with a fine of 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönlandhaie got up only with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Greenland harbour at the bottom of the North Atlantic ocean, in an hour it comes to an average just 1,220 meters.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes to pass, the five metre long animal accelerates to a massive 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a Robbe.</seg>
<seg id="9">But that of loneliness, lifestyle seems to be a sponsoring concept for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the professional journal "Science" in any case from Greenland, who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commented Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock this life span that means for cyclones a world record.</seg>
<seg id="12">Indeed, the evolutionary biologist arguably that Greenland is stewed.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lack the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland's sharks are difficult to observe and finally, in the ice sea, they live mainly in the Eismeer, in front of the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they dive in the surface usually only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers have to know about the lifestyle of Greenland.</seg>
<seg id="17">You would like to have a time of time, they found six animals with one transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another one had seized the orbone of a young iron ore.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they hunt them sleeping animals or patrol on the reason of the ice-mear and seek cadaver, which swings from higher water layers to bottom swings.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Grönlandhaie, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard in front of Greenland's depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502-centimeter is measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the Linsencore of Haie with carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is formed already before the birth of Haie, which the proteins are not renewed later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a lot of carbon-14 in the lentil core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, as nuclear weapons testing major quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">At 220 centimeters long, the lentil core contained a low surplus in carbon-14 from the nuclear weapon, it is likely to have celebrated his 50th birthday in its investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">In their lens core, all larger Greenland Hie had a normal carbon-14 levels, which is formed by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-Clock showed an age of 335 years, while the record-shark was even 392 years old while the record-shark was to be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-females only got aftermatured when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to arrange an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined at 156 years, Grönlandhaie became apparent at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This should also be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live mainly in icy waters, is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even the previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland expedition in which bacon on the neck was a 120-year-old harpoon top, was caught on Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to low temperatures, the organism of the living creatures often runs on Sparkasse.</seg>
<seg id="36">So you mature later - and alers slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals often are often big.</seg>
<seg id="38">The volume is much faster than its surface, including the animal heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than in a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal is so far more dangerous and should focus on it as possible as possible as many descendants as soon as possible." "" "the evoluologist Scheuerlein declares as soon as possible." ""</seg>

<seg id="45">After a truly exceptional representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio had gone down.</seg>
<seg id="46">It played in the background, as the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April amidst in the midst of sex and mobbingers as well as the retirement of sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>

<seg id="10">For a few euros, lovers can buy the tools still online, but they come from the Stone Age of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="11">But 20 years ago the Communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier on the computer fair Cebit in Hanover as a "office in the Westentbag format."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could be broadcast a lot: SMS and e-mails could be sent and receive, also by fax was the Communicator.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even the access to websites was possible by HTML browsers, even though torch slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone was similar to a laptop.</seg>

<seg id="18">The price was quite proud of the price: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 Euro in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could have in August 1996 that the Communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything is different.</seg>
<seg id="22">The smart phones are a success story when not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The mobile phone card of the Finns experienced an unprecedented Desaster, finally sold to Microsoft at Microsoft.</seg>

<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to override, but Heathrow answered each question.</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympic Games Heathrow is for many and not for individual infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">Extension is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion to funny growth and a legacy of skills and jobs to both the airport as well as in the UK.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have created a great team in Heathrow, which has been generating a £11 billion expensive infrastructures program in time and budget, from the T5 - the five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, which was built in the middle of the two frequencies test drive.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they are ready to deliver a third-catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion to private investments.</seg>
<seg id="15">The London Games of 2012 was a great success for GB and I'm confident that the extension of Heathrow will also be one.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was once more habitable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate researches.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether Venus with their hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere once could have been recorded.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the long rotation of the Venus could be explained through its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, erdsimilar atmosphere and slowly overturned.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model illuminated also the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably pointed out more dry areas than de earth, but had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and weak evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus benefited from a sun, which was a matter of 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the long rotation of the Venus regained its daily side of the sun almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which seems like a rain screen to shielding the surface of a majority of the sun warms.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degree cooler than that of the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought a history of Venus that resembles the evolution, which was suspected of planetary researches.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although they were presumably inhabitable, the Venus was exposed to much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of 3 billion years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Her oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned down by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">When her hydrogen departed only a thick atmosphere to carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus as we know it today.</seg>

<seg id="12">Ransomware is working according to a simple pattern: once upon the computer of a sacrifice, they are looking for specific files, such as Word-, Excel- or database files, as well as from pictures and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts Ransomware and deletes the originals.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the software presents the requirements of the compresser.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the final key code to the files, the victims must have money - mostly in form of Cryptowed bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where at private use the personal photo database is on the game, it is advisable to companies about sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage falls off when a Ransomware suggests.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses by Ransomware, 13 percent even had to break the business activities completely, in a case there were people in danger.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, multiple hospitals were already threatened by attacks whose patients can be threatened by the loss of health.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we say to the victims" "" "We will not pay, but it promotes only the problem" "" "explained Kleczynski" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 per cent of companies that are paid, get their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the demand of perpetrators in view of a standstill in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hacker is again knowing this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the security forscher of F-Secure explores the commercial surfaces and contact the contact with the pressors: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims by chat as they can pay per bitcoin, freely accessible support websites or decrypt free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And they will be redeemed by individuals according to payments of a few hundred thousand euros, companies must pay part hard negotiate and five digits sums to withdraw their data.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potential high and relatively risky profits from the Ransomware creation, the hacker is always professional and share the work, explains security professionals from the Internet provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a Ransomware about within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that it is about three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their pollutants then in the form of a software package to the actual compresser.</seg>
<seg id="30">The current malware kits produced by malware, consulting and additional tools for one-time, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "delivery includes an adaptation tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," "" "Wisniewski" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">The compresser are then looking for further hacker to spread the freshly purchased software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">Thus, in one of the forums in the bottom, the set of a detective, bought the set of a detective and commissioned to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per inadjusted computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually, the criminals then bear spammer with spreading, explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known for many companies that ensure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of companies IT leaders in the Malwarebytes-survey trust in Ransomware by using file-Back-ups and ScannerSoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">According to the perpetrators, the perpetrators have already been pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone does not have sufficient threats for successful revival, the perpetrators are declared with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing" "", "explains Malwarebytes-boss Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">This means the claim potential depending on the type of data yet to be a multiple higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">The perpetrators could also take completely new targets on the internet of things in future.</seg>
<seg id="43">On the HackerConference Defcon demonstrate security research as they were able to get a thermostat under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the activation of a derart block could be well worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">When the perpetrators will block a whole production line instead of the heating in the future, Ransomware might also be a theme in the Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="10">The boot space can be loaded well, but the loading height is 650 mm somewhat higher than comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, they are getting around for ever, at night, one is awake for hours, in the morning there is no more to think about sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">That is all other than relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is with such problems in good society: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep disturbances and more than ten percent, their sleep frequently or permanently found their sleep.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do you sleep problems or sleep problems?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disturbals, and there may be varied causes of causes, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeß, the board member of the German Society of sleep and sleep medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What we understandably understands, but the insomnie, so is an input and booting.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just that's going to sleep, many people find as unsatisedily or insufficient, Jens Wagenknecht, manager at the German Hauser Association, with practice in the Lower-Saxon Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it, organic, psychic or persistent factors can be used, but also medications required.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is not rare is the sleep of a different condition.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early wake up is especially with depression frequently," says Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it may be that different factors do evisions together.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, who has a herniated disc, can be poorly lie, wakes every two to three hours and begins to gree, about all day issues and take to greet, there is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">From when should I use sleeping disorders to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep over a month at least three nights per week and impaired on the day, should go to the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can be completely different: one is smitten, tired, not clean, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical problems such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to reach the sleeping disorder, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As treatment options, amongst other behavioural changes, a cognitive behavioural therapy or also medication - classic sleeping tray only occur in exceptional cases and for two weeks - inquire.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is hardly available in Germany in Germany. Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical centre of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore one should initially apply with sleeping difficulties initially to the physician, wet weeß.</seg>
<seg id="24">He may clarify whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep laboratory, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For the examination in the sleeping laboratory of physician, for example, in carcases with breathing difficulties if you don't find the cause of a sleeping disorder in case of trouble or if you do not find the cause of a flow disturbance.</seg>
<seg id="27">You do not have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">One should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please make a lunch break," says Fifty.</seg>
<seg id="30">After shutdown, you go to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes on the body you have a nose brille, a chest strap and a fühler at the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera stands on the ceiling to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can people get problems in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of pitches where you can set for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weeß counts on: regular bedtime and rise times, not to sleep in bed, do not sleep on the day, not watching television to sleep, alcohol depart, and at night not at the clock - then you will not begin to calculate, and that's quite and not eligible to transport.</seg>

<seg id="25">The largest part of the offenders make atomic damage resulting in the new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, which has been living for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94, cannot be any talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">What violence does, it is weightful: people in the 94 are their neighbors who do not have been this.</seg>
<seg id="28">Also the famous burning cars give it right in the Rigs no longer no longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal burning point, on the contrary: "here one helps to one another, lives together on the street and gets more from each other than what else."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the Rigaer Straße.</seg>
<seg id="31">Therefore, it was so important that the people have returned to their streets: from the police, politics and the media, which took place in July all the deutory effect on the neighborhood.</seg>

<seg id="5">Social pedagogue supports the management of Achim Groupe.</seg>
<seg id="6">It looks as a response to all actors: refugees, labor group assistance, administration, authorities and who else still intermixed.</seg>
<seg id="7">REGINE customer is generally indicates that the honorary citizens are more thankable that Deuverle is now that Deuverle is, who has eives Wollmilchsau, who has a problem in particular.</seg>
<seg id="8">So, some - less spottle than rather than the multitude of submits submits - genert when the administration wanted to write the site.</seg>
<seg id="9">Looking for an administration force with a talent for Languages and people, associated with a long-term experience in the field of social work, just a jeans of pleasures.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not their central area, Annika Deuverle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organization to work with people on site and also behind the scenes as well as networks as well as networks.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent place limited to three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was the highest time," "" "" "" "says Regine client, that Annika Deuverle Ehrlich's ambition and government actors supported." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are great and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers are standing in the basin</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been recognized since some time, apartments for the connecting camera to have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The communes are responsible for the connection of the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">You need to accommodate refugees in their own or rented rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Governor to the Commune and job centre.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer its apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search have been designed for a very difficult time since some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto find the administration of no private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it was not working yet, you have been instructed to private apartments so Deuverle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, non-profit homes must be notorious, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are placed in the basin.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, are Regine customer and Annika Deuverle.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent lead, there are trainees, training places, school locations, one euro jobs and helpful activities for refugees and migrants who have to be folded or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "more places would be good," "" "Regine client" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Many are working in the building farm or help house-master, do-profit work - and motivated and very tidy, as Annika Deuverle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that the work for the community has lead to a positive outaction.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But it does not only work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a fixed structure, say Deuverle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">The people have to develop an inaddiction feeling.</seg>
<seg id="38">So we need offers like sport, contacts with native and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">You also skip board and honorary citizen here.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome in Germany and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They must explain the refugees that it takes just and it can make the time a meaningful bridges, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Whoever knows the feeling that he could help in Urbach did not work, do not work and be unprofitable, who will never integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The distinct majority be motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">Problem cases, however, there is also a honest, "people, in which nothing goes." the work of Deuverle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All these have been a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: have the two after recent incidents in radicalization, also in a small municipality like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine client really clearly," "" "what lack of naiv I may call." "" "a residual risk could, but would not exclude them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensizing are the helper yet.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents were also the topic of the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They could have fear that the attack should complete her in revocation.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they do nothing to do," says Regine client. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would gladly stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So, main and honourage must be paid locally and in the region according to activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have always in the background that soon a new Stores could come to refugees and migrants to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question is clear to answer the policy.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to place it from place.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we have not arrived here, where we want," says Annika Deuverle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">REGINE customer also makes clear that the Urbacher utilized even to integrate the previous human being.</seg>
<seg id="63">There are currently around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if people are in need, one must help them, both women are lonely.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there is no easy answers.</seg>
