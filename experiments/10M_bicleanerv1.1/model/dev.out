but at the meeting it is supposed to go around the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ States solution .

in a emergency call , Professor , his gir@@ l@@ friend must be shot
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon wo@@ ke with a little fur@@ y voice of the police that he shot his gir@@ l@@ friend and that the officers would have to come to his house .
he was important to emphas@@ ize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still alive and probably excited ; and he said , the family contacts of dead woman could be found on the phone .
within the house the officials increased from A@@ my Pr@@ un@@ iss and a handwritten note , which was critic@@ ized on one white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I loved A@@ my and she &apos;s the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was done according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed from Lamb .
there was no notice that Lamb who had travelled in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , taught 300 miles to the school premises where he went to the grounds of a popular culture professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office and killed .
Delta State University Poli@@ cia Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that the staff members have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 AM .
he said that I had left the fat@@ eful note sometime afterwards .
until the end of the day there was a further death : he took the life as the police cl@@ am@@ elled him .
one day after the shooting gallery in the university , students and do@@ z@@ ers forced to hide free behind doors , the authorities whilst still trying to pro@@ cure a picture of it , Lamb is motiv@@ ated .
the details published by the investigations involved in the two ends of the State details , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped him to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers .
students reported that they were looking forward to his teaching .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er died , where Pr@@ un@@ iss died , he did not have a history of violence or a criminal preliminary story .
he wrote in a book written from him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with which he divided his academic life .
both in the department of social sciences and history , whose teachers comprises 17 members , and many students visited course of both .
at the same time there were some in@@ clin@@ ations too problem@@ atic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Bran@@ don be@@ avers , who praised , said he seemed to be a bit excited and nerv@@ ous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , told him that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
before , the del@@ ta State University had asked for a reason to listen to health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year , he taught only two online courses .
the latest changes in the employment policy of the University estimated that the promotion had worked for the Lamb for something hard , had no guarantee for an automatic way to become a Assistant Professor at a Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt ; but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that can no answer any more .
after the run out of the Campus police , the police later found Lam@@ bs track when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi in Ar@@ kan@@ sas .
before he was arrested , put from a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol at the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &quot; house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Washington County , Cor@@ oner Jack , said .
his car ran still in the entry .
it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
it took place in 2009 at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city of around 12,000 inhabitants , taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he graduated in education in Spring .
one of the long @-@ standing friends lam@@ bs received him intelligent , char@@ ism@@ atic and fun .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said , she was 15 and he was 20 when they met with shared friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to have the guitar player .
he was at the time of the Du@@ b of Germany .
all the girls , when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson city of Bran@@ don .
Lamb and Pr@@ un@@ ks were obviously some time together .
in the emergency call , &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no document of a marriage .
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the baking stone house which ad@@ joining a Ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er ad@@ joining .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the former husband of Pr@@ un@@ iss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said that they were di@@ vor@@ ced 15 years ago but friends stayed and had one daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; she was completely destroyed in the ground , &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en spoke about his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said that he had never met , but because of his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that he was interested in music and play blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ un@@ iss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail compet@@ ed both on a summer @-@ mill@@ ennium before three years ago .
later they played one or another gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter writes and s@@ ings their own music .
Pr@@ er@@ iss was a nurse designed for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ keeper and sometimes animation coordinator at The Jul@@ ep Room , a faint illuminated bar close to G@@ auti@@ er , said that he had to Lamb and Pr@@ iss Night at night 5 . September for the last time after Lamb of his guitar and mouth harp ended in front of a severe audience .
there was no evidence that something did not agree .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were here when we tried and found them .
I mean , they both had a good sense of j@@ est@@ ing .
Schmidt , the t@@ ote professor , managed the first semester of seminar and specialized in American nati@@ ves and colonial history , Don Allan Mitchell , a English @-@ professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Em@@ por@@ ia State University in Kansas and was president of his Brotherhood and the university committee .

8 conf@@ uses that Donald Tr@@ ump should take seriously .
some have tried to burn him as a flop .
others have taken him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a breakdown .
but no matter how some rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to move Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ais@@ les from poll@@ s down@@ wards , it did not work .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the od@@ ds of the nom@@ ination of the property @-@ Mog@@ ul@@ s .
of course , it is too early in the elec@@ toral term .
nobody claimed that Tr@@ ump probably will win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphas@@ ize that Rick Per@@ r@@ ys were in charge of the adv@@ ent Herman Cain , one of which won only one state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have strug@@ gling in a general election .
but outside troops like J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super P@@ AC and the conservative Economic Group Club for Growth will now acknow@@ ledge Tr@@ um@@ ps stamina and start to pl@@ unge their dollars to t@@ opp@@ le it .
here are some actual changes values that indicate that the property Mog@@ ul is not only a temporary phase :
Tr@@ um@@ ps Pop@@ ular values can be rotated by 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candidate in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten Rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate Mog@@ ul .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive opinion of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten predi@@ ct that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures reflect in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa has found last week that 60 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of GO@@ P voters were happy with Tr@@ ump as a candidate .
in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans were either &quot; enthusi@@ ast@@ ically &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tr@@ ump would be nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 would say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; off@@ ended , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he had the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son manages to say about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent ) , they would be &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent , which would say the same about Tr@@ ump .
the next one in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 per cent of Republi@@ can voters say that they are &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; are &quot; off@@ ended &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of the Republi@@ can see Tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ized for his bombs , 52 percent of the Irish voters think that the real estate Mog@@ ul is the right temper@@ ament to a pre@@ sidents , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first country state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he gave the personality to a commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , at least 44 percent , that he did not have the privacy to carry out effectively his term and almost six out of 10 un@@ depend@@ ant that his temper@@ ament does not enter the White House P@@ asse , ABC / post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
if they have insul@@ ted their money , republi@@ can voters stop Tr@@ ump for real terms .
if needed , those who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination will say , after a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C from the last week four out of ten , that Tr@@ ump was the best bet .
this is a change since the time of July 10 , when four out of July you made money back to J@@ eb Bush .
full Dis@@ closure : GO@@ P @-@ voters had not the declared crystal ball in the past .
at that time in the final cycle , four out of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans reported that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination with only 28 % for the final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nonetheless , it shows that a multip@@ lic@@ ity of GO@@ P @-@ elec@@ tors is released as pl@@ au@@ sible .
even when Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered around another candidates , Tr@@ ump suggests almost everyone .
some experts prove that the split field probably contributes to Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership , while the Anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is diff@@ use to more than a dozen of other candidates .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University at the beginning of September shows that a hypo@@ thet@@ ical head @-@ off @-@ head between Tr@@ ump and most other republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump guarantees the majority of majority .
he before Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points lead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before the edge of Paul , John Kas@@ ich and Chris Christ@@ ie 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate that suggests him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the business@@ man with 19 points in a hypo@@ thet@@ ical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a close majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans says that they made their opinion .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only more than half of voters want to support Tr@@ ump , say that they have firmly awarded their voices .
of course , much has to happen to change that and nobody can really say , never change the opinion .
46 per cent said they leave open the door to change to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competition at the moment of the other out@@ side , the neuro@@ sur@@ geon Ben Car@@ son , but voters , who have formed their opinion , are twice as often as Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump during the migration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump has been in his elec@@ toral campaign against including two months of immig@@ rants from Mexico &quot; rape , was the migration of the migration and fishing point in the public dis@@ course of 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ ic expres@@ sions of Tr@@ ump @-@ His@@ p@@ ano Americans will re@@ vo@@ ke from the Republi@@ can party and damaged re@@ orientation efforts .
but on the new ABC / post @-@ survey of Monday , six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump in questions of immig@@ ration .
as long as the Im@@ migration remains at the spotlight , it will also be Donald Tr@@ ump .
the fru@@ stration can be fru@@ stration over the government to meet new high@@ s .
by Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , half of the support of Republi@@ can voters falls above all by their external side status .
six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Monday @-@ survey of ABC / post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience .
and they are also mad in Washington .
a pol@@ l of Des Mo@@ ines register / Bloom@@ berg in I@@ owa in front of two weeks shows that three of four I@@ owa Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have been fru@@ str@@ ated by the Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 per cent &quot; dis@@ satisfied . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential neighbor@@ hoods in Germany
here the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg are the most expensive con@@ domin@@ ium - with a view over the North Sea sheet .
in the street one square meter space costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros on average .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sy@@ lt is limited to objects natural gas &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is the case in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows which special layers co@@ sting a square meter at most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student union in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top accommodation , one is the price but pe@@ an@@ uts .
the Real Estate service provider Engel and Ful@@ ler has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - at Square prices in relatively high levels .
there are several tenth of a thousand Euros - per square meter , well noticed .
but good , who can aff@@ ord it ...
by the way : Munich , it is an exception to the top .
Champions League : Bavaria &apos;s dream choice thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
two @-@ fold sc@@ orer in Pi@@ raeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has simply run a run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller goes to the FC Bayern the way to a comp@@ acted 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ak@@ os pir@@ ate - then ran it .
a sover@@ eign opening of the Champions League @-@ season .
world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze made a dream start in the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; for a dream start to the FC Bayern .
the team of coach P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their performance play in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in a hot atmosphere thanks to the refuse storage double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry it ( 8@@ 9th ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth star in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola wants to get back to the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
in his 28th occasion of the Champions League at the Champions League , for the Bavarian leadership of the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto who made a slope of the World master pass through .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate that , Bayern @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ame had promised U.S. fans in front of the game in Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 fans - and the Munich firm held a word .
they showed a concentrated and dedicated performance , without a shine .
Pi@@ raeus won his youngest six home play in the category category , among them against renowned clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 , Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund was proud here ( 1 : 3 ) .
yet in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up Duel@@ ists with Greek teams were defeated , they didn &apos;t want to be the next victim .
they were cour@@ age@@ ous about , but in their offensive efforts they often have to be too expensive .
the attacks were often for@@ warded as a result of any game trans@@ mitting to Lin@@ ks@@ exter@@ n@@ ally Douglas Costa , who rarely came through the earlier Braun@@ er Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ aou@@ i .
in his right , Müller had more than@@ k@@ ly when its flan@@ k were defeated in the left corner on the left corner .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion made possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half was Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first of all , as the Olympi@@ ak@@ os stor@@ mer ide@@ ye Brown proposed the pol@@ l of the Pol@@ es on the line ( 26 ) .
afterwards , by direct withdrawal , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto with the kne@@ e par@@ ked ( 3@@ 5. ) .
although the Bayern dominated her domin@@ ance game , Pi@@ raeus N@@ adel@@ che could set up .
but it was a por@@ ter Manuel New .
hence , when he shot a shot from ide@@ ye on the lat@@ te de@@ fle@@ ction ( 5@@ 6th ) .
recently , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola introduced a Vier@@ erk@@ raut with David Al@@ aba in the centre of Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after mus@@ cular problems back in the K@@ ader , sat down outside .
the World Cup hero did not give light after the final endurance while Matthias Sam@@ mer said &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who would like to make something different of it , this has already become mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
in the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought the King@@ sley Com@@ an for the hand@@ ler Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) .
Göt@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made another 13 minutes later completely , by El@@ f@@ meter , Müller made a dr@@ auf .
before the game it was come to Kra@@ w@@ alle in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly assumed Bavaria @-@ fans in their audience @-@ block , the tra@@ ilers had prov@@ oked by hosts pir@@ ates with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went with b@@ ang@@ es against the Munich Philharmonic .
at least a Bayern fan was viol@@ ated in the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk to lose teeth
those who smo@@ kes , do not only unge the lung , but also to the teeth - that lays a Potsdam &apos;s long term study .
the good news : when ren@@ unci@@ ation , the risk sin@@ ks quickly .
smo@@ kers have an elevated risk of reducing their teeth early .
this is done out of the long @-@ term study of a international research team , including several employees at the German Institute of Nutrition Research ( DI@@ AG@@ E ) in Potsdam .
in comparison to non @-@ smoking users , the risk of reducing their teeth early , in order to lose 2,@@ 5 to 3.6 times higher than their teeth .
the scientists had observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
main causes for denti@@ als are c@@ aries and infections of the teeth of teeth , st@@ resses the DI@@ f@@ E .
for those par@@ od@@ ont@@ itis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ize the authors .
the connection between smoking and dental loss is therefore return to frequent co@@ g@@ ums in smo@@ kers .
not clari@@ fy that smoking is also increasing the risk of c@@ aries .
people who list@@ ened to smoking by smoking could reduce their risk within a short period of time but write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however it could take over ten years , until the end@@ anger@@ ing again fell to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , first aut@@ or Thomas Dietrich von der English University , Birmingham .
one must convince humans that are smo@@ kers , stated study leaders H@@ einer Boeing of the DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot;
not to smoke is well for lung and vessels and leads to our in@@ sights into a good functional health until the high age .
in Germany , more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years are affected , the DI@@ f@@ E constra@@ ined .
earlier studies already pointed out that smoking will reduce the risk of early g@@ ages .
the new long @-@ term study supp@@ ressing the findings .

EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute over TT@@ IP
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ral system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TT@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the disp@@ uted private protection devices for disp@@ utes between the exhibits and countries should therefore be replaced by a transparent system which corresponds to clearly more traditional dishes .
&quot; we want to establish a system that trust the citizen , &quot; the competent EU Com@@ miss@@ ile Cec@@ ilia Hotel declared in the show .
the Swedish fac@@ ebook planned to bring into the US proposal by a European negoti@@ ating position with the USA .
the German government announced support .
TT@@ IP should be the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
the plans to reform the current Ar@@ bit@@ ration procedure have been assessed by the EU Member States and the United States to select independent judge for a new investment strategy .
the U.S. and third countries are to come from the EU to equal parts of the EU .
another instance is planned for the first time .
it would allow it to be able to charge up the judgments .
until now , the process committed themselves to an arbit@@ rator , a g@@ ay way against their jud@@ gements , did not exist .
in the discussion of the past months , it has become clear that citizens were not familiar with the old IS@@ DS system in Fair@@ ness and justice .
in the long term , they will work according to their own information to an International Investment Court .
there may be any disp@@ utes between Chinese companies and EU countries for example .
the major econom@@ ist of the major investor &apos;s approval procedure ( IS@@ DS ) shall apply as one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe to TT@@ IP .
the traditional Ar@@ bit@@ ral scores are critic@@ ized by opponents as a type of parallel @-@ kin@@ ase , cross the companies fail@@ ures , national laws , or to achieve a reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
in the first opinions , Anti @-@ TT@@ IP organizations involved in the EU Commission &apos;s proposals are in@@ adequate .
the trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) should not be critic@@ ised for the already negoti@@ ated free trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .

since its election Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s has been awa@@ ited for the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister with voltage .
the new Labour leader Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n should give his debut at the Prime Minister for the first time and to give David Cameron &apos;s first time .
M@@ R Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to lunch at the first of its six pre @-@ given questions shortly after lunch , with the performance of the media probably and the Labour Party is approved by the vicinity .
he called &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some sessions to ski@@ p their colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary trial for Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s , because she returns to his appointment as a member of the Sch@@ atten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett and after his speech at the TU@@ C annual conference on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour Party &apos;s decision , on Tuesday , during a commemorative ceremony marking the 7@@ 5th anniversary of Battle of Britain in silence , prov@@ oked the cr@@ iti@@ que of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MP@@ S and is located at the heart of several title pages @-@ Stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s &apos;s decision to sing the national an@@ them , has drawn attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n , he spoke &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ d@@ um of the Royal Air Force in the battle of England &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s Sch@@ atten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night Programme , he have advised the Labour Party to sing the national an@@ them , ir@@ respective of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished .
almost a dozen of shade ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s leading team , and she calls for differences in business , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party he initially supported him as guide .
the BBC Robin Bran@@ t MEP said that political dis@@ agreements are also within Labour &quot; to have Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s &apos;s post@@ ings on the position of the European Union and the limit on powers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour should be set to remove the whole idea of a total limit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow of labor and pen@@ sions of ministers that the party &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is very clear that it is only against the government plans to reduce the limitation of £ 26@@ ,000 to 23@@ ,000 pounds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
M@@ R Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Party @-@ chairman , with David Cameron , since he has been a T@@ ory Manager , over the last decade , over the Dis@@ patch Box in the parliament .
the Labour leader , which promised another issue of policy , says that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ row@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions on Mr. Cameron and has given more than 30,000 proposals to him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Is@@ lington North MP has said that the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister is con@@ front@@ ated to the Prime Minister and that he is going to teach both &quot; Schlag@@ eter &quot; and the yield with resist@@ ors , and which instead has resolved to concentrate on serious problems like poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people .
M@@ R Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , who will represent it by economic Minister if he is not particip@@ ates - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation , saying that other colleagues will occasionally sei@@ ze the word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ ols , the spokes@@ man of the Lower House , to discuss the problem .
when he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he would need to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theatre &quot; which is often associated with the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister . however , a few years later he had dre@@ amed that he had retired in it .
as she was first aired in TV in 1990 , the Prime Minister and his leadership was viewed as the main Bar@@ ometer of a leader and his position among its parliamentary elections , although critics argu@@ ed that it was become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require extensive re@@ forms .

the F@@ T@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the qualifying share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after the tak@@ eover of the Ri@@ vals AB in Be@@ v entered the market .
one transaction would combine two of the world &apos;s two biggest bre@@ wer@@ ies and brands such as Bud@@ dy , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were able to encourage up @-@ to @-@ use news from the competition Group for luxury products Ri@@ y@@ ont 0.9 % higher .

the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and this could mean that there are less additional jobs .

inspired by &quot; potato &quot; instead of D@@ öner - on a poster the pe@@ i@@ da movement has put potatoes and meat together to a sk@@ ewer .
the idea brought him a poster on a pe@@ dest@@ ine demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes , &quot; which he had seen at random on television .
since then , a grill sk@@ ewer , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ tic@@ lock@@ i for the stom@@ age , &quot; says Al@@ h@@ ay .

Met@@ cash to start floor processing campaign for fighting Al@@ di@@ - In@@ fest@@ ation
a cash is attemp@@ ting to protect the IG@@ A stores in front of a Al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers Met@@ cash has launched a land@@ slide campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the lead of an 700 million dollar Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di opened the opening of two distribution centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , strengths metals and IG@@ A @-@ supermarkets have prepared their relationships with local food suppliers and marketing the brand IG@@ A due to ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am marketing and marketing about the social media , as well as events such as Adelaide @-@ Show .
IG@@ A dealers and suppliers can jump on board , with brands such as E@@ ish@@ man Simm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , distributed in IG@@ A @-@ shops samples and shop @-@ owner who sell tickets for the South Australian Football League on tre@@ ue customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash further details of its defense strategy will be released on September 29 , when the wholesale distributors for food , alcohol and devices pass through its annual investors strategy .
it is a lot on the game because South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A @-@ shop assets and generate higher profit mar@@ ches than met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the Eastern States .
proc@@ urement in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ or@@ ically province capital and IG@@ A retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in Western Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in eastern countries .
however , an@@ alysts expect to Morgan Stanley , that Al@@ di spent twelve months after opening his first markets around five percent of the food market in these two states and all existing ac@@ ters , but mainly independent single @-@ hands sales will take away .
a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath is valued at Morgan Stanley , that IG@@ A single retailers can lose 360 million turnover each year and a meter @-@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this progn@@ osis is based on the assum@@ ption that Al@@ di opened 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA , and will generate revenue of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food prices and with the amount of met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost USD $ 13 million in pre @-@ tax interest and tax , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares in eastern cities , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan had found that IG@@ A buyers were most faithful .
Morgan Stanley is participating in the food and market growth of 3.8 per cent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 , and 2.1 percent in 2018 , will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , with a business lunch in Melbourne , that Met@@ Cash will probably disappear within a decade .
met@@ cash taught it to react to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a member of the board of Met@@ Cash has been contact Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ A market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ at@@ ash@@ s Food and food trade , which has fallen by 43 per cent since 2012 , refle@@ cting its operating profit in the balance sheet of both sales and mar@@ gins .
the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers re@@ igns itself and invested more than 150 million dollars to boost sales prices of Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths with hundreds of products each week and increase fresh foods by increasing fresh foods and deliver a better selection of private label @-@ food products .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Main managing director Ian Mor@@ mon said that the pricing and charging programmes can be kno@@ bs for Elan and hopes that the dealers will return back for the first time in 2017 again for the first time in four years .
Than@@ asi Co@@ k@@ kin@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis courts Steve He@@ aly
than@@ asi Co@@ k@@ ak@@ is deserv@@ es rather praise than criticism for his behaviour .
than@@ asi B@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick K@@ yr@@ gios and deserv@@ es attention to the President of the Australian tennis Association Steve He@@ ars rather praise as a cr@@ iti@@ que for his own behaviour .
co@@ ca@@ ch@@ ak@@ is , the younger of talented Du@@ os , which is always referred to as &quot; Special KS &quot; by the not@@ orious conflict of K@@ yr@@ gios with St@@ an WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters at the spotlight .
in a fier@@ y qualification match in Cinc@@ inn@@ ati , soon , co@@ ch@@ kin@@ is and his opponent had to be separated by the refer@@ ee , whereby Har@@ rison had to strike c@@ yr@@ ae , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was recently seen how he dis@@ car@@ ded a tennis ra@@ cket , after a c@@ amp@@ ot hit a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , coconut oil was def@@ ended by He@@ aly .
the te@@ ens is at Glasgow , competition with Sam Gr@@ oth at second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ finals in the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing about which I &apos;m rather en@@ ligh@@ tened , is the fact that Than@@ asi was drawn up a little in the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he broken a ra@@ cket , when he lost a ra@@ cket in the US Open , but it is not the first player to break a bat of Fr@@ ust with itself , and I know Than@@ asi was good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved himself extremely well in the US Open , even under the pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on and I think he deserv@@ es much recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around , and I believe he was a bit too strictly confi@@ ded .
he is a very enthusi@@ astic 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he worked very hard and so on , he has never worked with the other players , he is trained in the dressing zone , he is good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I believe he deserv@@ es it , according to his own services .
He@@ aly did not support the decision to take the C@@ yr@@ gios at the important preliminary decision , which begins on Friday , and describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term integral part of the team . &quot;
&quot; first of all , we wish that the team is entirely focused on the competition , and not all the contro@@ vers@@ eness around &#91; K@@ yr@@ dom &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly .
and I believe that Nick has made very quickly the asc@@ ension to people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray . he gets in the eyes of the public , but we try to assist him under@@ stand@@ able the consequences of his work , in which he can only think about it , I hold for the team and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declared emergency service , closes the border , with@@ holds refugees
Hungary declared the emergency situation and locked the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all the strong that tried to go illeg@@ ally into the country . everything with the goal of stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed on the border , when hundreds of migrants were re@@ acted to an Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and a Serbian officers .
the people who fled from violence in a country strip on the road between the two control points of the countries , and built tents and settled there .
but fru@@ str@@ ations increased .
as a police helicopter showing them floating , the Mig@@ rants &quot; opened its border ! &quot; and they cried out in acc@@ us@@ ations against the Hungarian will@@ ing@@ ness .
some instructed out of protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign minister explained that it would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; that immig@@ rants from Hungary would come back during more and more from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to have a part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral tor@@ ment .
it must be convers@@ ations with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; Iv@@ ica D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague .
the tur@@ bul@@ ences on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came to a day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ block at a strict meeting in Brussels .
the ministers agreed to divide the responsibility for 40,000 people who would take refuge in the over@@ sight of Italy and Greece . they claimed their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU states would receive more than 120,000 refugees , including some in Hungary .
on Tuesday , Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria claimed a special summit in the European Union to discuss the immig@@ ration crisis of the continent .
however Hungary did not let his hopes on a scale action from Brussels or his neigh@@ bors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency in two southern regions closed on Tuesday in two southern regions to conquer the crisis , so that they could reduce the streets and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ ar@@ to said that his country has also added the construction of a bar@@ bed wire in his border to Romania in order to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country - after it has ended a fence on the Serb border .
C@@ BS News Cor@@ respon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison situations at the race , establish the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in the past few months , Hungary has become for many of war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to an enormous commitment and an entrance point to the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , insi@@ sted that most representatives of economic refugees who are looking for a better life , and not war@@ time flies that are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly in contra@@ diction to other EU countries , including Germany .
the new laws , which went into force at midnight in Hungary . cross the border or damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) tall Za@@ us , who left the government along the south border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws also laying down higher adh@@ esion for tra@@ ff@@ icking in human tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ kers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declared emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Govern@@ mental Z@@ olt@@ an K@@ ov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern town of Sz@@ eged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the parliament must still agree to the military use of the military , which is expected for next week , but repor@@ ter of Associated Press have seen heavy armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security consultant for Or@@ ban , said that authorities appro@@ ached 45 people while trying to cross the border , 15 others were already inside the country .
they come over by being damaged by the fence . they are now committed in police custody and are accused of off@@ ences of criminal off@@ ences under the new laws .
authorities are found to repair the fence quickly .
at Tuesday morning , Hungarian civil servants held two of the seven border rounds with Serbia , after a railroad car had arrived with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos linked the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary had opened a small office in a metal container , to process the data of people and sh@@ ook their lives there to merge there .
about 20 managed to come into , but thousands were outside .
a further group of migrants lost the main highway connection of Serbia and Hungary , saying that they would deny food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead in front of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders at a national pol@@ l
the former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit advance in the democratic races to the nomin@@ ee at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders and her opposite to the ground .
Clinton has now the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters during the elections ( 58 per cent previously ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
Vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced for the presidential election , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters of the parliamentary elections .
more than five months before the beginning of the pres@@ election , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their minds will determine which candidates will support them .
but Clin@@ t supports in their choice more resistant than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey , Clinton has lost some demo@@ graphic groups during a series of demo@@ graphic groups during S@@ anders .
Clinton holds a big lead in women and moder@@ ates , but these are cra@@ cks .
their support for the men is pl@@ ung@@ ed down , and S@@ anders is with only 5 points .
Clin@@ t advantage in democratic voters being under the age of 50 has fle@@ eing , and them and S@@ anders are now on the same height .
however , Clinton has a big lead over the older elec@@ tors .
in the last month Clinton in S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit lead over the Liber@@ al but S@@ anders has now been a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the country &apos;s elections they would say that they would support with enthusiasm Clinton , if they were nominated by the party .
one quarter would support them with some advantages and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candi@@ dat@@ in .
they would not support six percent .
maybe not sur@@ pris@@ ingly that Clin@@ t &apos;s current supporters are all inspired by her .
the views are stronger mixed with those who currently not support Clinton . only one quarter would support them .
while 48 percent of the Democratic Vot@@ ers say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , say , less Republi@@ can voters want this about their peak di@@ alog@@ y Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ t supports the candi@@ dat@@ ure in an open question , the most common answer is that they are the correct experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman will be elected ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
from Clin@@ t supporters , their connection is also mentioned by Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to the problems and the voters are also quoted .
as the vice @-@ president th@@ rows the potential for the presidential run in the Wa@@ ag@@ gression , 57 percent of the Democratic voters will see him in the race - though a third believeth that he should not do it .
if the democratic voters want to be asked for the elections , who would be the second choice for the party , bi@@ ds on top of the party .
by Clinton &apos;s tra@@ ilers say more than half that Bi@@ den would have had its second choice before S@@ anders .
if bi@@ ds decides to run the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s head increases before S@@ anders , of 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race on 30 points without him in the race .
five @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as candidate candidates with the best chances to win the election ; however , this figure has fallen from 78 percent in the last month .
Bi@@ den has increased by far the second in this measurement , but the percentage that it sees him as the &quot; selectable &quot; .
nevertheless , when the question is , what is more important in a candidates , the voters call questions about voters .
similar to the last month , no single demo@@ c@@ rat@@ ory candidate or potential candidate for these voters are the un@@ acceptable .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates bring good results with some important characteristics of voters in the party &apos;s early elections .
new , Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den considered hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ worthy and with strong leadership quality .
biograph@@ ies of the three candidates at the best time in honour , while Clin@@ t &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty per cent of the democratic voters think not that Clinton be hon@@ est@@ ly and tru@@ st@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
there are also Clinton &apos;s elections in general Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ ds ide@@ ology in accordance with their views .
with all these measurements , a quarter of the democratic voters has no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions concerning Hill@@ ary Clinton use a personal e @-@ mail address and server during the term as an Minister of State , most of the Democratic Vot@@ ers are pleased with the explanation of the matter and say that it does not affect their opinions .
but it is a different story altogether in the American public .
half of the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only one @-@ third is satisfied .
the public opinion of this was in March , shortly after the problem of the light came .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail control has no impact on their overall opinion of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion may deterior@@ ate from their own opinion .
there are mainly Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who are saying that their views from Clinton become worse .
although Clinton has watched from voters in their party as a tru@@ sty and tru@@ st@@ worthy , this is still a problem for them under registered voters . only 32 per cent see she considered hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ worthy , eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less since May .
62 per cent of those entitled voters will not hold their tru@@ st@@ worthy and tru@@ st@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 per cent of those entitled voters are also Tr@@ ump as being hon@@ est and not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , received good notes at the guidance .
of the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush are best in honor of hon@@ esty .
a majority look rather than hon@@ est , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion about him .
the error rates for the sample of 351 Democratic elec@@ tors in the preliminary selection amounts to 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son comm@@ enting over Donald Tr@@ ump in the national pol@@ l of the national pol@@ l
Ben Car@@ son is with the latest survey of Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times
the two candidates take a half of the support of voters in the new survey , and others lose dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters support nationwide Tr@@ ump in large number ; the support for 23 % in the last C@@ BS @-@ survey , which was conducted prior to Fox News debate in the past month , by 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son sh@@ oss the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son comes well on demo@@ graphic groups and sur@@ passes to higher education with higher education in demo@@ graphic groups .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio , John Kas@@ ich , is defeated by Wis@@ con@@ sins Govern@@ or Scott Walker , who is fallen below the deep@@ est , and 11 % support in the last month to now 2 % .
the former president of Florida @-@ Govern@@ or J@@ eb , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ sas Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are at 6 % on the third place .
the error margin in the sample of 376 persons from Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C pol@@ l , which was released last week , shows that Car@@ son clim@@ bs in poll@@ s with 19 % support in rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the pl@@ ump with 32 % support .
the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post clearly showed Tr@@ ump to be significantly below Car@@ son .
with a look at the last week of the last week , Tr@@ ump ble@@ w some side @-@ th@@ iev@@ es for the former neuro@@ sur@@ geon , even after car@@ son comm@@ enting himself to question the tr@@ um@@ ps faith in question .

five members of the Brotherhood help the death of a Baruch College Ne@@ ul@@ ings
almost two years after a student has been handed over during a mel@@ anch@@ ous rit@@ ual as a student union in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died for five people .
members of the New York Baruch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ bro@@ therhood was brut@@ ally attacked and delayed his transport to the hospital in September 2013 , when he contributed to his death , police shared the police .
officers told , he was charged with connected eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand while he was tried to attack on a frozen field on a field .
Mr. Den@@ g mour@@ ned over head@@ ache , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was in powerful and waited an hour before they brought him into a hospital so the police .
however , they had the time to switch D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to contact his symptoms and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to bring advice , said police specialists Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point the members of the U@@ ten@@ sil@@ ia started to hide and published the well of the Brotherhood in principle above the by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said poli@@ us ef Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died in the next morning to his injuries .
after a aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeated with a dum@@ b force of violations of the head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the tox@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student died , since 1970 , Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , The D@@ eng@@ s Family , has been involved in a declaration .
brood @-@ ships and their members must be considered to account , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County of Grand Jury of Monroe receive a charge because of murder the third degree for the first five members .
two and thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of criminal off@@ ense and formation of a criminal organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to take part only the involved people , but if it has an organization - officially or un@@ officially - this has never been revealed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Brotherhood Newspaper has banned the Brotherhood , and the National bro@@ therhood has rev@@ oked her affili@@ ation to the town .
that will happen if the F@@ ed increases its interest
an increase of interest increases , and the house@@ number will get in doubt , yields to bonds , and the economy is moving into recession .
we know this .
what we do not know how long will it take before and how long it will take hold .
in particular , the history for the economy is only a low guide to the exp@@ iry .
a recession came within only 11 months following the first interest rate and lasted for 86 months .
the aggressi@@ vity of the Federal Reserve on lifting the interest rates is often , if it is not always a factor that react like the economy and financial investments .
therefore , representative of the US Central Bank emphas@@ ises that investors should not focus on it whenever it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the time period required for norm@@ alization .
in fact , multiple variables are playing a role .
at the end , market participants could determine that all the exc@@ itement was not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for a interest rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will soon be interpreted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Julian J@@ ess@@ op , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , said in a communication to customers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we expect the gradu@@ al return of US interest to normal levels , but still on a low level , in order to open the seism@@ ic shock , that many people seem to be feared .
however , this doesn &apos;t mean that there will be no effect .
here is an historic trends based on historical trends that could respond to some areas of economy :
as the market seen in the last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rates for a while can be vol@@ at@@ ati@@ l .
as soon as the increase meets , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apparently there is a tendency to decrease assets 12 to 24 months after the first order , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said German @-@ Bank an@@ alysts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Deutsche @-@ Bank @-@ an@@ alysts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said after interest increases by the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market is mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate , quite flat in the 250 days after the previous year ( average gain of 2.6 percent ) , then with an average return in recent six cycles of 14.4 percent according to a recent analysis , which was published by Bob D@@ oll , CEO Annex II in Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact of the shares ten@@ ds to occur later to increases in increases and the return of the return begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rates do often promote them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is con@@ fron@@ ted with some conditions which it did not exist before and which could accelerate the recession .
very remarkable is that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at a interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to German Bank , 118 are only twice the nominal GDP of just 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only few that this will take place and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta @-@ value .
interest rates for a frag@@ ile economic drop may be ris@@ ky , and throw the question , whether this time it is different , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank .
market participants have taken up all year on a interest rate of F@@ ed , and all eyes were aimed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists believe and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC might be able to increase in this sitting , the fut@@ ures trade may only have a chance of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all enh@@ ancing data from 1950 to today was taken over a super cycle with increasing weakness in GDP and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; temporary free after the start of recovery in the sh@@ adows &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery of what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is far above the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far .
the solid income was also vol@@ ati@@ l since the market is anticip@@ ation of interest rates , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in shares when changing its strategic course .
with bonds seem to change the direction , once the first increase of / in cycle is carried out .
at the end of the enh@@ anc@@ ill@@ cle involved , the attacks exp@@ ire immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ist of Charles Schw@@ ab believes that the rise in interest rates will lead that yields from longer and shorter bonds are closer to the curve and lead to a decrease of the curve .
highly useful bonds often bring even better income in such a climate even though &quot; we haven &apos;t c@@ auti@@ ous to expect higher income , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ An@@ alysts &apos; in an analysis .
what is interesting , Jones discovered that the markets have already been adapted to F@@ ed strategy requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline of the inflation rate , there are some evidence that the market has adapted to the prosp@@ ect of stric@@ ter monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is broad@@ c@@ lical , credit cards have increased , and the vol@@ at@@ il@@ arity has increased - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tened its strategy .
in the large and entire , companies that will wrap up major part of their business activities in the USA will benefit from interest rates and local products more attractive .
multin@@ ational corpor@@ ations with high debt are worse , since a number of dollars based on global market is more expensive and the financing of its debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to be extremely positive after three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sachs @-@ an@@ alysts &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
firms with strong balance sheet saw companies in excess balance after each of the 1994 , 1999 and 2004 average by 5 percentage points .
businesses with high capital yield and lower volumes in their shares were also exceeded its equivalent to an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts are a big issue .
company with a high proportion of flexible interest will lose most of the people , said Gold@@ man .
outside the pure share games consumers are also benefit through the increasing revenues .
au@@ ster@@ ity could see gains due to higher income , even if experts are different , as fast that will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says the Chamber of parliament Andrew B@@ ingham
the conservative members of Parliament critic@@ ised the transmitter for his &quot; los@@ s@@ ings &quot;
he argu@@ ed that he is not able to distingu@@ ish increasingly from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also shot at the BBC Music Awards and said they only im@@ ited The Br@@ its
Parliament group Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins took the voice The Voice to and said that this was not the original .
BBC Radio 3 , &quot; turns into Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leader of parliament and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does not do something to do the private broadcast@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham said to the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses , that the public broad@@ c@@ aster &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ id &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said more and increasingly often of its commercial compet@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I &apos;m using the word &quot; stup@@ id &quot; but it seems to be Classic FM to turn , &quot; he said .
he was also involved in the BBC Music Awards , starting in December .
the BBC Music Awards , who started last year , seem to be under a different name .
so , if you try to do something different - this is two spont@@ ane@@ ously called examples , in which you are only able to quote what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC @-@ General Director proved the alleg@@ ations back and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of its commercial compet@@ itor if it goes to live music and re@@ conn@@ aissance .
what I learn by Radio 3 I will learn about classical music somewhere else .
and there is a commitment to music and music , which really is un@@ matched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 , new music and new works in order to give new works , I think it &apos;s really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argu@@ ed that har@@ der is to work to eng@@ age the audience , as it was in the past , because the British had been informed about classical music .
radio 3 was however not the only element of BBC @-@ production that during the Hear@@ ing in the Committee on the Selection of Culture , Media , and Sports , to get the commercial ri@@ vals on its feet .
the T@@ ory @-@ member Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins took The Voice to - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was purchased by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for the estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discuss@@ ing because it is not originally and not particularly striking ?
LORD Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - &quot; on particular BBC , &quot; was produced .
he added that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is the next time a entertainment series . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exp@@ el the order from other rows of The Voice in the future or give money of the fee pay@@ ers to other entertainment formats .
net sales increased in August at the slow@@ est and the Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , the lowest result since the record of records began in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago through the use of mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that the black Friday has slow@@ ed down in November .
for over one decade , the virtual shopping was drilled , and many of the main shopping streets of Britain have turned into gh@@ ost town .
but experts predi@@ ct that there are now announ@@ cing that the online sales have stag@@ n@@ ating after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the record number of records in 2000 with only five percent increase from the previous year .
experts predi@@ ct that online sales will stag@@ n@@ ating after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you consider growth rates for the previous years and back to 2000 , it has always been developed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ RG &apos;s index to the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he declared that online sales began stronger than buyers in the previous three years ago to make purchases at their cell@@ phones with their cell@@ phones .
it meant that more people could online shopping they could do that people were able to do so in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now we comm@@ uted one , and we might want to see that growth is reduced .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , which was imported from America , is cited as a reason for the subsequent sales .
experts believe that buyers will keep their purchases before this event , each taking place in November last Friday .
last year , five times the average number of buyers to make their computer to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealer websites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , where buyers will make the buyer take against bar@@ gain , buyers will make purchases of it .
a study by the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium found that out of £ 5 a bit more than £ 1 was issued online .
some products such as TV and washing machines are now carried out more than one @-@ third of purchases on web shops .
at the same time more than a quarter of men bought clothing and shoes online rather than in the mo@@ do@@ ings in the inner city .
Muslims are buried in Mec@@ ca at the removal of the crane @-@ accident - Bin Laden family re@@ auction

one of the dead was Q@@ as@@ im Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage as the crane crashed .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents at the beginning of the annual battle in the Great mosque .
Saudi officials have already promised that the H@@ add@@ sch after Mek@@ ka with thousands of people who continue to come to the city will continue to pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today King Sal@@ man , who had a Bin Laden group &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; could not be standing with the arms of the crane , when he was not used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an Arab version of the decree that was released by the state Saudi Press Agency , announced that the Bin Laden Group is responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English service agency , however , reported that detail , said that the business management team had to be prohibited .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man brought to un@@ veil the fall of the crane , which over@@ threw the fall of the crane , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims arrested in front of H@@ add@@ sch that takes place later this month .
the Bin Laden group issued no statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not able to comment on their opinion .
the Royal Decree also adopted the group due to its current security measures , because they did not co@@ operate with meteor@@ ologists .

B &amp; Q Boss states that the time of the endor@@ se of Eastern European men has passed
Brit@@ ons employ increasingly des@@ people , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry .
the number of qualified men from Eastern Europe took rise behind
this means that 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that aim to reduce power to tra@@ des@@ men .
simultaneously we will close the King@@ F@@ isher 60 B &amp; Q Sales Exhibition
from Ru@@ pert Steiner , City Chef @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent to the Daily Mail
it is claimed that Brit@@ ons hold its hamm@@ ers and brush in favour of the deployment of qualified professional tra@@ des@@ people that perform works in their home .
if you are sk@@ ill@@ ful with a hammer or a brush to submit walls , you belong to a minority which is apparent today .
at the moment , Brit@@ ons increasingly employ workers to perform DIY jobs at their houses , the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
V@@ é@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new managing director of King@@ F@@ isher , which possesses the Baum@@ är@@ kte chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe , which offer services to low prices .
therefore , King@@ F@@ isher is planning to open some 200 Scre@@ w@@ fix shops which aims to judge tra@@ des@@ men and 60 sales offices of B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry told she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the shop are met by women .
at the moment , the men were silent .
she said that it is necessary to have the growing demo@@ graphic trends that have more female single @-@ homes to have more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of males in our branches .
we must move this more to a balance .
in principle half of our clients choose women with 80 percent of the decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women .
women play a big role in the decision process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , one of only five women &apos;s leading companies listed at the top of a British in the F@@ T@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also completed their top team to reflect a equal number of men and women in man@@ ag@@ erial positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including his management and Chief Financial Officer .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - variety is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ F@@ isher rep@@ elled a decline in half @-@ year profit and operations , after the Group bl@@ amed the costs for the closing of the stores .
because of its trends , King@@ F@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q will open 200 new branches .
works of A@@ I / DO@@ B due to lack of court
Klagenfurt joined the Provin@@ cial Court in Klagenfurt on Wednesday two officials of Austrian volleyball @-@ runner @-@ master A@@ I / DO@@ B has to answer to im@@ tre@@ ue and abor@@ tion .
the def@@ endants pleaded not guilty .
one of them was also indicted for counter@@ ing abuse .
he was acquitted of all charges in May 1999 .
the current process was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the prosec@@ utor Robert Ri@@ ffel , the accused had emerged in the preliminary investigation , that the def@@ endants were disp@@ ers@@ ed in the years 2006 to 2011 , the accused of which they were disp@@ ers@@ ed in their functions for private purposes .
he claims the damage with approximately 400.000 euros .
the sports artists are also charged with financial statements .
this fact gave the chair@@ woman of the ch@@ anc@@ en@@ ats , Judge Michael San@@ in , who is the president .
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
the defence den@@ gue that the association had not taken part in the form of a asset to the association at no time .
the sports func@@ tion@@ aries had only been applied and the sports club , for whom they had worked from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had spent a lot of time and money from the debt - the Passi@@ va was around 600,000 sch@@ ill@@ ings ( around 44@@ ,000 euros ) in 2001 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , we stood before the situation : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we lead the club more or un@@ lock ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; one of the accused , a pre@@ ban@@ ker of the financial transaction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants he decided to take this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have pre @-@ poured out money , our life insurance has spent security at the bank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in the feeding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the association it is agreed : you can set the money free , it may only be made no debt .
one thing has been decided in the respective financial and success the payout of allowance was approved until 1991 .
therefore , I have a part of the current damages only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when an increase on the account is paid out .
therefore , l@@ ump and not detailed explanations notes , the former ob@@ s@@ man explained the processes .
the accounts and au@@ ctions were administered by the two accused , said the second accused .
why the dis@@ bur@@ sement of the association were not in detail in detail , the judge question .
the association wasn &apos;t interested in detail in the financial regulation , important to only the debt of debt , such as the answer .
in 2011 , an amount of € 120,000 was transferred to the United States by one of the func@@ tionary investigation .
that &apos;s been set@@ back was declared the accused .
this issue is based on the name of the second accused and was not known according to the association .
&quot; why ? &quot; I wanted to know the judge .
this under@@ stands for a long answer .
then he thought that he was believed that this was the best thing for the club .
if something happened to him , nobody knew something of this money , the prosec@@ utor was in the room .
the co @-@ accused should be informed of the func@@ tionary of the function .
this transfer was formulated as &quot; claim damage . &quot;
why call damages ? , deliber@@ ate judge and prosec@@ utor to know .
this declared the first def@@ endants to have not been understood by this formulation because the association never ar@@ isen a damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what shall I do when the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With whom are all of you from the tail@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; he asked .
Moreover , the func@@ tionary method , he never advert@@ ised as a cent content , he accounted for only o@@ dom@@ eter and di@@ ets .
at di@@ ets he charged EUR 1,000 per month to the association , but the actual costs had been much higher , he added .
the accused were not able to prove more detailed documents during the early years .
these are according to an operating procedure , in which everything was correct , no longer kept , declared it .
the second accused was also involved .
all Beh@@ avi@@ or takes place in cash , in addition to lead to lead people from his place to lead to lead people , he explained in his testimony .
the main hearing will continue on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard presents more than 30.000 jobs
in addition to the recru@@ itment of employees for three years , the Computer giant of the company is going to develop further jobs .
the pitches for the US @-@ Computer Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) are no end .
the U.S. technology group plans to carry out 25,000 to 30.000 jobs in its corporate clients in the framework of its restructuring .
this will be saved in the amount of € 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion Euro ) , the company told the company on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special load of around € 2.7 billion that will drop in the fourth quarter .
the mining of 55@@ .000 jobs has been still ongoing since three years .
at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year , hp had around 30@@ 2,000 employees .

the company &apos;s large @-@ growing group from California &apos;s Palo Alto is currently being split up : this way , the computer and printing business will be bund@@ led in a new company - separately from the future areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business parts should be listed on the stock exchange .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence at the Serbian border
the Hungarian police have used several hundred excav@@ ated refugees on the Serbian border at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water j@@ ector .
Eur@@ on@@ dale @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has experienced the non@@ violence against the border control point .
he reported the phone :
a group of refugees crossed the border .
behind him a police line had formed and behind the polic@@ emen a water@@ front .
40 to 50 refugees begin with stones , blocks and plastic bottles to official officers .
at first , officials were initially un@@ interrupted .
then the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
much rub@@ b@@ ish was spra@@ yed in the direction of refugees .
the group was therefore dissolved .
refugees have now withdrawn somewhat forward now .
a pregnant and obviously last woman was carried away from the zone .
children who had met the Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as , cried .

period of decision on interest rates for the US @-@ issu@@ ing Bank
the world ob@@ serves , if the U.S. music bank has come together in two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision , whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest is raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists that were surveyed by Reuters , found that the F@@ ed could do that the F@@ ed will continue to wait longer and the interest rates on the current level of 0 @-@ 0.25 per cent will be maintained .
it is a historic event because it has been seven years ago since the F@@ ed interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we &apos;re approaching a situation in which a large central bank might be leaving the zero @-@ area and starts a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , leader employees at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is based on a relatively good performance , trillion dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generating only a low level of inflation .
however , the tor@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ cking point of global conditions .
she war@@ ns the markets to increase up an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a one are good .
the decision should be announced at 8 : 00 CET on Thursday
c@@ rank of death at the del@@ ta State University leave his fault compensation
after killing and killing his gir@@ l@@ friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later put his colleagues on his colleague and killing them - wrote Sh@@ annon , saying that &quot; sorry &quot; after the first murder and wanted to do , &quot; he could not make it happen , &quot; stated authorities on Tuesday .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , teacher for ge@@ ography and social science education at the del@@ ta State University , calling the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning ,
and he said that he was shot and a man killed .
Lamb opened the staff of the emergency call to send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I took my wife yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; And he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the house , but he will not distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably exc@@ it@@ eness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police demanded the call@@ ers of his name , but he didn &apos;t show him .
I have no explanation for his shots .
when police have entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ un@@ iss , 41 , and a handwritten notice of Lamb , 45 , the said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I would , I could make it right again .
I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after the writing of the note : 300 Miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , killing them , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening , as a polic@@ emen r@@ amm@@ ing him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt ; but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the reports on Monday the Lamb had said that pris@@ ingly also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , there is no information , no evidence . &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular commitment . &quot;
Pr@@ ent@@ iss has been married by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said they were married for about seven years , than a &quot; good man &quot; described .
the two were di@@ vor@@ ced over 15 years ago , but friends stayed .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , He and Pr@@ un@@ iss had one daughter who is 19 , and it was destroyed in the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ un@@ iss had her daughter &apos; absolutely best friends .
Pr@@ un@@ iss has been working online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ un@@ iss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ un@@ iss , who had a dog called Light@@ ning , had grown in about three years with Lamb .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Know@@ les &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he called for a certain date on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he doesn &apos;t enter into prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a polic@@ emen visited him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville in this night , drove his car to the side , fled to walk , ran into the forest and killing himself with a shot .
Lamb received a PhD from the Delta State University in spring 2015 , as his novel@@ ist at the university &apos;s website .

with the pilot project , there are new negotiations .
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the cheaper Eu@@ ros@@ ings .
orientation of the real@@ ignment is a result of a profit contribution of some 500 million Euros per year from cost and proceeds , divided the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , there is no board for the passenger business in the future .
the low cost of your row@@ ings should be developed as strange as possible .
in order to be responsible for Eu@@ ros@@ ary , the CEO Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r will be responsible for Eu@@ ros@@ ary in the future .
with the re@@ opening , Sp@@ oh@@ r emphas@@ ises the importance of Eu@@ ros@@ ing , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet .
previously , the organization of the 120 000 employees was an complex .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play monthly for months due to double fac@@ ial defects
in the Champions League &apos;s League of Manchester , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double Fra@@ gment of its Right B@@ one .
while this is the left eye def@@ ending and brought it out for at least six months of playing , Louis van G@@ aal is not giving hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season .
the injury was caused by a review of H@@ é@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year @-@ old Sha@@ w was broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and required oxygen before he was hospit@@ alized .
van G@@ aal &quot; he said : &quot; he has a double leg and is located in the hospital . &quot;
tomorrow , he is moved tomorrow or maybe one day later and then in Manchester had operated .
it is aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United comes , it &apos;s very difficult and then happens fantastic , and then this happens .
in the dressing unit he had a oxygen mask .
he wept .
I am no doctor , but if you have a double fac@@ ial structure then takes the six months , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be a red card and a suspen@@ ding lamp in a meter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbit@@ rator , did not pun@@ ish the Mexican .
van G@@ aal believes that the Italian arbit@@ rator had been deceived .
you can decide for yourself if I say that a El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
one twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws Account : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can &apos;t describe it , how that I am , my path to recovery starts now , I get stronger again . &quot;
here@@ after : Manchester United suffered the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in the defeat at the PS@@ V
the European Defence team has an additional incenti@@ ve to recover from the coming June to the coming June .
Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very serious injury . &quot;
when a player leaves this way in violation of space , all are very sad .
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate a opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a strike in Mexico against Van Ga@@ as the Netherlands team at the World Cup in 2014 .
&quot; it &apos;s very difficult because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and if you hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury , isn &apos;t it good , &quot; said Coc@@ u .
it was not possible for me to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball , who had touched him in another direction , so that it had touched him as if he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard can be .
I feel very bad@@ ly . I &apos;m sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought into the hospital - according to a F@@ oul@@ play by Chris Sm@@ aller .
certainly David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax more ?
it is a matter that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book it will not take long until you know it almost extinct .
unless they are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a supplier of child care systems , his favourite chil@@ dr@@ on , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , released in 1971 , decided by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult election , writes Cameron in a message to the site of the company Super Camps , and goes on : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book I like to read my children , because it always seems to have a picture or a message that we have previously missed . &quot;
everything nice and good , except for the subsequent sales of the book , in which Cameron supp@@ os@@ edly describes the action of the book , instead of adding a content of the film version of 2012 , added the new characters and details to extend the fairly short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled town of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all the nature has gone and even the air is a commod@@ ity , it hopes to see her wish to see a real tree , it was read . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name Theodor Se@@ uss was ho@@ stage , and who died in 1991 , however , completely unknown .
as if this is not suspected enough : the text of Cameron triggered by Cameron came partly as the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie that will be presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commod@@ ity , hopes a boy named Ted , to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to the girl of his dreams . &quot;
even though he decided to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems un@@ likely that Cameron stands for action of the book so little familiar , need a bad boy , like the local environ@@ ment@@ ary , Th@@ need of stri@@ ped wa@@ ist , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , car@@ cin@@ ating beings , called the name of the trees , &quot; which is destroyed in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per that The Lor@@ ax didn &apos;t read 20 times in a row .
a l@@ ur@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said that the text might probably come from Camer@@ oon &apos;s elec@@ toral office .
Super camps confirmed that the text of Camer@@ oon &apos;s staff was delivered , but there were no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
to stum@@ ble in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when you chose the header to the UK for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series is not on my card .
I would not finish a step victory .
Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks Homepage is possibly more experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in Batt@@ ing h@@ un@@ ing , and the community is strong ; they will not apply any Nar@@ rows of 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude .
using the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and A@@ DI@@ L Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size on Test level , is an option for the attack .
this news @-@ related message : Adam Ly@@ th leaves the UK @-@ Test @-@ K@@ ader from the UK @-@ Test @-@ K@@ ader and was replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th , of course , is of course for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , heavily . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions and the simple but hard reality is that crime players are al@@ igned to out@@ comes .
there were no fragments with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , as - and I said that - players have their own best sel@@ ector .
a long time ago , we had the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate .
if he hop@@ efully make out further purchases to Yor@@ k@@ shire , a further chance is coming .
the England @-@ trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ ure praised his attitude , even if he did not make good performance , and the sur@@ pri@@ ght me not ; he is especially a team @-@ man .
the question of how much time is a test b@@ ats@@ man , in order to set his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - as Sam Rob@@ son got nine from it - and Nick Comp@@ ton was nine .
only Comp@@ ton received the chance to return home and down@@ wards .
the only deposit which you can collect , was that England initially set Jonathan Trot@@ z in the Caribbean - as the ly@@ th was in highest form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales is coming in , and he &apos;s a stroke , which I guess .
he is a X @-@ factor pl@@ ck@@ et@@ fiel@@ der , which we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season , when he scored 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge square , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same od@@ ds as they received before him , but it depends on the profit @-@ position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to run the Mo@@ een beside Cook , which would kill an extra spin pic@@ kers and receive four blocks , and I di@@ pped it , and I have nothing against it .
I do not see why a stroke can not beat there , and this left stand has already shown that it is a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ er@@ l of Cri@@ cket player .
mo@@ een might not have his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but there is no number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate Just@@ in Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before being joined as a open@@ er in 2001 .
he immediately made three hundred to us and did not return .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari is coming into the K@@ ader as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited approach he has impressed me as a young man .
people may watch his statistics on average 31 with ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball - and think it is a p@@ unt , but there is no big number of backup Sp@@ inn@@ ers who decided to hold their hands and the trainer have op@@ ted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team England has made a few wise additions to the train@@ ee .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ es , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as consultants for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the most important guy of the game , who will bring a wealth of experiences since he has played under all terms and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood is designed for the white sphere stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful operation into the setup .
I always felt that he created for the International Cri@@ cket Competition , as a player or coach , and how Mah@@ ela has in@@ sights from which we can benefit .
sometimes , new voices can be fresh in the dressing unit with fresh breeze , even if the messages are spoken in harmony with the previously said .
coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used in the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot was a similar break around Australia and I have no problem with it .
some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team member do not determine the ti@@ met@@ able .
and you need to remember that as with the players will depend on the results .
such decisions are not taken by slight hearts .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Out@@ side of Britain out of the EU ) could gain ad@@ mon@@ y when the economy moved into a bottle in 2017 .
David Cameron imp@@ aired re @-@ negoti@@ ate strategy to keep the UK in the EU , will be deeper into difficulties with each day , even without choosing the gen@@ ius Jeremy &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C that moves on Tuesday for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ ats , former member states , states that some member states , as deep tre@@ bled in different cris@@ es , as the EU is now and not always origin@@ ate from their own debt , Britain itself , resulting from its own debt and inter@@ fer@@ ing acc@@ ent changes , which they mostly do not wish to be satisfied .
in Brigh@@ ton , TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting in Brigh@@ ton , since they do not like to end@@ anger the social protection .
we could also call the Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
Prime Minister and Minister of Finance to climb up or bilateral meetings at summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , make a photo of themselves before a famous local monument , with or without any local sizes , then come home and say that they are allies for re@@ forms .
it is always about me .
my europ@@ ean friend , who wish you to look outside the Kingdom of the EU @-@ Zel@@ tes - &quot; Let &apos;s not go alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and is able to pro@@ claim that more and more short @-@ sight@@ ings and officials are come in some capit@@ als up to the point where there is no matter whether we remain or go .
in Germany , German Chancellor Angela Merkel is a ally min@@ ed , but she has been in power for 10 years before it looks bad@@ ly when it looks for the ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated exp@@ elling like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
it is also a flo@@ wering force .
Poland , possibly a national@@ ist rule , probably left a Left bourgeois in Spain .
it &apos;s hard to imagine that they will get a blo@@ b to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British to prevent their energy from the UK , Scotland &apos;s leaving from the UK ; something that they do not want to have , because most similar separ@@ at@@ ist tenden@@ cies may have .
hence , some such ministers may not be deliber@@ ately not helpful notes , entirely in the SN@@ P style , during the UK &apos;s speech fight in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , believes my boy@@ friend .
&quot; the new hearing was a Ple@@ ite &quot; and &quot; Great Britain did not win anything from the re@@ hearing . &quot;
Europeans know how to carry out the Fle@@ et Street to their costs and which EU Sk@@ ep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press bar@@ ons , as they were not inspired by Tony Ben@@ n with a ratio of 2 : 1 , with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they are unable to remember Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ Euro Op@@ portun@@ ities who has made a name as an &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade @-@ Ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent in the early 90s .
with all his back@@ ward , Ed Mil@@ i@@ band knew that who were his enemies .
it included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ tri@@ but@@ ors , telephone h@@ ack@@ ing foreigners , and the pseud@@ o non @-@ countries that have most of our big newspapers .
actually Tony Bl@@ air similar to her , but determined that when one s@@ itt@@ eth with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , one gets better ban@@ anas to di@@ stract it , instead of his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mil@@ i@@ band had more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans as Bl@@ air itself , when he contra@@ cted the speaker &apos;s speaker itself , because Bl@@ air had rejected the constitution of the EU which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which thus opened a back@@ door .
the press has never done to him .
but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ b@@ n , who gave me on Monday in Westminster a friendly fl@@ aps on the back - I told him that he don &apos;t need to pay more time for me - seems to repeat in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cott Mur@@ but Strategy of the 80 @-@ Day years , a mistake at that time and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coh@@ er@@ ent strategy to win the media , but certainly with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC as he left the BBC as he died on Sunday .
Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s official position to Europe - I am kind of pol@@ ite - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people out of u@@ ki@@ ps traditional bl@@ ast@@ ar@@ b@@ ye @-@ tendency and wild birds of the new@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can say everyone to say Yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary , &quot; Ben@@ n , &quot; but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and in television this week , not ad@@ mit that Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s became the appointment of the prov@@ oked John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as a sin@@ c@@ rat , a bad idea .
it remin@@ ded me of the 70 @-@ years old when his old father stri@@ ves in television to his Labour Cab@@ inet facing , without losing his cabin and to lose his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys struggle has even more attractive .
but to fight for &quot; under all circumstances - Benn@@ s expression - wasn &apos;t what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell stated , even what J@@ C told his fellow officers and M@@ EP@@ s on Monday evening after all reports on Monday evening .
what also wants to mediate is the touch @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n - remember that he even has touched me - News discipline within the period of TV around the clock is important and especially in the design of the social media , a breeding place of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it &apos;s right to give Cameron no open map for Europe which allows him to keep Lab@@ ours assistance in speech recognition for a self @-@ sensitivity , like Mc@@ Donn@@ ell it said .

experts critic@@ izing Public Health England about e @-@ cigarettes
claims of a state @-@ financed agency that E @-@ cigarettes is less harmful as smoking was created from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco use , said researchers .
experts who write the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , in which they critic@@ ized the reasons related by public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report about e @-@ cigarettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basic report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes him as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but some researchers have made the loading capacity of the data in@@ quiries and also referred to the connections between some experts and tobacco products .
a editorial report in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month , the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily well @-@ known basis , &quot; based on the P@@ he its most important conclusion .
two more researchers have written in BM@@ J and are asked if the claims &quot; on stone or sand are set up . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the outcome of the efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public statement expected that &quot; the claim of P@@ he predic@@ ts that &quot; the present best estimate is that E @-@ cigarettes is about 95 % less harmful to &quot; smoking &quot; on a detailed review of references and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were called to develop a model for a multi@@ disciplinary decision @-@ making analysis ( Multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damages of various nic@@ ot@@ ine @-@ based products . the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose management was to have received by British American Tob@@ acco ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , said they .
one of the 12 participants stated to the meeting , means of an E @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the financing , which he received , according to reports previously by the tobacco company Philip Morris International , was added .
the reasons for choosing the members of the Gre@@ mi@@ ths are not supplied , but several well @-@ known E @-@ cigarettes Champions , some of which also specify a sector of funding in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known to their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting , tobacco conduc@@ ts participated by the P@@ he &apos;s leadership .
the research work of the group &quot; is sign@@ atory , &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products at most criteria &quot; we wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .
however , does not discuss these connections or restrictions in the P@@ he report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the claims of P@@ he say that &quot; there is no evidence that E @-@ cigarettes is as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers &quot; were early .
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims had been re@@ acted already before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigarettes are considerably more dam@@ aging than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ kers die in his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that health risks of e @-@ cigarettes in comparison with small are small , but that we still have the long @-@ term impact .
P@@ he has the unique obligation to the information of the public over what the proof of evidence and what is not , especially when it gives many public confusion over relative d@@ angers compared to tobacco .
almost 80.000 people die annually in a disease with regard to smoking , and smoking will cost the National Health Care System two billion per year .
by clear advantages of recent evidence that E @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of the damage caused by smoking is caused by our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give East@@ s East@@ man , former CEO of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio fee will only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making them publicly @-@ legal programs which are likely to be seen by a smaller audi@@ ences among the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and transmitters such as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson reported that he tries to join Channel 4 for six years in his time at Channel 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes were on behalf of BBC programs , who would also clearly show alter@@ nat@@ ed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communication Committee under the future of BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the radio file , which I need a medium or long term not for a good idea , you should do its production at least on programs that others do not make or commissioned .
they send the Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to reach as far as possible support for the future .
the idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous but of course it is non@@ sense .
Johnson said : &quot; I do not see why a reg@@ res@@ sive control programs financed without subsi@@ dies could also be financed without subsi@@ dies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders &apos;s another program , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
hon@@ est@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I would like to see how this is to be public television .
I do not think that this was going to reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , a entrepren@@ eur for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC were at the hunt for reviews , &quot; because of the amb@@ itions of people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC will return the BBC , Tony &apos;s former Director of Sky , Tony Ball , in Edinburgh in 2003 that BBC shows had to sell the BBC shows how East@@ En@@ ders should sell .
Johnson said that the rather publicly @-@ legal &quot; programs &quot; could go to BB@@ C4 , where they can &apos;t meet the audience , but they can quickly fulfill their tasks , and they can quickly run , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these pre@@ defined programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they set them up in a window , where nobody wanted to see her .
for the broadcast fee , Johnson said to the Committee : &quot; I challenge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions that can get the best value in it .
of course you think all of us think we all think we get a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who is for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me if this is correct , because they consume not much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who testified before the Committee on Tuesday , asked that the BBC had to check their Rei@@ th@@ ian Mission to form and enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said , only a little bit of BBC production would now be classified as education - he said that it will be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example of the public @-@ legal TV broad@@ casts in Australia and Canada , an example , to clari@@ fy and enter@@ tain . &quot;
on the question of the partner@@ ships El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television are shown , and with the commercial must@@ ard will go in order to make everything online .
&apos;@@ son@@ ogen@@ et@@ ics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the N@@ emat@@ odes change the direction around the moment in which it radi@@ ated with sound im@@ pulses .
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with genet@@ ically modified nerv@@ ous systems that can be controlled from the end of sound waves .
the tiny N@@ emat@@ odes change the direction around the moment in which they have chosen for the human ear , which are radi@@ ated for the human ear .
im@@ pulses are working through the power of mot@@ one@@ ur@@ on cells that are genet@@ ically modified to react to the membrane channels , react on ultr@@ asound waves .
further to this topic : researcher , and write deer activity with light
the researchers said the wor@@ ms show the power of a new procedure called son@@ ogen@@ et@@ ics that ultr@@ asound can be used in ultr@@ asound for a number of brain , cardi@@ ac and muscle cells outside the body .
Srebrenica don@@ an@@ th chal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian , that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of Hir@@ n@@ stim@@ ulation , an inv@@ as@@ ive process that gives the electric im@@ pulses to the brain of people to treat symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
days normally does not respond to ultr@@ asound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani reported that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic air bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , he found out , strengthen the ultr@@ asound waves , which would then enter into wor@@ ms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasonic waves operate on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels and detected in membran@@ es of some of the dig@@ nity .
the sound waves operate with the opening of these ic@@ onic channels and activate the cells that they are assigned , such a report Nature Communications .
to create ultr@@ asound @-@ controlled N@@ emat@@ odes , Chal@@ as@@ ani genet@@ ically modified the wor@@ ms so that some of their mot@@ one@@ cop@@ es carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels .
when ultr@@ asound on the changing creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bes , and transferred to the wor@@ ms , where the devices changed the changed turns .
the procedure has some simil@@ ar@@ ities with Op@@ to@@ genet@@ ics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows researchers to switch neur@@ ons with im@@ pulses of light and switch .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ et@@ ics might have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which must be sent to a optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , low frequency ultr@@ asound tissue may not happen , and can be sent to the brain in the brain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene @-@ therapy and a therapeutic virus , it is possible to temporarily represent the addressed human neur@@ ons for a ultr@@ asound signal for certain Neu@@ rolog@@ ical treatments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

eight golden rules for life in a residence halls
after eleven years ago , I moved to a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral re@@ vis@@ m , but only now , I remember the attack@@ ing smile of those who I have been anno@@ ying - and to many , lang@@ au@@ dul@@ ent complaints about others .
most of what I have learned , can be dist@@ illed in eight simple rules .
the entry in a residence halls reaches from slightly nerv@@ ous until absolutely fri@@ gh@@ tening .
it is aw@@ less to t@@ ore : people tell where you come where you come from where you are the Sabbath year , where you don &apos;t love to hate Cor@@ m@@ ite , because in Ernst , guys , it is just a yeast extract h@@ ah@@ aha , I am in my room . &quot;
bre@@ athe in through .
and help others to do the same - Make questions and show you interested .
it di@@ lig@@ ently and helps you to find out people who like to figure out in contrast to those with which you would not speak , even if your lashes were fired in fire , and that fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let men leave .
the rooms of people often turn to drinks @-@ Rez@@ ep@@ tions , film Night venues and public meeting points , but they are also the places where people tigh@@ ten and their under@@ wear .
about this : remember not to start the university with a relationship
introduction maintained a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student halls form a room @-@ to @-@ room bi@@ um@@ mel culture , which can lead friendly and soci@@ ally and lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who is trying to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want to pass on our friendship , but you must go away to keep the energy content that I have used for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a comp@@ it@@ ones of soci@@ ability is exhau@@ sted - and then send SMS messages instead of kno@@ ck .
A@@ pro@@ po@@ s ank@@ nuts : do it .
a guy in my student halls had the not@@ ation that a not closed door was an invitation .
he saw a lot of things .
friendship exclu@@ de through baking .
since you start the University at the high point of the Back @-@ Man@@ ie , the kno@@ ck at the doors of man to present themselves with a plate full of Brow@@ ni@@ es , little bit strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ year &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have something b@@ aked for you . so , and now please smile when I tell you some personal questions . &quot;
our home @-@ made lot@@ tery is a good way to close friends .
their roomm@@ ates are obliged to maintain themselves and will become a delicious surprise at the end of the end .
of course , it depends on whether you are a permanent b@@ aker .
bad@@ ly mixed cl@@ ump from flour , sugar and fat bring that people sleep , if you anchor .
food to steal , is an ancient crime in a residence halls .
of course , the cl@@ aws of chicken is an theft , but is it possible to take a drop of drops for your tea ?
check that with the milk ice sk@@ irt .
the od@@ ds are good that they are saying to use themselves , even if they cook in the inside .
if anyone ste@@ als your stuff , it is anno@@ ying , and you have my compassion , but try to deal with it as my roomm@@ ates , which added a c@@ ushing to her milk , to pun@@ ish th@@ iev@@ es .
she is now in prison .
you should do no noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
it &apos;s not just about to be a permanent man , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ ver@@ word to people who sit in the glass .
a girl on my hall@@ way asked their neigh@@ bors , whether it makes them something to make a drum &amp; bass somewhat qui@@ eter than it is three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a trial on the morning .
they react to sound music with even more lu@@ de music .
when they finally heard about 5 o &apos;clock , she left her neigh@@ bors who kindly allowed to sleep two hours before she left their own music , and went down to the hour &apos;s three hour examination .
would it not be romantic yet if your future sp@@ ouse would happen to move into the same student residence ?
so , it wouldn &apos;t be wrong to go wrong , if you have a roomm@@ ates for your future sp@@ ouse , they turn to her again , and they will see every day , and perhaps to see how they move all common friends ?
of course , the heart is his own way - but if a hot Mit@@ t is definitely not your future sp@@ ouse , try at least try to talk a bit of mind .
in the exciting moment , in which you notice that someone has its key in its un@@ closed room , the border between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing f@@ ails , as it seems .
a good guy is funny , but it takes only moments that it becomes bo@@ omer@@ ang .
share a valuable and am@@ using Less@@ on about certainty - but never vers@@ aw anyone &apos;s room with t@@ ooth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
shut down your door , and place your keys into a glass of water , which you will then place in the freezer - but drives their owners at the blan@@ ket not more than twice .
Ter@@ ra@@ ced houses for Refu@@ ge@@ es , Non@@ violence , Ger@@ ing@@ compressed
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Pop@@ ovic builds in the Central @-@ Fran@@ con@@ ian Eck@@ ental House for people who have not a lot of money .
so for refugees , but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need a residential space , but also the only dec@@ eit@@ ful mother and the Ger@@ ing@@ win@@ ener . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll show how to build and build well today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview
thousands of refugees are in the housing market .
entrepren@@ eurs Markus tra@@ ced Labour to know how quick living space can be created : it builds in a project terra@@ ced houses for refugees .
Mr Gil@@ deb@@ tors , many refugees are on the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
mark Gil@@ bud@@ gets : the mass@@ aged accommodation in containers or g@@ ym@@ s has no sustainability .
for people remain in a great part here .
due to the refugee &apos;s presence , we also need sufficient space in the next decades .
a whole band , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ deb@@ tors : a town hospital needs at least place .
it facilit@@ ates the integration .
that is different if people teach people in blocks .
each of the six houses , which are just built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for four asylum seek@@ ers each .
each apartment has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees are saying that it is peace , I go back .
you can easily re@@ build the houses according to the respective needs .
how high are the cost ?
mer@@ cen@@ aries : the price for 160 square metres of living space per house amounts to 184 000 Euros , without land .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
are your plans complicated ?
Gil@@ deb@@ tors : &quot; my project is legally en@@ forced .
it is particularly difficult to make it possible to get special construction equipment and the user @-@ placed regulations .
gr@@ us@@ y .
there will still be sub@@ du@@ ed , who creates three apartments in a row house three apartments .
only in the cities there is space .
and Refu@@ ge@@ es and As@@ ylum do not have cars .
how did the residents react to their town house project ?
Gil@@ oh : there were those who have had to car@@ ve for asylum seek@@ ers to me .
what is definitely not right .
but do not hesitate to pay the compet@@ itor to pay cheap apartments ?
Gil@@ ded : a true report : we had over the last five years a building boom in Germany , but was built for luxury apartments that can hardly be aff@@ ord more than any more .
my project has the message , also the normal people need living space .
not only refugees but also the mother who alone has delivered alone .
I &apos;ll show how to build and build well today .
that is why it goes .

iOS 9 : how to receive the new iPhone system when Apple Update is released
the new operating system can be challenged by selecting the &quot; General &quot; type and then &quot; software update . &quot;
if it &apos;s ready , the phone allows you to install and then install .
some are removed after installation to problems , since they receive an error message inform@@ ing that the &quot; software update was missing . &quot;
to circum@@ vent the problem , users are recommended to wait either until the rush goes back or try to update to iTunes .
the telephone itself takes you through the rest of the process .
this may be able to create apps to create apps , but Apple has made it more likely to delete all updates . likewise , it will be easier to delete it when using a special tool when using a special tool when the process is complete .
it is worth to make sure your mobile phone is re@@ charged during the updating or located in the vicinity of a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple is not available that the update will be continued by the phone , because the phone could possibly desc@@ end on half way and this can lead to a breakdown of updates .

in addition to consultations it is possible to take part in courses there .
the Social Foundation draws it down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precise to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
there was recently a new architectural office opened recently .
here , immediately next to the shopping market , from now Sen@@ iors and couns@@ elling information provides questions like medical care insurance or services of the nurs@@ ing and nurs@@ ing staff .
for years we have established ourselves with our ambul@@ atory care service that often may be left alone .
there are infinite many questions .
&quot; also , not rare many achievements of the insur@@ ers are not taken into account because the complexity of insur@@ ers are hardly yet understood , &quot; explained the new business owner Jutta W@@ eig@@ h , who is responsible for the Anton@@ ist@@ i@@ ft company and the Citi@@ ist@@ ice as well as for the ambul@@ atory service &quot; Amadeus &quot; .
besides the consultations , the new sales office also offers prevention , health classes and wellness .
for this purpose , the Sal@@ udi@@ s was taken into the boat .
you can therefore use additional offers such as crash prevention , remin@@ ders or a physical exercise treatment .
the offers of the Senior Partner Center and the Sal@@ udi@@ s complement themselves in the ideal way .
sal@@ sa is for prevention , abor@@ tion and re@@ hab .
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; Heike R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ udi@@ s .

for this , there is a good de@@ centr@@ alised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg in the future .
furthermore , the mayor of Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) , at the inauguration ceremony , are dedicated to the quota office at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and this invite for a regular soci@@ able bur@@ ial . &quot;
the institute is therefore a great contribution that they can also live independently and good in her familiar environment .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice Fel@@ low and invests 3@@ 10000 Euros
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ide .
in addition , there are also the natur@@ alist Bernd Bor@@ mann , business promotion to U@@ ta S@@ eim @-@ Schwartz and As@@ endor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert .

after a reconstruction phase , Müller began working on 12 October , till then he will invest EUR 3@@ 10000 in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us Road 6 .
it was sympath@@ y at first sight when the Fel@@ low of years ago Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll met , who currently completed her specialist education in the German Hospital and also commented on practice in practice .
&quot; we always had in mind that the refuse swe@@ ater would fit in this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ resist@@ ausen and laugh@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was come , I simply called them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple pleased the idea to implement his own practice in As@@ endorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; close and constant contact to the patient are very attractive for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to know and accompany families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage , he also see his own boss himself soon .
and so one was involved , the refuse ch@@ urch@@ ers bought the house with practice .

the refuse ch@@ ill , both of the doctors , let themselves refer to house doctors .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after the conversion , the premises of modern look like .
we are offering more ultr@@ asound examination and long @-@ term - and strain @-@ EK@@ GS and need a talk room more .
in addition the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a grant of 50000 Euro receive the tr@@ ash in the framework of a promotional programme from the County ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) as well as from the joint municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euros ) .
&quot; this shows how pro@@ ud@@ ly and joy@@ ful are the practice of the practice , &quot; emphas@@ ises Bernd Bor@@ mann &apos;s mayor .
according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , in the field of Fel@@ low , about 2,000 patients live in the field of Fel@@ low , in the North German Average group there are about 500 .
in As@@ endorf there is another general practition@@ er practice .
a positive effect on practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains at the Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ide in As@@ endorf .
if no replacement had been found , it would have gone .
and at the way , who visited the gar@@ bage course , is looking forward especially in familiar faces : take the seven medical specialists and the cleaning force of the rim .
with their goo@@ db@@ ye in As@@ endorf , there is a era , after all , the medical physician pract@@ ised there for 30 years .
&quot; at the beginning , we had only two rooms , &quot; remember that Ur@@ sel Fel@@ resist@@ ausen spar@@ mun@@ cip@@ ants .
a little bit , they feel like after that long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients often see , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the inter@@ ni@@ st@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband compl@@ ements : &quot; we have an 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have pushed me with garden work but now it may be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the pair has two grand@@ sons and travels .
Croatia : &quot; we let go through the refugees &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls were made up on our south border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said inner minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
insp@@ ections at the Hungarian border remain parallel in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just as it is clear that everyone who wants to put an asylum request will also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the supply and safety of people arise in the fore@@ ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and it is clear that it takes clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the people have to know that we do not accept cross @-@ free migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ corridor &quot; - Slovenia has refused
the Croatian government had previously reported that Slovenia would have further progress toward Austria and Germany in the direction of Austria and Germany and under circumstances , cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
all that this Minister of the Minister of Minister , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ head Z@@ ni@@ dar in the sp@@ aw@@ bach did not see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely in@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is rather to intensi@@ fy the limit of the border - especially to Hungary - intensi@@ fied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the border with Croatia is already controlled as an outside border of the case .
as the ministers approved , Slo@@ th@@ ene wants to make its borders for refugees but not super@@ vised .
&quot; each EU member must fill up its obligations , otherwise the system does not work , &quot; stressed the Gy@@ ör@@ head Z@@ ni@@ dar .
as the Croatian government announced that the first refugees have already attempted to travel in eastern c@@ roati@@ a at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ ID , to avoid the registration process .
Croatian police arrested it in the near corn fields .
according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik live with new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it was mainly responsible for Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , among them numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country negoti@@ ates some 4000 refugees , Interior Minister K@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said .
in addition , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo , on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian Serb border , which had previously transferred to the Hungarian border up to now , reported Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday .
the government in Belgrade , however , suffered from attack@@ ing certain routes , namely : &quot; neither can we , nor want these things to do it , &quot; said it .
according to media reports , some 50 refugees in the Serbian border city S@@ ID had arrived in the morning , in the course of the day some more buses are expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants had been on the road all night of Mac@@ ed@@ onian border around 500 kilometres away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has made us , so we told the police to come here &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany .
as a result I might have been there to be a somewhat forward decl@@ aring in the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a little further west .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities to limit control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had stressed that his country prepared appropriate plans for the fall of a strong state of refugees for possible trips .
&quot; &quot; &quot; details he didn &apos;t recognize that , however , pointed out that Croatia is a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich possibilities for bound@@ ary control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you maintain str@@ ingent checks to qualify for membership in the hub area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have since passed through a good report as far as the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian border you will continue about 300 refugees on the Hungarian border fence .
according to the media reports they reported last night at the border crossing of Hor@@ g@@ os , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border crossing hor@@ g@@ os and Bak@@ i Bre@@ g remain fully locking .
whether the remaining refugees continue to go on the Croatian border is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian Minister of Interior , Neb@@ oj@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic was trying to calm on Wednesday early at a local image in Hor@@ g@@ os : he will keep the debates about alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border has now closed .
it would not be a very high number of refugee quot@@ as .
it could not be said that they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ per rates - hazardous - Alternative items
however , private refugee workers have already begun to spread over refugees to the refugees in which alternative routes through Croatia have already been incorporated .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harm@@ less : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the conflict it is still not clean min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of mine was sent to the border region .

in this way , the investig@@ ators were estimated to have a total of more than 100 million dollars .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are life , therefore we went through the action in the midst of the city and under the people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ea Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;

that , not everyone on the tablets may agree that it is under@@ stand@@ able , however , it is a very personal cause .

F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ Res@@ ult mixed , Finance outlook for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex dis@@ appoint@@ ments dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the Lie@@ fer @-@ Gig@@ ant proved its profit @-@ across for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its transport service .
the company also said that she is planning to hire approximately 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at that time , in the past year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share came to about 2.5 percent in pre@@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a win between 10,@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the business year , which ends in May the next month , 20 cents fewer than previous predi@@ ctions .
an@@ alysts expected a survey conducted by Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower views comes from the price increases , which amount to 4.9 percent on average , and will become effective on January 4 , despite increased supplements for bo@@ oming transport of heavy and large packages that will be raised from November .
the company said that it nonetheless anticip@@ ates that the result compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher income and growth in online trading will be able to increase .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith states that the company has a solid income , especially in manufacturing and global trade , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
the plans for school employment have been announced one day later than that of the ri@@ val UPS , which is planning to hire 9@@ 0,000 - 9@@ 5,000 additional labor force , about the same number as last year .
in the third quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex cleared out 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 US $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , which demanded the twelve of interest in Investment Research , an@@ alysts predi@@ ct .
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion Swiss francs .
six of Z@@ acks were expecting $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority ship@@ ments , which had stag@@ n@@ ated turnover in its unit Express shipment .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results for F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales by 29 percent of the transport transport rose by 29 percent , but the operative result was basically flat because of higher cost of larger pack@@ ets and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit recorded higher income due to higher prices , whereas the result because of higher labor costs in cargo business declined .
in the pre@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the exp@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by $ 3.@@ 85 , or 2.5 percent , to $ 1.@@ 0.15 .
on Tuesday they conducted a 11 per cent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high on June 11 .
at most expected meeting in the year , Federal Reserve Strat@@ us spent two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot @-@ Mah@@ og@@ oni @-@ table to decide if it is time to lift the leading test for the first time since almost a decade .
a mur@@ al of the United States is threatened by them at an end of the en@@ acted , two @-@ storey seat model .
the card is remin@@ ded of the fact that the F@@ ed @-@ President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set the nation &apos;s economic interests in front of all other things .
the Central Bank has held a double @-@ fold order from the congress : maximum of U.S. jobs and prices as stable .
but since the big recession the F@@ ed leader have recognised that there is a third @-@ written mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be assigned to the X @-@ factor in a decision to predi@@ ct them . it is announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to become acc@@ ust@@ omed by the unprecedented access rate from the close to zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it grows sound , the recent tur@@ bul@@ ences against the global financial markets , the already beneficial F@@ ed representative , could increase this flow rate by raising the interest rate by the interest rate - and it is also just around a quarter note .
&quot; apparently , the labour market and inflation will be the most important to observe what they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Head of Economics at the Mak@@ ler@@ ship Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were searching for a pre@@ text to raise interest rate , increased in@@ security around the global market enough for justi@@ fication , continues to wait . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no con@@ sens@@ us about what the F@@ ed is going to do , what is un@@ allocated to the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who have been surveyed by Bloom@@ berg have predicted a interest rate this week .
however , the financial markets are expecting a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key Indi@@ cator that shows a 30 % chance to increase .
this indicates a decrease in the share market , if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , it is because the strateg@@ ists beat the blow di@@ mm@@ ing , saying that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial indicators j@@ ump@@ ed by 2@@ 28@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy lasts the set during this week , John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at Moody &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the propositions at that point , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you &apos;re doing it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would have to be far away in their explanation to calm the financial markets , so that they are not in pan@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that a interest rate on financial markets would be calm , because it would act the un@@ certainty when the F@@ ed would act to eliminate .
still before a month before a month , the F@@ ed appeared on a good way to increase the set by 0.25 percentage points in this month , the first small step in a slow merger of monetary terms which would test the strength of recovery in the USA .
Y@@ elles had said in spring and early summer that in this year , despite the dis@@ comfort of liber@@ als that more cost savings would be required to raise the proposition .
although the creation of job positions in August was solid , improvement at the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed looks as full employment .
wage increases have demonstrated signs of recovery .
and although inflation constantly went under the target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives had said that the main reason is the temporary effects of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of tension in the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ media .
but the financial markets around the world looked together at the end of last month after China had modified its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial Average value fell in May by more than 16 % among its maximum , but they feared that a slow@@ ing down the Chinese economy would thr@@ ott@@ le the global growth .
the market has recovered something for this month , in the Dow Jones accounted for almost 10 % lower than the end of May .
for the F@@ ed Representative , the market tur@@ bul@@ ences affect the complex calculation when needed to increase interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the events on the financial markets and the news concerning the weakness of Chinese economy in the past few weeks would not be , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ lin@@ ers , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the U.S. exp@@ editions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he says that they will wait at least one month to get the impact better in the handle .
&quot; there is a lot of un@@ certainty that will be the impact on the U.S. economy , and there are almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the health of the world economy is none of the main concern is the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be related technically in their decision @-@ making .
but in the final effect , the F@@ ed Monetary Union has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the mere reference of the former Leit@@ ner Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could destroy its mon@@ et@@ ical expansion , &quot; dis@@ band@@ ed confusion around the world .
in a world where markets and econom@@ ies increasingly ass@@ ump@@ ed , can be expected by the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives , that they do not only consider the developments in other locations , but also consult other central banks and experts to obtain a better understanding for the global economy .
its decision @-@ making of more art as science , &quot; Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for the management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , VA . , noted the month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of inter@@ actions on financial market movements , which are linked to the economic foundation of the economic data . &quot;
h@@ acker , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which reli@@ es on a interest rate , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its lad@@ le to a 0.75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited recogni@@ z@@ able implic@@ ations for growth in the US &quot; said L@@ acker .
a year later , the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives had to rev@@ ise these cuts .
the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability during a severe crisis as the market launch in 2008 , Adam S. Pos@@ en , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest rate .
the youngest bra@@ mo@@ il come not near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she will certainly not come to the situation in which she has fear a interest rate because the markets went off &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pos@@ en , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act shall still contain the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not think that it should be the time of time .

Brazil Pe@@ di@@ pedi@@ at@@ ric Society Rio Grande nutrition Nutrition for healthy silent breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS tries to clari@@ fy how important good nutrition during nurs@@ ing time . you &apos;re doing this with the presentation of images of babies that painted on boo@@ sts which are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of protein , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates who provide babies all the nutrients that they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers get advised against daily cal@@ orie intake by approximately 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ eting adjustment to make mothers .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that healthy eating in fact concerns the genes of their babies and protects them from development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child may affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ab sport hall
the Municipal Council Bern@@ ried approved the construction agreement for the 2.3 million Euro @-@ based sports hall .
and he did an exception .
the roof can be used for solar system .
the planning for the long @-@ proved turn@@ pi@@ er at the Bern@@ olina of the sports complex is step@@ ping up step by step : in the recent community meeting , the extended construction entry was also blessed without big discussions .
at the same time , the panel among other things had decided to impos@@ e an application for &quot; Resp@@ ect &quot; exemp@@ tion , from the current planning Plan .
with the &quot; exception &quot; the permission was made for a special form regarding the roof structure .
a &quot; arti@@ c roof with non @-@ si@@ ent first and roof was supposed to be built .
in the background of planning , the scheduled use of roof space for solar systems : &quot; thereby we get a wonderful large Sü@@ dd@@ ach , &quot; Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger stated in the session .
in the &quot; liberation &quot; there was in turn again for the roof @-@ prop@@ ens@@ ity that should be prescribed for energy reasons - less than in the development plan - below 10 degrees .
this will significantly reduce the volume of the hall .
a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan stipul@@ ates that the rein@@ for@@ age plan has no &quot; exceptions &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ ve Municipal Council generally imp@@ acted rather restri@@ ctive in the liberation applications .
in the turn@@ around building , however , it is no recur@@ rent project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent &quot; as St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the sports centre at the sports centre is a community project of the municipality and SV Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros have been calculated .
snap@@ shots are expected from school and maritime transport .
in the next process of proce@@ eding , the building application for the 18 x 36 @-@ metre scale will be submitted to the Parliament and for the examination .
P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg Hospital is moving to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital of P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is expected to be closed as planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) became a new medical director at the hospital of Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of the employees drag by P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this will see the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the district of the district , confirmed the coun@@ tin of Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
a decision on the ruling of the Supervisory Board , and the t@@ arri@@ es next Wednesday , September 23 .
if the plans should be implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg would continue .
the overwhelming majority should be moved with fishermen and to move on to Sch@@ ong@@ au station .
the rooms are present .
the staff , which cannot be called to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered in W@@ eil@@ heim , one workplace is such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
the staff are informed about the plans .
triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who is only having been director of the Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic since beginning of years , and now changes to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
on the question of those who will take over , she came to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; into the game which was ready to take over from 1 October on the line and to switch with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
for the House in Sch@@ ong@@ au this is in every case a &quot; recovery , &quot; and a distribution of the offer in the field of Internal Medicine , &quot; so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .

Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) speci@@ alis@@ es in the interior point on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
over the next two years , fishermen with his team , if the Supervisory Board will lead to the agreed , both houses lead to the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ let , which will have more than 35 beds in the next year , at P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to be finally closed after almost 140 years .
so far , the County had planned this planned for 2018 when the current renovation at the hospital W@@ eil@@ heim .
J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , joined rum@@ ors that the house , which is in possession of the federal government , is to be used as accommodation for asylum @-@ moving .
&quot; this will close . &quot; how it passes by the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say there &apos;s several consider@@ ations .
currently there is a short @-@ time care of Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ li@@ sy@@ chiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better did not happen to us , such an opportunity might be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Fischer about the Qu@@ asi &apos;s move to the Le@@ ch , who had been positi@@ vely recorded by their employees &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the home , where fishermen have been working as a physician for over 30 years , did not give it .
he was asked of ch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take charge of the medical director .
the hospital am@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was repeatedly threatened by closure , departments were closed , for example the surgery and the birth of birth .

refugees need Accommodation : study war@@ ned of housing
the situation on the German residential housing is un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able .
even more refugees are looking for a paid lead .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is in front of a challenge .
the distribution games on the German housing market have long been started .
with the coming refugees and working searching out of the EU more people are on the market that are already over@@ bur@@ dened by many cities .
it ranks with income commitment to citizens for the last cheap apartments .
in order to cover the demand of paid flats , 400,000 new units have to be built by 2020 .
the result is a study on behalf of the Con@@ tract of Social Cap@@ ture . &quot;
in comparison , there are 26@@ 0,000 units in Germany this year .
so missing 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
refugees are no longer required after the first three months of their stay when asylum seek@@ ers live in an initial public holiday .
many walk on the housing market and lined up for the long sho@@ ots in front of the rental dwellings .
according to the Federal Ministry for Statist@@ ical Office , more than half of all asylum seek@@ ers stayed last year .
but the negative development of the residential market does not only lie to increasing numbers .
the study also makes significant impair@@ ments in the housing policy of the last years .
Germany Shi@@ ps a H@@ ousing deficit in front of itself , which is bigger one year ago .
at present , Matthias Günther , author of the study , has already been missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas .
there are therefore many jobs in gener@@ als in major cities in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults stayed un@@ voluntarily even in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
in the big cities the number of square metres per capita has fallen back for the first time in the past few years .
in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social housing &quot; suggests a re@@ boot .
another incenti@@ ves to boost your social construction sector again .
so , the under@@ value tax could be ren@@ ounced and the basic tax for sponsored dwellings shall be suspended .
an attractive tax @-@ depreciation is also necessary in accordance with the Alliance attractive .
the funding programme for refugee family Kf@@ W come well in cities and municipalities already well .
a good week after the start was raised to € 184 million more than half of the available EUR 300 million available .
now the project could even be enhanced .
refugees have free validity : Croatia and Slovenia are located a corridor
after Hungary is virtually no more pic@@ kl@@ ed , since more refugees now choose the path over Croatia .
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the passage through Slovenia to the north with no hur@@ d@@ les .
but dangerous is the route but nonetheless .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country Slovenia about the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke with the Slovenian Minister of the Interior , and when it &apos;s necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Croatian Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and belongs to the Schengen area .
Croatia &apos;s EU country is not a Schengen country .
according to the Serbian border , hundreds of refugees moved to Croatia to reach Western Europe .
500 people were killed about the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian TV broad@@ c@@ aster RTL group .
Hungary had sailed its border on the pre @-@ day border for refugees .
new laws , which came into force on the same day , are virtually super@@ flu@@ ous in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ ano@@ vic said , &quot; You can go through , and we prepare for this opportunity . &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and want to achieve something .
however , people who would not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police arrested the first refugees on Serbia on the EU neighbourhood of Croatia .
most originated in media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both by bus and tax@@ en to the Serbian border city of S@@ ID .
immediately after their arrival they had tried to reach on foot from the green border to Croatia .
on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees shou@@ ldn &apos;t fly into the border .
for that , the border strip measures other haz@@ ards : there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 90s .
Min@@ e@@ dre@@ er is now able to quickly create a secure passage .
after Hung@@ arians comes after the closing of the border , hardly more refugees arrive .
on Tuesday the police amounted to 366 people .
shortly before closing time on Monday it was still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws repe@@ ats the over@@ coming and damage to the border with us as a stra@@ pping at .
in the south Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eged , 35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated .
the convicted shar@@ pen@@ alties for up to five years and deportation of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the immig@@ ration authority I took the newly set trans@@ itions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trans@@ itz@@ ors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total 94 , including almost all - 93 - most import@@ antly from the main transition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the applic@@ ants are 13 families with small children as well as two older people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees .
however , there is no longer a view that granted asylum in Hungary .
after Hungarian view , Serbia makes a &quot; safe third country . &quot;
the past ten@@ ants are to be sh@@ aken there .
two hundred migrants were gathered in front of &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke the workers began to round off with it .
they raised the rub@@ b@@ ish , left the tens of thousands of people in the previous few weeks .
pl@@ ywood were dismant@@ led and one of the im@@ aging camp in the border was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to express itself to the target of this reconstruction .
Austria is only a few refugees after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country has increased its border controls .
but around 20,000 migrants , however , they still remained in the country .
in Salzburg about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany .
the train service from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the German authorities .
in the wheel , smaller groups of refugees have met on foot regularly .
Mayor drove &quot; Gest@@ ure &quot; on the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy after the bridge on Sunday with the dream when ten people suddenly stood with rice @-@ off@@ ers at the entrance of the Zel@@ da &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; W@@ ern@@ st@@ one Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go to Pass@@ au by train .
because Germany had sur@@ pris@@ ingly offered to Austria on Sunday , but because of the refugee train had sur@@ pris@@ ingly sur@@ pris@@ ingly in Austria , a city that immediately offered its assistance and ran together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border into the Middle Pass@@ au border .
first we had d@@ anced the un@@ hop@@ ed guests only once , with snack and drinks .
we said it , we drive them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grat@@ eful .
a man did not let it take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; that has enjoyed us very much , &quot; Stad@@ ler .
the stressed train papers were moved on Sunday evening in Wels from a ICE in a regional direction to Pass@@ au , in order to follow it after the notice that the railway traffic was set to Germany but still try to try the border .
the regional train was completed at the Inn in front of the border in W@@ ern@@ stein at Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high on the course .
the bridge association with the Bavarian neighbours must be handed in on Sunday , at the time a branch @-@ bridge sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
so Viktor Or@@ b@@ án sends thousands of thousands to us , is a logical result of a apparent di@@ lap@@ se policy :
rather than in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , with the establishment of structures , humanity ensure humanity , our Federal Chancellor , highly officially decorated and publicly presenting the post@@ ure of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ ace@@ ans of National Soci@@ alism .
unfortunately , the makers of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now con@@ fron@@ ted with the border areas with cha@@ otic areas .
the poultry farmers will have to state that the &quot; yellow land &quot; which they invited and welcomed , nothing as another refugee camp is required .
it will be a major challenge in view of the continued group of refugees and of the near wind to manufacture tra@@ de@@ cent states for gu@@ arding .
and there will be bigger , peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the quest for 35,000 win@@ ou@@ te@@ .de
Konrad has filled all his hands with the refugee of the refugee .
Christian Konrad is so usual that his word has weight .
the government has deployed the earlier powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Ban@@ ker to put arti@@ facts for the thousands of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chaos within the Initi@@ al Centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen already received a grip on Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t have any hom@@ eless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success .
the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday were without great confusion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organiz@@ ational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master output &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the Interior Ministry said , on the occasion of a &quot; k@@ ins@@ ane situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad accounts for a total of 85@@ .000 kinds of mar@@ es within the he@@ y@@ day year .
to fulfil the number , in the next few weeks , 35,000 properties is to be found - 20,000 are to provide the country , 15,000 of the Federation .
if there are more refugees , we can make it .
&quot; but it is not a barrel without the ground , &quot; Konrad .
he has already led talks with the state capit@@ als .
these have been m@@ apped to give it to the coming refugees too .
&quot; in Upper Austria it works well , &quot; Ferry Mai@@ er said .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ume supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christophe Schön@@ born , but it &apos;s supposed to be clari@@ fied as the church will help .
great expectations - As@@ ylum re@@ coordin@@ ate even in the ORF @-@ Action &quot; Hel@@ ps like We . &quot;
on the platform , individuals can offer un@@ complicated accommodations .
additionally , we hop@@ ing for hotels that remain empty in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ized the standards for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly highly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in note times it could not be that qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ature must hold a certain height of the hand @-@ holders or size of the upper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for temporary times , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards have to be considered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Interior Ministry at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Foreign Ministry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Konrad with his experience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am an older gent@@ lem@@ an , who man doesn &apos;t say without further into the face the un@@ true .
traction power is its most important gun .
Konrad and Mai@@ er cause their republic no costs as they explained themselves .
your number will increase to three to four .
the own qu@@ arti@@ fts has not yet been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to put a container at the st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz demands a better breakdown
no opening of municipal swimming sports events and other buildings like tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is currently no need for people who can now accommodate these measures without these measures , says mayor Klaus Lug@@ er ( SP ) .
however , for emergency , more sites have to be checked for their exchange .
criticism of the Municipal Head in the distribution of refugees in the federal state .
other districts must also aff@@ ord its contribution here .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not isolated &quot;
in a longer telephone at the Bavarian Minister @-@ President Horst Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ehr@@ inger ( VP ) adopted a further deal in the refugee &apos;s request on Monday .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er has covered me that the German borders are not isolated .
the further journey of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible .
however there should be the respective border controls .
special trains with refugees to Germany will not be available anymore .
however , the gu@@ ill@@ ers would have been brought to Germany with regular trains .
from the other EU member states , P@@ ehr@@ inger requested more reinforced solidarity in the refugee &apos;s question .
for P@@ ehr@@ inger , Austria is now re@@ marked to its borders , it is a logical consequence &quot; from the fore@@ head of the Germans .
the next r@@ unt@@ astic is a question of time
the reconstruction of the &quot; New C@@ ast &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industrial line is officially finished .
the IT Group S &amp; T is located in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the remainder ( 2700 square metres ) is to be hired to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; in IT , the smart heads are our raw material - and we are trying to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine to invest in start@@ up companies in the new ship@@ yard , and later they will also be awarded .
at the beginning , S &amp; T wants to co@@ operate with the new neigh@@ bors , where Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; the next r@@ unt@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
at 1.7 million euros , S &amp; T invested in the site , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ center , which is one third of the city of Linz , the Land Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is designed by Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ center .
30 percent of the 2700 square meters of residual surface in the building are already rented , for a further 40 per cent there is en@@ quiries .

the project had to put on the 49 @-@ year old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ern market @-@ Ark@@ ade . finally , it has now gained an increase in another business .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ shop , over the business , in which they sold bags , suitcase , shoes and clothing of various producers , all now rot@@ ates for ladies bags of the brand vene@@ er , a fine stock exchange from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop is in operation since yesterday .
this was rebuilt several weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have long left , whether I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Bre@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
decisive for the decision was among other things that also the Fur@@ la producers who are in Bologna at home , from the idea of a private site , at which only its hand@@ bags are sold to be sold .
&quot; we are the only one in the big region of Linz , that sell this stamp , &quot; says the mother of two daughters , which has even Italian roots .
your search has been given for Bre@@ it of her mother in the cra@@ dle .
it comes to me most , when something developed and I can show new trends for great prizes .
why as many woman in the appearance of a beautiful hand@@ bag in a taste , the woman can &apos;t answer with the last security .
perhaps it is clear that a beautiful bag complement each out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ et from K@@ all@@ stadt
the ag@@ el@@ zer predecess@@ ors of Donald Tr@@ ump came out of a place whose residents are called .
this feature connects to some of the billi@@ on@@ aire , the US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for exc@@ itement .
whether he ex@@ presses his host@@ ility , journalists Rü@@ de , or lack of knowledge in the international crisis policy - candidate for the US presidential election to significantly cuts the election campaign .
and cuts well .
this will also be registered in the pe@@ el@@ ic@@ onic K@@ all@@ city where the grand@@ parents of the property ( billi@@ on@@ aire ) .
the New York City of An@@ ger@@ fr@@ is@@ ur is a term in the wine bar at many times in the wine @-@ gro@@ dorf .
maneu@@ ver in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants place is related to it about -@@ fifty corners that is related to it .
his grandfather arrived from K@@ all@@ city in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in elec@@ toral law mode .
the town of Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal , the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe it was exciting , but in their old city is not so much less impressed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has made an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous spro@@ uts in addition to which Tr@@ ump also belongs the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for env@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too , with the statement that he was certainly also successful when he would live in K@@ all@@ city .
he has not brought it to the king &apos;s heart .
indeed , respect for the performance of the family , but also ten@@ ds the opinion that Tr@@ ump has already been a little Mo@@ or@@ ish , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
inci@@ dents in the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the vicinity , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - too high German : the An@@ ders , says it .
Tr@@ ump is then coming out of the village of An@@ acts .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather was emig@@ rants and opened a place for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
founding of the real estate group in New York were the corn@@ erst@@ ones of the real estate .
but the life of grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : her wish to return home to the home , failed to the Bavarian state to whom the Pfalz was back then .
he was not accepted Tr@@ ump because he was once def@@ ended without homologation , had the Director of the Institute for Pentec@@ ost@@ al History and People &apos;s Cheese , Roland Paul , to film start .
Tr@@ ump was the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal emig@@ rants . &quot;

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
revealed secret ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have to be ignor@@ ant that who wins the Bachelor .
the woman when the Sam Wood was cl@@ ashed in the Bachelor , was buried in the largest secret guard .
and no one of the three remaining girl will certainly not give it , if she is the one that has received the last rose .
but when we were with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons rock falls on the day before coming out of three two , you possibly have left a hint on which the winner will be .
Sam Wood keeps his lips to the final on Thursday .
all three women have left over the ly@@ ric method , why Wood is the perfect man , and they called his sense of hum@@ or , amb@@ ition , family values and positive attitude as good reasons why they would like to be his partner .
however , if the question is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you do not mean , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you don &apos;t have to get her last rose ? , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; might have won their answers to the game , who won the heart of the Bachelor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows und Mark@@ os@@ ki quickly changed both - but save himself - m@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner in Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had joined one simple relationship between the first day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the moment when I went into the house and ( Sar@@ ah ) and Sam@@ son &apos;s energies , I felt that they were rather compatible , and I thought that during the whole course of the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah has two feet on the earth , making it so much fun to be along with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood are well suited as a pair .
from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week made it clear that Wood &quot; could be &quot; One . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it was clear to me that this is obviously not only a game - I &apos;m already waiting for him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked , whom Wood should choose if she was not , she was av@@ eng@@ th@@ fully .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a decision between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor will be broadcast on Wedn@@ esdays , 19 : 30 on Wedn@@ esdays .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his NF@@ L career .
Detroit and Seattle showed big interest after moving to the United States - and there were many other teams that sent in@@ quiries to its impressive training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainer would have banned the rest of the game to the Bank , when he lost a sh@@ angel , as it lost the Aus@@ sie @-@ Rug@@ by @-@ League per@@ vert@@ it during his first P@@ unt @-@ Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted in his husband and gave much the next opportunity to take a P@@ unt @-@ Return and also to the current play after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula showed his true face in the dressing unit after the game .
he encouraged them instead of his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the remainder of the team .
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ es also publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ ti@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encour@@ ages by E@@ ti@@ g@@ am Co@@ ordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who ri@@ pped it to take care of his pat@@ ern@@ ed fish and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne is patented in a p@@ unt , which was restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start to see the Hay@@ ne and massive Australian dealer for his NF@@ L @-@ debut .
Hay@@ ne left the game field after the f@@ um@@ ble and related to the Australian radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a bad start to his NF@@ L career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing which is going to come in , only takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne wins the shar@@ pen@@ er with his fixed debut in 2007 , when a pass led to a T@@ ry in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

M@@ R Dh@@ ak@@ al said the police have set Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and then put up into the air before they dropped on rubber compound .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rub@@ ber@@ ing installed , of which it is known that they can kill as much as less dead@@ ly alternative , evi@@ d@@ ently produced a so high death rate .
the con@@ front@@ ation was the last in weeks wav@@ ed protests in Nep@@ als southern planes , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ h@@ esi say that new provinces , which are formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution to reduce their political influence .

what exactly on the good one hectare estate is happening inside the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must have a very close approach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ralf Behr@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

for slightly revised diabet@@ ics , weight loss can be helpful .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for mild to overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say if easily overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery may live longer than those who do not get surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of the weight loss surgery , who wrote an article to the new study in j@@ ama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss medication or Adi@@ pos@@ itas @-@ surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to welcome food .
over the years Adi@@ pos@@ itas @-@ operations have been efficiently used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies were carried out in people who are ob@@ sol@@ itary ob@@ ese with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or above shows that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI over 30 are considered ob@@ ese .
you may have here your BMI : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ w@@ l min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital Personal collected them since 2007 and compare two types of Adi@@ pos@@ itas @-@ Surgery - Mag@@ enb@@ ypass and Mag@@ en@@ schl@@ ager Education - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BMI below those under@@ going this surgery decreased from 31 to 2@@ 4.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
the BMI with those who did not mean surgical treatments were approximately equal to 29 .
amongst those who underwent surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was totally dissolved and 28 % partially .
in the medical @-@ treated group , the Diabetes Care reports only one percent in comparison and in part at only about two percent .
in addition , results in controls of blood pressure , tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des and of the bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol &quot; were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group &apos; , the authors found out .
the researchers also super@@ vised the patient &apos;s blood level in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept by 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the operation the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; glyc@@ em@@ ic Control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease mortality in five years , so as the leading researchers Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also assess average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery was lost more weight ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) in comparison to the gast@@ ro@@ tom@@ y group ( 7.4 vs 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete payment of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study showed no survival benefit in the surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of severe people in Sweden , that operation leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was in ob@@ ese people who underwent a Adi@@ pos@@ itas @-@ surgery , about 29 percent less probably in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that attempted conventional methods .
although the new study did not have advantage for survival in the surgery , Black@@ stone said that it is soo@@ thing for people with a BMI of 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in the lower BMI group , &quot; without reducing the risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors begin to start weight as soon as the patient lies with its BMI between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we will wait for long until we bring people to take this seriously . &quot; she said .
I think that once they have collected this genetic changes that have attached their body with obes@@ ity and diabetes , is really hard . &quot;

Europe could not accept all refugees , the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East may fly .
the Tibetan Buddh@@ ist leaders ur@@ ged to end violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama spoke the problem of the continuous refugee crisis to the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit in the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford which is dev@@ otes eth@@ ics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances , the interests of humanity before the interests of the individual nations or even Contin@@ ents were to be judged .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries on the refugee crisis is ad@@ mi@@ red , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
though the Dalai Lama thought in Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to encour@@ aging the crisis , he stressed that there was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to worry about several thousand refugees , it is wonderful but in the meantime , you need to think about long @-@ term solutions as a real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , we must think about it , as the killing in its countries is reduced .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application of violence has never solved these issues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama states the problem of violence and commented on George Bus@@ h@@ s actions after the terrorist bombing of September 11 and turned out that the violent reaction of the United States covered a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my supplement in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem is non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know , his moti@@ ves were good , but he put violence , and that was not some unexpected consequences &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of ham@@ mo@@ cks due to children in the past 4 years
the U.S. control centers in the USA have an almost 400 percent increase in number of children under the age of twelve who swal@@ low a strong alcoholic drinks . Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord L@@ op@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , reported cases of revenues of waste disposal in children under 12 years , while po@@ ison control centers , from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are increasingly being more common to these products , and unfortunately , a percentage of them will go to an emergency cap@@ tion , &quot; L@@ op@@ ez CN@@ N said .
he said that some children of disinfect@@ ant d@@ ently drink , while some do they do to im@@ press her friends or due to a mut@@ ation of social media .
videos on YouTube will show how young disinfect@@ ants are only drunk due to a budget experi@@ encing .
yo@@ ungst@@ ers have mixed disinfect@@ ant with alcohol content to preserve a har@@ der drink .
younger children can be activated by attractive sc@@ ents of disinfect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think this is po@@ or@@ ly for it , &quot; L@@ op@@ ez said .
many of the attra@@ ci@@ des ( hand @-@ disinfect@@ ant ) are those that are par@@ li@@ ant .
there are disinfect@@ ants with earthquake , grapes and orange sm@@ iles that are very attractive for children .
detection coats contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
particularly with small children , few spra@@ yers can lead to alcohol po@@ is@@ oning .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medi@@ cally director of the Arts Centre at the University of Kansas , the transmitter of Fox 4 in Kan@@ sa City .
so , you would have left no si@@ p whis@@ ky , but people let this hand @-@ disinfection in reach of children , and if children come , then it &apos;s a fast way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who has recently taken four sprit@@ zer from w@@ berry to the ham@@ mo@@ ck to the school in school , was brought to an emergency recording .
her blood @-@ alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold where applicable under an adult , Dr. Chris R@@ it@@ ch@@ ey said a emergency medical doctor , which treated them in the G@@ win@@ nett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ all@@ ed her words and was not able to walk when she arrived in the emergency .
doctors super@@ vised the night in a separate children &apos;s disease on the signs of Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ ma , because the girl had fallen by the alcohol and had st@@ oned off the head , R@@ it@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; that was very anxi@@ ous , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ ahu &apos;s mother , CN@@ N .
it could have been fatal for my child .
L@@ op@@ ez has parents and teachers strongly recommended to use alcohol @-@ free products or disinfection systems outside the child &apos;s range .
some disinfect@@ ant associated with deaths were associated to alcohol in@@ tox@@ ication .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario were killed after the slaugh@@ tering of ham@@ mo@@ ors , which had a toxic , non @-@ clear ingredient .
the health authorities are assum@@ ing that the product contain me@@ thanol , a dead@@ ly solution instead of ethylene alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient .
in January , three students from the fourth class in New York State , their &quot; gem@@ m@@ oned &quot; teachers were in@@ hal@@ ved , adding anti @-@ bacterial products to the class@@ room . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic against hand@@ securely and made them out of their room .
the police looked at the di@@ vor@@ ced plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gesch@@ w@@ et@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and inter@@ disciplinary action to the school . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the former Rang@@ ers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Cel@@ tic , since there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the rank@@ ings .
de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland they do not show highlights of Cel@@ tic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the rank@@ ings are not there .
people are not only talking about the return of the leaderboard .
they speak about the Old Fir@@ m .
they speak about both teams and this is what they are interested .
there are a lot of tension in the Old UK @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not only those people who want to see these games .

D@@ eil@@ a said , &quot; Cel@@ tic had already been bad times before , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to get as soon as possible .
I know , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel that exactly , but we have to go on .
we really need to Cel@@ tic the support of Cel@@ tic because the player gets better .

the ex @-@ Chef von Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; the January @-@ Transfer window is very different from the Summer window . &quot;
the players who come in summer , have this pre @-@ season period to integrate it what you &apos;ve seen with our own group in this season .
the crew really is good .
sometimes more damage has caused by making un@@ necessary players to add what you really need .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while they grow in the United Kingdom in total .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work was employed for the United Kingdom , as a whole in the same period by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate was 5.9 percent higher than the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 per cent , as the offices of the National Statistics Office ( for dating only ) .
in the meantime , the employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 across Europe during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 .
the unemployment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent in the course of the quarter - a number above the UK @-@ average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundations for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has made the historical decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market to raise employment and a decline in unemployment .

why I shall be the execution of execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a little later , except with a late intervention , I will see how a man is put to death .
when it happens , and I hope that it happens , I will sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber at the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the tox@@ ins by the tox@@ ins .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was first performed in January about his best friend , and although I wasn &apos;t sho@@ cked to vote .
when the day came closer , I began to fear myself .
so why should I do it ?
it voted , because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell all the story about the death penalty .
there would provide a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists can see exec@@ utions in the US , and there are often more applications available as places available , a ma@@ wireless lot@@ tery runs to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media areas from 12 to five .
who is selected , watch it emotional .
I cannot do this .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ s@@ ps of a friend , with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with telephone lines and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh@@ ed much if we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen that I see what I see .
I just need to try to remind me of all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of acc@@ use me on Twitter , my im@@ part@@ ent@@ ment .
this is the lesson .
tell the story of the det@@ ain@@ ee as he wants it , and you &apos;ll receive access .
I compl@@ ained with her .
she dre@@ amed a saying that it would have been better form@@ ulate , &quot; but it &apos;s always remember that it is wrong , what I do .
Richard Glos@@ s@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he says not to me what I write to write , and I would not do it , even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants to present an international repor@@ ter there to write there .
when he dies , he th@@ inks that the public relations work against the death penalty will help .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of po@@ d@@ casts that I made .
I don &apos;t want to go down here again to all details .
I can &apos;t say with security that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his acts after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would ow@@ e him to be a benef@@ ici@@ ary of fact .
but I believe that a strong probability is that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe in fact that there is not enough evidence to justi@@ fy a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is false .
and from that perspective I will see him .
I can not claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ter in which you can turn .
as you can get from me , what it means , a man to die for un@@ necessary death .

an attempt by a man of Perth with the police was successful when he found himself in the ble@@ ach and sum@@ p@@ part water , just a few meters away from a police officer , who tried to persu@@ ade him to return to the bank . &quot;
the c@@ anning of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called on Tuesday to a house @-@ di@@ ver incident in Beck@@ enh@@ am .
when she discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water@@ - and said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
con@@ un@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too excited to make his uniform , therefore he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic , &quot; A good policy is negoti@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do good things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine .

Peter Moody claims that st@@ ew@@ ards sought to get rid of him and thre@@ aten to race the race .
Peter Moody claims that st@@ ew@@ ards of Racing Victoria tries to install a sp@@ y in its st@@ ables and threatened to stop the race immediately .
he claimed to the st@@ ew@@ ards and the integrity of Racing Victoria and claimed that they had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Sc@@ rat@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai on Wednesday for a racing day treatment , the last Stro@@ h@@ eck on Wednesday .
today , Fair@@ fax Media said that he always tried to do what is best suited to racing conditions and he himself found himself in difficult conditions as it went to the positive co@@ b@@ alt @-@ frequency of Li@@ dar@@ is that he could not explain .
he kept 18 months due to the sp@@ y court and would not want to see that it looked as too high @-@ carrying grapes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say , and I have fun to eat on it , but sometimes you are fru@@ str@@ ated that all at once come out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it was far from that .
sometimes we re@@ acts , and you have to live with the consequences , and I must live with them that I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I would like to make a high head , and I want to think that my owners try to try my best for them .
if you start thinking , I do not do it , then I should be no longer a coach .
I have to think then what I do with my license .
prior to the end , the bomb had made up@@ swing in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , trying to intensi@@ fy the integrity of the Integ@@ rating attempts .

they apparently believe that I am a che@@ at .
if that is the case , she will certainly receive her n@@ oses because they have failed to hold me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of Route L , David Moo@@ g , former president of Route L and Bernard Sa@@ w , has been the current CEO of Route L , and are currently aware of the time and are still today .
should I bring this to the view that it will be personal ?
has Route L continued to ass@@ y yourself and is responsible for people out of the train@@ ers responsible for what is happening in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps the people think outside , I am there .
perhaps they have to take my license and viol@@ ate me , and I have no doubt that this is what I say to you now think about it now .
but I am coming now at the point where the matter is , and that doesn &apos;t make me sad .
that makes me very sad .
I &apos;m going to ex@@ ert the pressure on them and push it to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the training levels of the Train@@ ers have been rebuilt with the long @-@ lasting co@@ b@@ alt @-@ examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Sc@@ rat@@ ching did that he could take his license to the table . &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ uma f@@ ights against ri@@ vals for claim against ri@@ vals
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ ev has review the criticism of his player as &quot; Agenda &quot; setting &quot; by two Premier League &apos;s favour@@ ites of N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rator will award the Storm @-@ players &quot; ring combat &quot; with his team during the qualifying finals in Sydney on Friday evening .
Brisbane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Bennett made a very little re@@ mark on the Storm team , after his team had finished the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land C@@ ow@@ boy on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; the Rug@@ by League , and said that the two men from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; to be good &quot; in rings .
Bell@@ amy authorized the pe@@ as@@ lim@@ g of his team and said that she is concentrated on their &quot; contact &quot; at the Tac@@ ron .
Bell@@ avista added that the cr@@ iti@@ que of two leading trainer in his team agree on him , since it is supposed to be wor@@ ried by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it appears again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent &apos;s Robinson was beaten up , when they defeated us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ avista in Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing to our def@@ ensive system or the techniques . but in the last six weeks we made our contact with tac@@ kl@@ es a real focus , and this has got the trend revers@@ al for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not to lose it , so it was a bit of shock for him .
it &apos;s already funny as it appears again to this season .
Bell@@ et@@ op has attacked the idea of &quot; exciting soccer - attacked and his ment@@ or remember that Benn@@ y St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; long @-@ long &quot; soccer winning .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
he threw his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; said Bell@@ avista .
I remember that in 2010 St George was critic@@ ised as a long bor@@ ing team , and Wayne told that he would take care of a di@@ vor@@ ce of her .
but now he has a team that can play and watch it as exciting , especially its young players with their speed .
this is the ball game that you want to play when using this type of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so that they can play like this .
I develop stronger trust , because they say these things , because they are a bit concerned , to play against us .
six weeks ago , they did not think of us when it went round the Big games .
Bell@@ avista also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ sters have achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against C@@ ow@@ boys .
the game of Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game but is that a thr@@ illing game ?
or are breaks and do not take some points of tension ?
it &apos;s the blu@@ epr@@ ints for me .
when it mention us , it means that we are still going to meet in a phase .
the Storm team is open to this weekend , since they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begins starting tomorrow .
Serbia with 200,000 $ security deposit to drug ad@@ age
a man , who may have a li@@ fel@@ ong sentence due to his consumption , which have been owned by 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine that have been re@@ compens@@ ated to Que@@ ens@@ land , has been released on a damage deposit of $ 200,000 .
Marko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the military police reached 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America to V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and placed in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he did his co @-@ accused in the mor@@ ay during the mor@@ nings and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police hit 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a possibly li@@ fel@@ ong sentence for the attempt to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ed the advoc@@ ate of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , argu@@ ed that he was unable to possess the entire amount and could have been in a café in a harm@@ less reason .
the judge of the Supreme Court of Peter Flanders , was concerned about the ur@@ king because of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relationships with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he explained the Court on Wednesday .
in the case of a pen@@ al matter , he was lied to the police on its position .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ics mother and his father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security offered jointly to reach his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the encour@@ aging statements of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Richter Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the only one will not suff@@ ice to keep him out of it , he war@@ ned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against b@@ ail , under the conditions that he claims his Australian and his Serb Pass within the police daily , and stops at a departure from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

the mass makes it : every two years the car company at the IAA tell their novel@@ ties .
in 2015 primarily on the compact cars were recorded especially for sale , which are currently particularly well sold .
cars from the compact class are currently especially asked : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registrations were accounted for by the Swiss Federal Office ( KBA ) in August alone at this segment .
this is also reflected at the Frankfurt Motor Show ( audience days September 17 - 27 ) .
this year , a lot of new compact models presented between all the fut@@ ur@@ istic concept automobiles and new luxury cars .
one of the largest premier@@ es for the German automobile industry is the Opel Astra that will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in fall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he belongs to the nu@@ cle@@ us of the brand .
that volume model is also well sold , the new Astra is to be much more expensive .
Opel presents a entry below the largest compet@@ itor VW Golf in the direction of which kicks off at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra costs Euro 16 990 .
the Astra boasts a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp are also available , which for the first time also include three @-@ cylinder petrol engines .
unlike its key compet@@ itor VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is just one fifth .
the second variant will follow in the Spring of Com@@ bi , which is also at the IAA .
and what is going on new compact cars next to the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault does the fourth generation of its Astra compet@@ itor in the race .

J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters of Cell are in@@ significant
the Federal Constitutional Court has given a former in@@ mate of the Te@@ gel occupation of Te@@ gel which has been housed in a small cell for months .
because of the injury of their human dig@@ nity , prisoners have generally claim to pay financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
this was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision on Wednesday .
the suffer@@ ers can therefore even be reserved to the judges if they were imprisoned only a few days in the close quarters ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
with this decision , an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe : he was housed in a single cell with approximately five square metres floor area of floor area ; the toilet has been spati@@ ally separated .
after that , the man , who has meanwhile been transferred to the st@@ roll into the open air , was moved to a larger cell .
his term damage due to the un@@ worthy conditions against the Land Berlin failed .
but the Constitutional Court took up the verdict of the Berlin Chamber of Berlin and rejected the case to renew the case .
they viol@@ ated the human dig@@ nity of the man .
chamber decision now decides on the amount of the compensation
even if the period of legal reasons only a few days be@@ ats for the compensation was decisive for the compensation is a uniform verdict , it was called .
otherwise &quot; a con@@ ical des@@ per@@ ation of the personality should be feared . &quot;
the chamber court must now clari@@ fy the amount of money compensation .
the Constitu@@ tions have already strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past already .
so did they not say in April of a prisoner to in@@ dem@@ nity because he was being imprisoned in a prison cell .
human un@@ worth@@ less is a decision of 2011 according to a cell without separate toilet .
furthermore , in addition , in addition , on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court , a det@@ ain@@ ee in a parallel incident in November 2009 , confirmed a de@@ cent placing .
the then pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs was in operation for three months , between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Kar@@ ru@@ in case .
in recent weeks , Berliner Pr@@ isons were also missing in the head@@ lines in recent weeks .
si@@ det@@ ain@@ ees are therefore kept 23 hours including the aggressi@@ vity , even to s@@ ling things , it is said because of the fixed position .
according to the Ministry of Justice , 21 jobs in Te@@ gel was not busy due to young men , 19 to fall in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating the &quot;
immig@@ ration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or is determined to take it .
what comes to Germany ?
according to forecasts from the Federal Foreign Ministry , about 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany this year , according to the testimony of Vi@@ enn@@ anc@@ ell@@ or Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany even has the position to record one million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrates in view of the unusual challenge resolution : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this , and we can do that . &quot;
what comes in Germany , gives the following overview .
in accordance with different forecasts , between 3@@ 50000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Finance ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the Pest@@ el @-@ Institute ) Apartments - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it is built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
dramatic is the lack of living room but especially at affordable rental objects : annually , 600@@ 00 @-@ 800@@ 00 social apartments are out of the rental price , and in order to apply for these particularly advant@@ age@@ ous apartments .
Swiss Federal Minister for Research Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) will therefore dou@@ bling its funding from currently 518 million to one billion euros .
too little is that from the point of view of the Pest@@ ula Institute : 80 000 Social apartments have to arise and have to be invested in funding of € 6.4 billion per year .
the scientists and Federal Minister of the Federal State of housing sub@@ mits that there must also be no tax advantages for investments in housing .
according to estimates of the Institute of Labor Market and Professional research , 55 percent of the poultry farmers in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , refugees in Germany are not being asked to help them in order to help them at the introduction , Claudia Walter , Project Manager for Integration and Education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
however , for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial whether they work in Germany .
work is the key for social contacts , for appreci@@ ation in the admission application , but also for the self @-@ est@@ e@@ em of the immig@@ rant , a migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
according to the Thr@@ issu@@ ance , Germany has given a political shift in Germany : the prohibition against refugees in recognition of labour .
while previously there was a ban on asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the resi@@ den@@ ces , the asylum seek@@ ers to a residential site .
in society - also because of the professionals , in fact , the Vis@@ i@@ potenti@@ als of Europe - in fact that refugees have to be able to have access to the labour market .
there are still missing German hur@@ dle in access to the labour market .
so far there is no sufficient offer of universal and professional language courses .
research will also show that jobs are most frequently due to personal contact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the structure of networks is therefore , according to the view from Thr@@ än@@ hardt at the König@@ s@@ weg &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Berlin school administration found that only a few fle@@ dged parents give their children into the Kit@@ as , estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the ro@@ oting parents , it is only once again to hold the family , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ ek@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate department .
in order to convince the family from the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration is distributed in various languages .
if the demand for instru@@ ctors increased strongly by the big number of refugees , the Berlin Senate will try to increase its training capacity by roughly , taking more specialized schools .
students without knowledge in welcome groups are prepared for lessons in the countries .
but they are not always taught by all educ@@ ated teachers and teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers , who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no lack , Be@@ ate Ri@@ ches from Berlin &apos;s school administration .
the German student is estimated that 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study in Germany .
prin@@ cip@@ ally , no Bundes@@ land prohibited or sign@@ alled the study - the only exception to now Berlin , the Interior Minister Frank Henkel ( CDU ) have now abandoned its position now .
data consent could facilitate the access to the university .
for refugees with a dwelling place or Dul@@ ce do not receive any services according to the asylum seek@@ er Act more if they start a study .
the latter is generally not an B@@ af@@ ö@@ g because they are not fall under the number of eligible persons .
Ged@@ ul@@ fed refugees had to have lived for four years in Germany to have been eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g @-@ entitled , from 1 January 2016 , these sp@@ anne was shortened to 15 months .
however , this financing must also be closed , seeking for Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin@@ s State Secretary for Science , and the German student union .
the students should immediately receive B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will continue to play a major role in future , because many refugees are Muslims , and for many are the religion important part of their identity .
the state should be succ@@ essi@@ vely succ@@ essi@@ vely the same rights as they have churches , and the existing state @-@ churches right to develop a new state of religi@@ ons .
it is also important to have the establishment of a islam@@ ic welfare state , which is profession@@ ally taking care of the new@@ com@@ ers .
the rights also belong .
so , the representatives of Islam have to be clear at some and ready to move together with the state in many areas and to meet him certain control possibilities .
this also belongs to the will@@ ing@@ ness to relate to religious fundament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed the concern and religious conflicts could also be registered after Germany .
those who wanted to have those conflicts in Germany have immediate right to stay here , in Germany , in Germany , he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
he proposed to translate the Basic Law on Arab .
integration will continue to be much more than today a topic of society .
in this way , the majority society reserves have to change the exploitation of discrimination and rac@@ ism .
indeed , Germany - as a result of European decisions - a gap of anti @-@ discrimination based on a non @-@ discrimination law and a General Gender Equality Act .
but it is very slow to show how the NSU @-@ M@@ ord@@ table shows that the police and authorities were systematically igno@@ red by the police and authorities .
equal opportunities for all : what mig@@ u@@ res@@ organizations and stak@@ eholders not already call for a long request to immig@@ ration to Germany , must become reality in the next few years , if the country will remain peaceful and citizens want to ut@@ ili@@ ze their possibilities - to the benefit of all .
in Germany , Germany had been able to supply medical care until now , the doctors of the medical doctor Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery .
&quot; what concerns maneu@@ ver power and capacities , we create the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told the Tages@@ spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mirror . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however extra money must flow into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ess , Mont@@ gom@@ ery tells us to be able to discharge all the call of health at the registration of healthcare .
the services could be completed later with the federal states .
and in the long term , it is highly un@@ questi@@ onable , so many people see the limited power catalogue , which see the asylum seek@@ er law .
otherwise they will make the physi@@ cians particularly to create the language barri@@ ers .
already until now , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has been demonstrated , migrants are po@@ or@@ ted with their disease than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in physician &apos;s medical practices required interpre@@ ting costs , it calls for them .
many refugees have been helping people with more common medical points in the emergency @-@ related situations .
and with a other diagnostic sight .
there are much more disp@@ uted among young refugees , and in the yo@@ ungst@@ ers it go about HIV @-@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment .
the Mont@@ gom@@ ery - with the partly other diseases resulting from her education , Mont@@ gom@@ ery tells us .
&quot; paras@@ ite attacks or tuber@@ culosis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; and in terms of the doctors , it is maybe even relief in sight with the refugees .
the Syrians had a highly developed education system , some refugees , even doctors .
in order to be pract@@ ised , however , they would have to prove their qualification and bl@@ ur@@ ly once again .
at least half of the refugees arrive in Germany is ill after estimates by the Federal psycho@@ therapeu@@ tics ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) psych@@ ically ill : most suffer from post @-@ trau@@ matic holes or under depression .
in particular , refugee &apos;s children suffer , says Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ Pt@@ K .
a recent study conducted by the TU Munich is that every fifth Syrian refugee community put in use in Germany .
who is ill in a post @-@ trau@@ matic level of stress , is suffering from the so @-@ called Flash@@ back with breathing , di@@ zz@@ iness , cardi@@ ac ab@@ ases and death .
other symptoms are dor@@ m and concentration disorders , strong scre@@ ech@@ ism and emotional divers .
in order to prevent the symptoms of chronic , an early treatment would be required , Mun@@ z declared .
so far , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees have had an psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ically ill asylum seek@@ ers can present a request for psycho@@ therapy , however , the treatment usually takes several months .
Moreover , in the social offices , most of the facts or doctors , who are not trained for mental illness , would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often lead to false ass@@ ess@@ ments , saith Mun@@ z .

Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst will also take this position : &quot; if it is not good for our animals , it is not good for us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents are enjoying every string of matches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quad@@ ratic gent@@ lem@@ an &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they will be called loving , is read after the possibility of every wish from the eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mug@@ abe keep@@ eth false speech in parliament
M@@ R Mug@@ abe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of Falls spread rapidly through the social media .
the opening of the Parliament also passed by alleg@@ ations of M@@ EP@@ s in the opposition that they had been war@@ ned of anonymous deaths and war@@ ned that they have been war@@ ned of Mr Mug@@ abe by Mr Mug@@ abe and had been war@@ ned .
last month , they had hat@@ tered him and held him in his speech to the State of the Nation in parliament - this is the question he repeated on Tuesday .
the speaker of the Movement for Democratic Shift ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven Opp@@ os@@ itions politicians have received SMS messages on their phones which they prov@@ oked to inter@@ fer@@ es Mr. Mug@@ ab@@ dic@@ ated .

Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard becomes up to 30.000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 work@@ places within the framework of restructuring and saving efforts .
today , HP will share in two listed companies this year and separate their computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service activities .
the expected job of job will lead to a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP announced in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this restructuring measures are a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chair@@ woman and Chief Executive Officer who led the unity after the separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and stronger than it is HP today , and we have a broad and deep@@ est portfolio of shops that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company we are better than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than € 50 billion of revenues and &quot; is to be focused on the provision of an integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; such an explanation of the company .
it divi@@ des a company which was founded in the 1930s by the al@@ um@@ ni of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Fischer to manufacture electric plants and has called the Palo Alto Garage , &quot; the birth@@ place of Sil@@ icon Valley . &quot;
HP has under@@ gone a massive re@@ structure to handle the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech company , is the latest in this area that is based on the convic@@ tion that closely focused on a better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team mates have to stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
W@@ enger stressed from Wil@@ sh@@ ere , that it is only September and if his rehabilitation after plan runs , there is no reason why he is not able to play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere certainly miss out at least the next four games to be missed and in view of its history is certainly not un@@ certain in the coming summer .
the great dis@@ grace of this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere ended up the last season after a separate Kn@@ u@@ ck@@ el@@ iction whole and then returned to its old swing during the pre@@ season .
&quot; this type of violation is not threatened with career , &quot; said W@@ enger .
there is a bone that healed not well .
this is no longer matter .
that was just an accident .
it wasn &apos;t in connection with its Kn@@ u@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries that he had before .
this may be true from pure medical point of view , but as W@@ enger also recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it develops an un@@ pleasant pattern .
the survey conducted by Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has 23 different ill@@ nesses of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Ar@@ sen@@ a 157 League games in the last five seasons .
the wider image for ar@@ senal is that they were in six out of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 , one of the two Premier League Clubs who have recorded most vulner@@ able days .
W@@ enger accepts the potential of an Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ ide but Arsenal believes that an improvement in danger of injuries is ongoing during last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , if you return an injury , you have a vulner@@ able time period , in which you need to strengthen your body and win battle @-@ force , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope that his body stabil@@ izes , I am confident that he will do it and he will perform a career of the way he deserv@@ ed .
Arsenal begin his Champions League @-@ season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb front of the games against Chelsea du Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham hot@@ track in next Wednesday , and W@@ enger is a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ieu Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta do not launch .
W@@ enger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of late Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep balance and the players who need it to give a little break off , &quot; said W@@ enger .
though Arsenal are clear favour@@ ites , through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the game positions with the largest slot effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games , after the &quot; un@@ defeated &quot; campaign started in the last season .
the stadium was struck on Tuesday evening by an earthquake , whereby on the Richter scale was measured 3.2 .
this year , it was the 10th place in Zagreb .
W@@ enger is in mind that Arsenal had drawn the lesson from last season with the Champions League Cup surrender to Monaco and remains committed from far hope to lead the association to his first European Parliament triumph .
&quot; this drive is immen@@ sely , &quot; said W@@ enger .
it has never worked for ar@@ senal .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in the shop to be realistic .

friendship Day : the com@@ edy show that gives us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious if the need for men to open themselves , now more des@@ per@@ ate than ever before , like self @-@ murder in younger men on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high .
in 2013 , it was the main cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and remained more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campaign Against Living is propos@@ ing ( CA@@ LM - campaign against a her@@ n@@ ty life ) in 2015 , with the aim of presenting culture in question , causing men to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the fight to master this challenge .
a recent study at more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with de@@ pres@@ sive symptoms show that when the out@@ going a suff@@ ici@@ ently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; its chances of recovery are doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , hal@@ ved a circle of intellectual healthy friends the risks of mental problems .
but of course one must first have friends to work for a friendship .
in the age of social media , communication with its main focus on substance is the in@@ fertil@@ ity of the response often more important than an important contact .
our digital life have the need , powerful , fun and successful , doubles , even if in reality the isolation is dominated .
this su@@ perf@@ icial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists will ex@@ tr@@ an values . money , image , social status , everything related to cost in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner vision is searching for personal development and friendship which affects our mental health much deeper .
and how a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire explained in recent , happiness can really not buy .
the beauty for friends was that this focusing on the head was put on .
each character has not been defined by his work but defined by his personality who sh@@ one through the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ or of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler Frequ@@ ent U@@ mar@@ es , Mom@@ ents in football gu@@ st@@ ons in cozy bo@@ ilers and the lon@@ ging of Ross to Rachel - All this came from the knowledge that men can refer to any case , even if they are often back to explore completely their feelings .
how a staff of telephone pro@@ vision@@ ing said to me : ... &quot; my audi@@ ences aimed at de@@ pres@@ sive and self @-@ end@@ anger@@ ed , has really shown me how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us are often not able to talk with friends .
the old Rede@@ emer &quot; I see thus quite righ@@ tly &quot; has an enormous effect , such as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness , if you speak of problems . &quot;
it is one of the shows that arises from me in the sense when trying to offer long @-@ term secondary employment mechanisms .
this clearly presents the little moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so very close my objective city status via phone numbers may also help people in eye views of desp@@ air , while long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you come to this weekend of com@@ edy Central Friend@@ ship with the celebration of the day completely redesigned back@@ drop , why don &apos;t take your friends to drink at a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you alone saw in Star@@ bu@@ cks anyone alone , give it a smile or tell him hello .
one never know what difference could make your friendship .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning - the entire 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Mary meets , to help PS@@ G to grin@@ d Malmö
angel Di Maria is celebrating with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit on Malmö .
di Mary meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass to Malmö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani maintained a course when Paris Saint @-@ Germain claimed his Champions League Season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory over Malmö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met fewer than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G players who brought the french masters on the road , but afterwards , they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their advantage , as Cav@@ ani achieved a head ball@@ room for the 6@@ 1st minute .
with FC Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in the group A needed a strong start to the Swedish master , since they are not only qualifying for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ laps , but an improvement on the way to the quarter final in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a classic game by Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an Ibra@@ him@@ ov &apos;s chances ahead of the goal . he later became in game against his home town team and against the club , with which he began his lively career back in 1999 .
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or in@@ ward to the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win , even when there are certain things we have had to reply in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; that is a good mark .
we wanted to win and we won , though I unfortunately regre@@ t that we didn &apos;t have any more or two more goals . &quot;
Ibra@@ him@@ ovic returned to Paris after his injury to the Paris team that was able to hold a 2 : 2 un@@ decided on his place against Bordeaux in the first league , but he was cast out by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argentin@@ ian wing stage was called the man who was taking over the next level in Europe when it was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and it pointed out why when he ran in Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ is Pass behind the Malmö defense before becoming a beautiful corner of the network .
if anyone believed that PS@@ G would get a great victory , that was disappointed .
Malmö , the Cel@@ tic in a Play @-@ off , struck the stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and compet@@ ed with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field called a serious opponents .
but besides a shot by Nikola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who settled well to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ rist@@ s in the 34@@ th minute , they feel little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself had sometimes applied , with some patches with flaws and poor finish , not least was g@@ him@@ him@@ ovic , who was first pat@@ ched in the first half alone and then abandoned after the re@@ boot of Cav@@ ani .
despite this , he proved much more skill if he had brought his players into the game , and it was a pass by Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , who was named T@@ fo@@ xes at the P@@ rist@@ les from Wil@@ land in the 5@@ 2nd minute ...
the second gate was finally fell short after the series of Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans took the sixth back of the season , after which him@@ ovic had caught a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all the thoughts that Malmö reach the game , and only an excellent input from Wil@@ t from shortest distance to David Lu@@ iz , could not keep the final result before the replacement player E@@ ze@@ qui@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi has been recognized by the end .
the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later announced that PS@@ G played a class about his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last December last year .
since then we played only in the Swedish League , which did not have the same level .
the qualifying games are not enough . &quot;
hat off before Paris !
it was a great game of them !

world and European Champion X@@ avi is playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern obviously lack@@ ed some years prior to the commitment of Spain by Super@@ star X@@ avi , who played at that time for FC Barcelona .
eight time Spanish champion , three times winner , four times Champions League winner , two time club champion , two time European champion , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; never wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the reminder : in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi not moved

matt Dam@@ on plays a variety in film production
matt Dam@@ on faced the af@@ ro@@ amer@@ ican film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown in a discussion about the diversity and said it will not be behind the scenes .
during a episode of Sunday Night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown who stressed the need for alternative perspectives stated in terms of a black prot@@ agon@@ ists in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; when we speak about variety , then you do in the occupation of the film and not at the occupation of the show , &quot; assured Dam@@ on .
Brown responded to a sho@@ cked un@@ belief , and called &quot; HO@@ O ! Wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor &apos;s play was strengthened by The Mar@@ ti@@ an .
Dam@@ on and Brown included the production of Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I would like to think people who will think about it - who will always be the director , as they will handle the figure of the Harmony , &quot; said Brown first .
the only black person , and it is a no@@ de that is beaten up by a white b@@ older .
the producer of the White People has set up for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for direc@@ ting rights to the film ; Dam@@ on said that their director could something &quot; at the end , what we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the debate has been broadcast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded over Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni pressed his rage over the clip by saying &quot; Matt Dam@@ on &quot; talks about the only black person in the room , so it can tell her diversity - that is SO WE@@ ISS that it hurt you . &quot;
the twe@@ et served more than 5,000 Saviour and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its publication .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments are at a time on the more accurate representation of representation in the media at the top of social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ emen , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter &apos;s Movement and Pe@@ oples Republic posted discri@@ min@@ ating practices against color @-@ content .
in February , the singer Prince gives a lap@@ se to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; album quiet@@ ly matter , &quot; ( albums are still their significance ) he said .
like books and black life , albums are still their significance .
more recently , the Black Li@@ ves &apos; movement have published a declaration in response to the question of Fox News character Elisabeth H@@ assel@@ beck , whether the group should be considered a hat@@ red group .
&quot; the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter network is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ ards , who are invited to visit the Pope who discuss the representation of the Catholic church in the West .
whether he received the invitation , or has already received the Pope , is un@@ clear .

professional sport clim@@ atic by Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero raises the first Ath@@ let , who won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and won the Grand Prix of $ 1 Million .
the contest , which had just completed her 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who managed to close all stages of his obst@@ acle course .
during the season , there were two men , cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten to the final .
the climbing wall belonged to a 75 foot climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time when he finished the first Ath@@ let , who finished the str@@ en@@ uous phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full of three seconds faster than the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero said with E ! news after the hard fought win , still under the shock above the winning of the Grand Prix of 1 Million Dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than $ 10,000 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Isaac E said ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said about his he@@ ap . &quot; &quot; &quot;
suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed joined the Hollywood repor@@ ter to discuss the finals and why Britain , even though he first ended the tour at all , not any prize money .
after the rules , the money passes the quick@@ est person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there &apos;s more than one fin@@ alists , the one gets at the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much the money is a wonderful price and changed life , he gets the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think that he swe@@ eps up about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he did .
at the crow@@ ds of awards he received from fans .
he is so a great guy and a family man .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be defeated by someone , then am I glad , that it is Isaac . &quot;
and I think that Isaac would have felt equally , if they had been mixed up the roles .
America Ninja Warrior was extended for a mixed season , the shooting will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers return on Minnesota Twin@@ s
MIN@@ NE@@ ING L@@ IS@@ --@@ the second half of the season was not especially funny for the Detroit tiger .
once they were one of the best teams competing in bas@@ eball . today the tiger &apos;s last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to its role as Sp@@ o@@ iler , but this part performed perfectly against Minnesota Twin@@ s with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field .
the Twin@@ s gave a chance to climb into a game of Houston , Houston , for the second American League of Wild@@ card @-@ Platz .
for Detroit , even though only for an evening , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word , which was so difficult for a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad educ@@ ator .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon held up his early offensive support , where Detroit lost three times in the first two ings , then once in the sixth and then once in ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 inside and made three install@@ ments for us .
it was just his third successful start in his final nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year strongly , &quot; said Simon .
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bul@@ lets of each game , and therefore I want to navigate into the game .
the designated tiger H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two inst@@ alls , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit @-@ hit by Mart@@ ine@@ z when he had four hits against the Seattle marin@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; he has be@@ vi@@ ed the b@@ lows well , &quot; he said .
he looked good at the ( punch bag ) , clearly looked much better from the bul@@ l@@ do@@ ers , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three cents at the rear of the seventh floor , the Twin@@ s had their best chance to come back in the game .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
Right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks achieved a bun@@ ch , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the Bla@@ ine Hard@@ y &apos;s left hand .
Hard@@ y passed on Wall , the only man with whom he was faced , before the designated ro@@ ok@@ ie b@@ ats@@ man Miguel S@@ ano , who took a Two @-@ Run on the right hand of Dre@@ w Ver@@ h@@ agen .
with a pair of runners and the conclusion @-@ run in the second , Ver@@ h@@ agen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe at a Double Play .
it was the Major League &apos;s leading 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe hit the Double Play ?
after Detroit lost an Insurance Run on the end of the 9th inside , there was a R@@ B@@ I double against the C@@ loser of Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored 5 @-@ 4 .
but the right wa@@ ist@@ band stand for S@@ ano with three Pit@@ ches for the fifth one .
Detroit benef@@ ited from the beginning of the game by another Phil Hug@@ hes .
the tig@@ ers achieved three grooves in the first two inner @-@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , which was eliminated from the injuries in front of the injuries for more than one month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hug@@ hes , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said I feel better when I started to release and felt some good Pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after winning the Le@@ ad@@ off bat@@ ter in the first step , H@@ ush@@ es delivered a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ vest@@ re .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z gave Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game played a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 successful series with the top in the sc@@ oring position .
the third B@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos was followed by a single at the right @-@ hand side , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game as he tried to enter into the third party , which ended the threat .
the tiger &apos;s set in the second , generated one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center F@@ iel@@ t Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a great blow , &quot; said Twin@@ s Manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he did not sm@@ ite them especially well , but he has caught the right spot .
Hug@@ hes has been kept in a pitch @-@ Count , and didn &apos;t record any points in the third inning , before he was replaced by the Reli@@ able Cab@@ inet A.@@ J.@@ A@@ yer .
Hug@@ hes made up three rounds with six hits and a walk with four strips .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP An@@ i@@ bal San@@ chez provided for a breach of the wr@@ oth .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the shoulder of San@@ chez in 2007 .
San@@ chez , since the middle of August , on the injuries list due to a shoulder @-@ distortion , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ chez from the game , L@@ HP was filmed by the risk of the injuries to start the Twin@@ s .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the tig@@ ers , since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he ste@@ am@@ us since 20 August because of a disin@@ teg@@ ration in the right th@@ igh .

Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria
the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that they may not take place on military service options without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he designed the European states &quot; collective ways &quot; .
four years ago we had been glad that the cup was prec@@ eded by a military participation in Germany .

specific numbers were not called her and rejected talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees came across the so @-@ called Bal@@ kan@@ route from Hungary to Austria .
your destination is mostly Germany .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) and their Austrian colleague Werner Fay@@ mann , together with several other EU leaders , deployed a special summit to the next week .
Germany started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU states have not yet held a common approach into the crisis until now .
the EU Minister of Interior plans to take a new attack on Tuesday ( 22nd September ) with a special upgrade to the binding distribution of more than 120 000 refugees .
given the strong refugee community in Germany , federal government plans to support the Länder for the first time and distribution of people .
the federal government will conduct this in cooperation with the countries in collaboration with the President of the Federal Chancell@@ ery in Berlin , with the President of the Federal Chancell@@ ery in Berlin .
Merkel must under@@ score those people who need to protect the protection .
but he who have no lead perspective could not remain in Germany .
this idea was divided into the round .
the Chancellor , emphas@@ ized , the state as a whole , must now move a &quot; huge power of power . &quot;
in the meantime , thousands of des@@ per@@ ate refugees have arrived on the Balk@@ ans .

the Romanian government condem@@ ns the plan immediately .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .

no diet fruit - Mang@@ os contain plenty of sugar
Mang@@ os are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but those who want to pay on his sl@@ ender line will often take off from them often .
because Mang@@ os contain relatively much sug@@ ars - mainly Sac@@ char@@ ose .
the exotic fruit is nevertheless healthy : in them B vitamins and vitamins E and C. mainly contain man@@ gan@@ s but plenty of vitamin A and its pre @-@ stage beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ in .

at the next night , in the pe@@ eling at the Alp@@ enn@@ ese side of the fo@@ ster , hair dryer was closed on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and at night on Thursday the hair @-@ hair falls partly with tor@@ ch thickness through the F@@ ill .
following a conc@@ ili@@ ent on Thursday morning , a distinctive cold front that brings strong rainfall , winds and a temperature down@@ fall .
like Met@@ e@@ o@@ News in a communication , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive interval @-@ pres@@ sur@@ ized over the British islands in a powerful outer territory .
on the side@@ board side , at night , hair dryer was replaced by the valleys .
in the consequence , the hair dryer until morning of tomorrow can be combined with ar@@ ches from 60 to 100 km / h , and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land , partly also with over 100 km / h .

Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome .
in the presence of the City of Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino has been christ@@ ened a fabulous place in the park at the Opp@@ io Hill on the name of the German reform@@ ists .
on the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now recognized as &quot; German The@@ ologist of the Reformation . &quot;
the park lies right in the middle of Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the name was originally applied by the work of the Protestant Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , priest of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome , rec@@ alled the Wednesday that Protest@@ ants were often allowed to live as a minority in the city of the Pop@@ es on centuries .
the square is visible in the symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) took up a young August@@ ine fri@@ ars at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he received the city at that time as a promise of sin .
his negative impressions had occurred on him in his later battle against Rome in his later battle .
in 1969 , Luther was re@@ directed with his thes@@ es against the destruction of the Austrian church .
Hammer artists invested three years in personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus ( gold @-@ plated ) Dor@@ n@@ enk@@ rone is one of the principal works that have painted Ot@@ ter alto for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost is writing the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ ter @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now been published with magnificent paintings .
in the beginning it was the image for Ot@@ ter Alt , who formul@@ ates his own personal interpretation of biblical stories on paper and canvas at the beginning .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but by no means it is syn@@ onymous with &quot; fun &quot; pictures .
on the contrary : the particular topics can be adjusted , the quite righ@@ tw@@ ist works .
for about three years , Ot@@ ten@@ alto has worked on his holy project for which he has met a sub@@ jective and artistic selection from the many topics of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
the cycles produced in topics such as cross @-@ section , pl@@ agues , commandments , or pat@@ ern@@ ity , were developed .
it is therefore spont@@ ane@@ ously rounded to several partners : this is true of the Luther Verlag with its the@@ ological alignment as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its main focus on art books .
and that is mainly the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who conf@@ essed his painting with the respective Bible verses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is interpreted by the Ot@@ ter Alt selected Bible places and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; translated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at present in current gathering . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are as the verb@@ al view of Al@@ ts painting .
it is nestled between the original Bible tradition of Martin Luther and one of the artist , who formulated its very personal thoughts on the situation here .
the jewelry cord hath golden liz@@ ards .
so the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
that is a high degree of in@@ tim@@ acy .
emotions were finally found out for the Bible project : Ot@@ ter Alt , born in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ er@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protestant ruler of the Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the up@@ bringing went through the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is remin@@ is@@ cent of Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work for me to bear me again with the Lord Father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second suit was to save the art in faster times more opportunities : &quot; the perception of im@@ pass@@ words is influenced by a Rek@@ l@@ ame , and this is no@@ isy .
symbol@@ ism is then ou@@ sted .
artists have a different desire and desire to show things .
have always something hidden and are not decorative .
&quot; in this regard I am a din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
Ot@@ ter Alt wants to leave the viewer in the pictures &quot; to let them work , discover and feel that force they have : &quot; the image is looking for its face about . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost rose on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar alto @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ ter @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Kunst : &quot; I like he under@@ stands with his pictures . &quot;
old I have not considered to complete the Bible , but also chose the major , also mysterious topics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was no co @-@ operation at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text is explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an explanation of an image . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life to deep@@ en and freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Images speak for M@@ öh@@ ler &apos;s ( biblical ) Language of Love as well as the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and cloth images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be inaugurated on 15 November at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
start of construction for BM@@ X train
plans were made , place found , companies asked for a circuit model : one year later almost everything was finished - but still before the official opening of the BM@@ X train was finished .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this year has even happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

DF@@ B intensive commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees from 2019 until 2019 , and the Bundesliga is a clear sign at the weekend .
the S@@ occ@@ er respon@@ ds to the combined situation in Germany and sec@@ ures the policy of aid to help of the pending problems .
&quot; I have been holding this for the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can tell nobody else , that &apos;s nothing , but I have nothing to do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be interested in every one of them that cra@@ ving the grip in the handle , &quot; said DF@@ B @-@ chief Wolfgang R@@ s@@ bach .
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September , he wants to intensi@@ vely enhance the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; I am the next Wednesday in the Chancellor and meet the State Minister for Women Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ uz and the Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be a key role for sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football can be and wanted to help .
the decisive turn@@ outs must however place the policy .
therefore , the German Football Association has therefore expanded its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; four years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we made sure that this program continues to pass through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Stiftung , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ren@@ s@@ bach explained on the edge of the UEFA &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Julian &apos;s / Malta &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also some german comments support this program .
this weekend the 36 pro@@ s constitute a clear sign when it &apos;s on the left side @-@ ring instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logos ( Hermes ) help &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to do so clearly that all of them should help , wherever and how they can only , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen , Sport@@ head Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Tuesday ) and called the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ sensitivity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama is everyone that no one can see . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can say , no , we have to ut@@ ili@@ ze our radi@@ ance , our influence and our possibilities to help many refugees who have already so incredible experience , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoff@@ enh@@ ei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent characters of the League . &quot;
on Friday quali@@ fier against Hungary on this Friday the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Saale .
Nier@@ s@@ bach called the support of refugees as &quot; a large common German football . &quot;
that all 36 licensed companies would have launched its own projects in their own sites .
the equally great is that small and smallest dec@@ ei@@ vers are active .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; which we spent , will live in the football .
&quot; that is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
in this and next year , the association is making 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government .
&quot; the clubs have already called the whole sum of 2015 , &quot; ren@@ der@@ bach reported .

football : Bv@@ B without re@@ us against Kras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund all hopes raised in a com@@ eback to the com@@ eback of Europe League Final in the first group of the Europe League .
the national player is also missing with the table leader of the football @-@ Bundesliga in du@@ el with the F@@ RP Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 / Sky ) .
&quot; we cannot attack him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether Re@@ us will be on Sunday in the Bundesliga match against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the Bv@@ B Coach is open : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the face of the high load of his professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its ancest@@ ral position on the Re@@ us position .
so he would have a change on the door@@ ke@@ over position .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller receives the place of art@@ ender Roman decor@@ ki .
&quot; he trained on an absolute top level , &quot; lob@@ b@@ ying the world champion &apos;s world champion .
if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is going into operation in all Europe League games , Tu@@ ch@@ el didn &apos;t let it open .
with high probability he will also contest the second game .
the joint statement of Mit@@ z@@ us Re@@ us that the Fin@@ al@@ way for the Bv@@ B in the Europa League emphas@@ ises the goal , keeps the mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l keeps for downstream users : &quot; therefore Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; I think we have a good chance to re@@ access the title . &quot;
Ro@@ bot &apos;s cars : government wants to fight for Germany
according to the will of the Federal Government of Germany , it is supposed to be the government of the cars of technological pron@@ unci@@ ation .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the house of the Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which provides investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the mar@@ gins of the mar@@ ital IAA of a &quot; new Mobil@@ ization Age . &quot;
the automated and connected driving will increase the traffic safety and cause less stress , Do@@ brin@@ is said .
he is also aiming to discuss the subject with his counter@@ part , the G7 states that also joined representatives of the industry .
the strategy &apos;s strategic partnership , among other things , emphas@@ ises the importance of the mobile broad@@ band expansion and a high @-@ depth conversion to digital radio .
the testing new technology is currently being constructed on highway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with this driver , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional adh@@ esion risks will be br@@ ushed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wants to review the legal conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to verify the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Germany , Germany wants to design@@ ate the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h .
the Federal Government also wants to apply to a modification of the Vienna Convention , which has previously planned only for passengers as a driver .
when automated driving takes over the car , the driver will take the guide , the driver will be more and more to the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that process the environment and process the data in seconds .
according to a study made by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , automated driving to motor@@ ways will be technically possible by 2020 .
even more @-@ less vehicles on public roads are expected to be expected only until 2020 . &quot;
the value added in the driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the Germany location will estimate the authors of the study at around 8.4 billion euros by 2025 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the cars can lead to traffic and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD traffic @-@ sensitive S@@ ör@@ en Bart@@ ol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the issue of liability for accidents and the safety of the personal data of the driver must be clari@@ fied .
however , the Germans are still more sk@@ ep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
one on Wednesday at the AA set of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the Testing Agency DE@@ K@@ RA comes to the outcome , that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous vehicles will be en@@ forced during the next ten years , 32 percent are not reck@@ oned in 20 years , 31 percent believe it at all .
in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents agreed by 2025 with autonomous vehicles , 33 percent in the USA .
nonetheless , the drivers in Germany are not willing to leave the car completely on a self @-@ driving vehicle .
following a collection of the B@@ IT@@ KO@@ M digital association , only seven percent would agree to control the control throughout the roads .
on the motorway the turn@@ around traffic could already be 15 percent , while St@@ au is 45 percent .
good every V@@ ised would leave the car under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
at the actual level of the event , Düssel@@ dor@@ fer wants to fight until October 25 through October 4 only in singles .

&quot; that is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the guys experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough , even without Timo the title , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said German trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ head during the EM course in Düsseldorf &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ oll has been at this point on the flight to a long @-@ term civil sponsor@@ ship in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German Masters is expected to be back on Friday .
&quot; without Timo , the dis@@ advantage , we are no longer a clear favorite , &quot; explained single European champion Dim@@ it@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov .
Ham@@ el@@ ner , who heads the setting list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also remin@@ ded the upcoming 2013 in Schwe@@ chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Timo also missed , and we are European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should teach us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the World Ranking 2013 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gaul@@ tier feels to be old for a enf@@ ant
it is a mixture of very large fashion show and a wax figures . Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : pallet man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , look in@@ able thanks to video proj@@ ections .
they contribute the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designer , which was created with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits to the big star of the fashion scene - and that he put men in coats .
&quot; I can &apos;t say today that I am the enf@@ ant in the Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; previously , it was easy , meanwhile , it &apos;s real , &quot; said Gaul@@ tier .
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is seen from September 18 to the Kunsth@@ alle of Hyp@@ o @-@ Cultural Foundation , it is a good fortune that the Mod@@ eller ator has changed his first person over his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually , he was on the other hand , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me there was a bit of death for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you &apos;ll get into the museum .
the impressive collection had previously made in Montreal , Montreal and Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said he &apos;s director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren .
it go to tolerance , acceptance and vision of open society .
the exhibits give an insight into that &apos;s barely visible work of the man who has written fashion history without ever completing training .
chron@@ ologically the look is not built , but it &apos;s an excellent as chore@@ ograph@@ ed plastic artwork , used for much effort : to autom@@ ate the pupp@@ ets , for example , a styl@@ ist is engaged .
14 tons of material used the makers according to the Cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special shame : a leather watch@@ man out@@ fit with Kor@@ s@@ ett .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
he always interested in heavy women ( &quot; women are case of men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , said Gaul@@ tier .
the Gaul@@ t@@ ers old Teddy is also shown in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , swe@@ eping thing sc@@ iss@@ ors of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good school and bad@@ ly in football ) he did his Teddy B@@ HS and dresses , he said Gaul@@ tier .
with a doll to play , his parents could not have allowed him .
the dis@@ card of fashion then changed it later .
he st@@ ole the fashion magazine and saw the designs of other designers related to the Gaul@@ tier in Munich .
I then bought it later .
for his first own fashion show , he didn &apos;t have to pay the models .
they got nothing but were allowed to keep the cl@@ amp@@ ons .
jewelry instead of Gard@@ ine - Pl@@ au@@ ener top as fashion niche
previously , it went to the long embroi@@ der@@ y engines in and around pl@@ under@@ ed to make feet .
the embroi@@ dered materials and tips were produced in large quantities of customers that for example they worked for ceilings and curtains .
today the alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the Mo@@ vies plate .
instead the fashion is important again .
in the early hours of the Pl@@ au@@ ener , fashion played a major role , then pl@@ ur@@ ged into the home textiles industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt announces some examples : top of jew@@ ellery , accessories such as pockets and for regional tra@@ ps .
the so @-@ called vintage @-@ mode , which re@@ jects the past styles , is an increase in the potential .
anyone who serves not a niche in the textile industry is no longer available on the market .
we have already made half of all orders with us .
Mo@@ vies Pl@@ auen , along with nine other companies , is a member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener top and embroi@@ der@@ ies .
only they may carry the Prot@@ ected label .
in the last 15 years , some 80 percent of sales are destroyed .
private trade links and also the wholesale outlets are almost no longer .
our products are hardly able to reach our customers in this way .
in the Asian room the mass hardware nowadays become much cheaper in the Asian region , and almost exclusively distributed over chains .
he has also been the export of exports to Russia and the United States .
so , there are plenty of reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to score as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer of the embroi@@ der@@ y in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have made a seal of quality , which shows that we will produce organic and soci@@ ally toler@@ able . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt supplements : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
graduate engineer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the snow@@ man of the West Sax@@ on University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ alizes in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
in order to prevent competition from the Asian room , they need to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
that needs time and courage .
there is a voltage range between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and companies that need to think above all economically , &quot; says Schmidt .
that is why an existing design often varies only slightly , to keep a customer base .

EU wants to double mercury limit value in cat@@ fish
the European Commission intends to double the limit values for mercury in large smo@@ kers and consumers make an significantly higher dose of nerv@@ ous gifts .
the consumer organization F@@ ood@@ sport , which is a promising working paper in the EU , critic@@ ized the plans for industrial and adverse events , with full balance of pregnant and infants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , F@@ ood@@ sport .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the ner@@ ve gi@@ f for large fish at the end of the food chain are projected to be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury @-@ per kilogram of fish .
large space @-@ fish are already so strong with mercury now , that on the basis of the limit values , about 50 percent of the length may not be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.5 percent would be un@@ available .
in return , the EU intends to watch the EU according to F@@ ood@@ sport , the limit values of other fish currently cast 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 mg of mercury per kilogram .
F@@ ood@@ sport , this , however , called &quot; Tri@@ ck , &quot; because smaller peace @-@ fish , such as car@@ p , usually stro@@ ve so low that they already comply with the proposed maximum values today .
the lowering of the wast@@ es is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de de@@ fle@@ ction maneu@@ ver that helps the economy alone , &quot; stated Wolf@@ sch@@ midt .
mercury is a high @-@ high heavy metal that extends over the food chain above all in cat@@ er@@ fish .
the Federal Government thus war@@ ns that &quot; small amounts can cause particularly serious damage to the nerv@@ ous system . &quot;
the Federal Ministry of Environment declares in its homepage with regard to the limits , however that a &quot; health concern was not expected to be expected . &quot;
mercury reaches the environment mainly by the coal combustion .
according to a written document by the Federal Ministry of Environment , Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ ck ordered more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total volume produced in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in f@@ ishes around the Elbe , Rhine and Danube must be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanent and widespread &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted from the paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide war@@ nings about mercury in fish were already reported to be RA@@ S@@ FF as the most widely reported health risks in the EU .
