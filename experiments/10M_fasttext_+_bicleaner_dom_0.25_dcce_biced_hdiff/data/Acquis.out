&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States , Belgium , Denmark , Germany , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) , and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the following reasons - a ) The EEC has decided to contribute to the special action programme specified at the conference for international economic cooperation with low income derived from common res@@ sour@@ cent@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ no problems to meet the immediate needs of individual countries .
C ) It is the purpose of the EEC and the Member States that the whole of the Member States is tied in six months after in@@ power@@ ment of the agreement and as far as possible within two years of entry into form of loans ; and the organization will succeed in order to achieve this goal .
D ) The EEC and the organisation have consul@@ ted about the proposed execution and administration of this agreement and the center bonds to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the scope of this agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this purpose , the EEC has submitted a table to the requirements laid out in which regard they specified in this agreement - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BIS could include stand @-@ by @-@ credit agreements with central banks of credi@@ tors , if banks make an appropriate application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the agreement could be closed up until the total amount of the membership fee paid by the credi@@ tor , and within a total limits of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion invoice units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future reductions in the member countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now , however , some conditions are called , to which application the BI@@ Z would be ready . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with each standby credit , the BIS will first take over a commitment for two years , whereby the possibility of renew@@ als will be exceeded , without having to be five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the drawing would take place in the currencies of the currencies available at the end of the BIS , which would likely extend into US dollars , while taking into account the means of the bank are expected to take three or six months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conditions would correspond to those participating in which the BIS must be applied to the respective conditions at similar conditions , i.e. the interest rate would largely correspond to the market rates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the BIS has to pro@@ cure the necessary means even on the market , the rate of interest rate could reach a maximum due to the Libor given to the Libor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be thank@@ ful if you would like to tell me the consent of the Council of the European Communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BIS could include stand @-@ by @-@ credit agreements with central banks of credi@@ tors , if banks make an appropriate application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand on the trade with H@@ amm@@ el - the Lamb and Go@@ ds
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I recall the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations concerning the import@@ ation of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goats from New Zealand in connection with the application of the regulation concerning a common market organisation for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recognition of the fact that the sheep &apos;s economy and the export of H@@ amm@@ el - and lamb is not affected after the world market and especially after the community for the New Zealand economy , I will not inter@@ f@@ ere with the following agreement : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , New Zealand comm@@ its itself to ensure that the set amount of the set amount does not exceed the set amount . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fixed quantities are executed in common offer ( frozen or cooled ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community guarantees that New Zealand should not be prevented from entering new technological developments , or maintain its competitive position on the market of the community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should a change in the offer form due to changes in technology and retailers , the two contra@@ cting parties consult each other prior to the introduction of such a change in clause 10 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event that the community takes care of guar@@ dian , it is oblig@@ ated to protect themselves from this agreement to preserve New Zealand &apos;s interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of the case that imports from New Zealand exceed the agreed quantities , the community reserves the right to susp@@ end from this country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

any contract party may termin@@ ate this agreement with regard to the term of one year by the Secretary General of the Council of Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Re@@ agent for the group of blood needs to react with all tested blood samples which contained the an@@ tigen , containing the anti@@ bodies , or any other on the label . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a Re@@ agent is recommended in the manufacturer recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or appar@@ i@@ tions may not occur : A ) ug@@ ly properties ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tit@@ er is measured twice in a suitable medium by di@@ lution of the re@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated re@@ ag@@ ility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tit@@ er is the real value of the number of the strongest ser@@ um diluted in which a reaction occurs , the di@@ lution will be calculated exclusively to the volume of blood @-@ body inflation in the total volume . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other reag@@ ents which should be used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by time which is required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the World Health Organization has established international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ D reag@@ ents for blood group determination International standards and for reag@@ ents of other specific@@ ity are developed at present standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to definition a particular number of international units per mg or ml ; and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters , which are observed in single preparations in red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( 1 ) The effectiveness of reag@@ ents for blood group determination is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ational sti@@ ckers who will be observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions during a er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te cycle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tit@@ er gives the di@@ lution of the Re@@ ag@@ enz@@ es in the last mixture inside a series , in which a micro@@ scop@@ ically visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a Re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its necessary properties will remain at least one year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the exp@@ iry date of a reag@@ ent form according to label is no more than one year after the last satisfactory effectiveness .
the exp@@ iry date for dry reag@@ ents is based on the results of the holding tests ; it is appro@@ ving by the state supervisory authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dry reag@@ ents are kept in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , and in the glass container , in which they have been dried , so that no humidity can penet@@ rate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a dry co@@ incidence may lose no more than 0,5 BC of its weight if it is caused by further drying excess phosph@@ or@@ bit@@ d at a pressure of no more than 0.0@@ 2 mm Hg within 24 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to prevent bacterial growth , the responsible state agency can determine that the reag@@ ent and / or antibiot@@ ic can be added , if the reag@@ ent is provided with the added substance the requirements of specific@@ ity and effectiveness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sera human origin for the blood type of blood must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein @-@ nitrogen per m@@ um or re@@ dissolved power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reag@@ ents , in@@ valid whether in flu@@ o@@ zed form or after repeti@@ tion , must be transparent and may not contain sedi@@ ments or visible particles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as the international exchange of reag@@ ents for blood group determination should not be colored , at least as long as the international agreement has come about a uniform system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reag@@ ents for blood group determination can be distributed in such a way and in such quantities not only for carrying out tests with unknown blood cells , but also for carrying out tests with positive and negative control blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the amount of content in a container must be so large , that the content may be used to conduct the efficacy evidence described in this protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the manufacturer @-@ Lab has all production levels and insp@@ ections of reag@@ ents for certain group determination to perform written records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonable samples of all reag@@ ent reag@@ ents can be kept as long from the laboratory , until some probability be accepted that the load is no longer used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reag@@ ents used for blood type can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral origin ) ; some of them represent the necessary aid to strengthen the effectiveness and maintaining the stability of the reag@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for technical reasons these reag@@ ents are divided according to the origin of their effective component in three groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this does not mean that the reag@@ ents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal reag@@ ents can contain no matter of human origin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on each of the containers being a black printed label in English and French , the following data contains : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the effectiveness of the ser@@ um may in no case exceed 64 international units per ml .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ A ser@@ um is mixed with an object carriers using an equal amount of 5@@ - , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B blood cells in double time , if the same attempt is performed using the same amount , but un@@ diluted , the anti @-@ A blood group or a standar@@ dised drug of same Avi@@ dity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anti @-@ B ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of selected persons by group A which can be immun@@ ized by red blood cells or by specific substances of group B .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ B ser@@ um glut@@ in@@ ates human red blood cells , i.e. those of blood cells B and AB ; it ag@@ it@@ ates no human red blood cells that contain no B @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood cells 0 and A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an anti @-@ B ser@@ um is parallel to the again dissolved , but un@@ diluted , the anti @-@ B blood group or a corresponding comparison of vitamin B @-@ blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ B ser@@ um is mixed with a equal amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent incre@@ ment of B @-@ blood cells , which is necessary if the same attempt to be dissolved with the same amount of blood type or anti @-@ B blood type or with a standar@@ dised drug of equal avi@@ dity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of selected persons in group 0 which can be obtained by red blood cells or specific substances of group A and group B .
anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells which include ag@@ glut@@ in@@ u@@ genic A and / or B , i.e. those of group A including sub @-@ assemblies A1 and A2 ; it ag@@ glut@@ ates no human red blood cells which are not ag@@ glut@@ in@@ u@@ genic A or B ; i.e. those of the group 0 .
it ag@@ glut@@ ates human red blood cells which contain A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) an@@ tigen ( which are not glut@@ amine in general by anti @-@ A ser@@ um of blood don@@ ors to group B ) .
an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) ser@@ um is parallel to the rest@@ yl@@ ated anti @-@ A blood type body or a corresponding comparison par@@ ate for the floo@@ ding of the A1 and A2 blood cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , it is parallel to the again dissolved , but un@@ diluted fruit@@ - of the anti @-@ B blood group or a corresponding comparison par@@ at against a sampling of B @-@ blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the effectiveness of the ser@@ um may in no case exceed 64 international units per ml .
un@@ diluted anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) bleeding also has an easily recogni@@ zable ag@@ glut@@ ination of blood cells by the group A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) .
an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) ser@@ um is mixed with equal amounts of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent sample floo@@ ding in double time if the same tests must be performed with the same dissolved as an anti @-@ A blood group or with a standard preparation of equal activity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) ser@@ um is mixed with a equal amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent sampling within the double time , if the same attempt to be dissolved using the same amount of blood type or anti @-@ B blood type or a standar@@ dised drug of same Avi@@ dity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anti @-@ B + an anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) ser@@ um is mixed with the same amount of a 5@@ - to 10@@ percent incre@@ ment by A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) and thus the ag@@ glut@@ ination should occur within 5 minutes at a temperature of 18 to 25 Â° C .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ R@@ h blood group sera each specific@@ ity can belong to one of two species , which is at@@ tained through the requirements of using the ag@@ glut@@ ination of hom@@ olog@@ ous blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with others who are described as &quot; in@@ complete &quot; , an ag@@ glut@@ ination can only be achieved by means of specific col@@ lo@@ ids such as beef en@@ um@@ in or with other special methods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some &quot; in@@ complete &quot; Ser@@ a ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating on object bars also homo@@ e@@ red blood cells which are perf@@ ected in their own ser@@ um or plasma .
the following requirements for the effectiveness of ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h group may be subject to change if International standard preparations are available ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group ser@@ um ( human )
anti @-@ D ser@@ um is obtained from the blood one or more people who have immun@@ ized by the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it reacts with human red blood cells which include the an@@ tigen , but not with human red blood cells , which do not include the an@@ tigen D . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 32 against C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent salt solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

anti @-@ C ser@@ um is obtained from the blood one or several persons that are immun@@ ized by the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it reacts with the floods of human red blood cells which contain the an@@ tigen C , but not contain human red blood cells , which do not contain the C an@@ tigen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these Ser@@ a are therefore only specific for the C attacks , when the tested blood cells are weigh@@ ed in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent salt solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tit@@ er of the anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 versus C@@ cd@@ de@@ e blood cells .
