&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present document is a summary of the European Public Fund ( EP@@ AR ) , in which explains how the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) evalu@@ ates the studies with regard to recommendations concerning the application of the medication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you need further information about your disease or treatment , please check the package age ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you wish further information regarding the recommendations of the CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of EP@@ AR ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is available as 5 mg / 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) as a solution to redeem ( 1 mg / ml ) and as a solution for injection ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ res thinking and speech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or vision of things that are not present ) , Mis@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ del@@ ines ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance ( Peri@@ o@@ ds of abnormal high@@ es ) alter@@ nat@@ ely with periods of normal mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ bili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe em@@ ical episodes and to prevent academic episodes in patients , which have addressed in the past to the medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; injection solution is applied to rapid control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , if the oral intake of the medication is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both conditions , the solution for intake or the fusion tablets can be applied to patients with the swal@@ lowing of tablets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for patients who take other medicines at the same time , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adapted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this imp@@ lies the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells to each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ otonin ) is probably effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and d@@ op@@ amine is less than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter in order to activate the recept@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin bear a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , the activity of the brain is reduced to norm@@ alize psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effectiveness of o@@ bili@@ fy , preventing the symptoms occur , was investigated in three studies up to one year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; efficacy of injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , or similar disorders , compared to increased un@@ rest over a period of two hours compared to a plac@@ ebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was examined over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study , compared to 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms were stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the effectiveness of im@@ plant injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which had been compared to succes@@ sive un@@ rest when compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all studies , the changes of the symptoms of patients was studied using a standard scale of bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients receiving treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the company also conducted studies to investigate as the body absor@@ bs the fusion tablets and the solution to capture absor@@ bers ( taking up ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the two trials involving the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , significantly higher reduction in symptoms of increased un@@ rest than those who received a plac@@ ebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when used to treat bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy in four of the five language studies man@@ ic symptoms more effective than plac@@ ebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ bili@@ fy had also prevented for up to 74 weeks more effective than plac@@ ebo , re@@ occur Man@@ ian episodes for previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses have also more effective than plac@@ ebo , increased un@@ rest and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common adverse events of A@@ bili@@ fy to take ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders ( in@@ sti@@ ction ) , vom@@ iting and exhaus@@ tion ( in@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ less@@ ness , ind@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) and anxiety .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and of moderate to severe inci@@ dents diagnosed with bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder and the prevention of a new lack of episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , compared with the risks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , the Committee came to the result that the benefits of inj@@ us@@ tice with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or patients with man@@ ic epis@@ odes are not suitable to ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the risk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission issued Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd. approved for placing the traffic of A@@ bili@@ fy in the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe inci@@ dents of bi@@ polar disorders , and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode which had mainly man@@ ische episodes and discussed the man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an increased effectiveness of doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
efficacy of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ i@@ - distur@@ b@@ ance in patients from 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to the higher sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initi@@ ate dose should be considered if clinical factors jus@@ tify them ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the CY@@ P3@@ A4 @-@ induction included in combination therapy , the recommended dosage should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior includes psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective distur@@ ban@@ ces , and was reported in some cases after the start or change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic medication , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; results of an epidemic study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar distur@@ b@@ ance , there was no elevated risk risk associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ari@@ op@@ ha@@ z@@ ol should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known car@@ cin@@ ogenic diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , heart failure disease , hy@@ po@@ vol@@ a@@ emia ( treatment with bloo@@ d@@ ho@@ bic doses ) or hyper@@ ton@@ ia ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials that lasted a year or less , there was occasion@@ al reports about the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol concerned Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the patients treated with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y therapy signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ oi@@ esis should occur in consider@@ ations , reduce the dose or canc@@ ell the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a patient developed signs and symptoms appearing on a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics must be ab@@ sent including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Ari@@ op@@ ha@@ z@@ ole should be applied in patients with sei@@ zu@@ res in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese or with conditions associated with caution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
56 - 99 years ) associated with Ari@@ op@@ ha@@ z@@ ol in patients with psych@@ osis who were treated with the Alzheimer &apos;s disease ; patient treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an elevated risk of death compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in one of these studies , there was a study with fixed dose , a significant relationship between the dosage and response to undes@@ irable cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ azi@@ de or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no precise risk assessment for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs treated , which allow direct compar@@ is@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie ( poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients suffering from diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should regularly be monitored in relation to deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , a weight gain is generally found in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ates patients and patients with bi@@ polar@@ isation , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , with which weight gain as side effect is observed and could lead to severe complications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , caution is careful when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective drug side effects such as sedi@@ ment ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the H2 and agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a ga@@ stri@@ c @-@ blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical study with healthy subjects , a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or increased the AU@@ C from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % , while the C@@ max remained unchanged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore should have similar dos@@ is@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism can result together with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 in higher Plasma concentrations as a result of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive met@@ abol@@ ism .
if the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors are considered to be considered the potential benefit of potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV proteins have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after setting the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the dose height before beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 can be given together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y to be expected with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
clinical studies demonstrated doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day not a significant effect on the metabolism of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ ysts ) and 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ol ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant , or plan a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to in@@ sufficient data base for people and due to the concerns in pregnancy , this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefit jus@@ ti@@ fies the potential risk of fet@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics the patients should be warned of , dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , to operate , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had no negative influence on them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo , or were classified as possible medical @-@ relevant side effects ( * ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasion@@ al ( &gt; 1 / 1.000 ) &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study about 52 weeks were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( 25.@@ 8 % ) in EPS including Par@@ kin@@ son@@ ic@@ ism , Ak@@ ul@@ atory and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia . compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 13.@@ 1 % were under plac@@ ebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a different controlled long @-@ term study of over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients with da@@ zz@@ ap@@ ine therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Man@@ ical episodes with bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance - in a controlled study of over 12 weeks was the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS is 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
during long @-@ term recovery about 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo treated patients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters appeared , no medical character@@ isation resulted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
increases the CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine Ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) in general temporarily and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic patients were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in comparison to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the side effects that occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic syndrome , Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis and oc@@ clu@@ sion with older demen@@ tia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ intended or deliber@@ ative over@@ dos@@ ages were observed with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without cause . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there is no information about the efficacy of a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis in treating an over@@ dosage with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , however , it is unlikely that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma tray . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I inter@@ ruption involves the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on d@@ op@@ amine d@@ 2 and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a high aff@@ inity to the d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to the d@@ une 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to the alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ net and for hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recep@@ tor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers the Pos@@ it@@ ons Emission Tom@@ ography showed a dos@@ e- dependent reduction of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 @-@ recep@@ tor @-@ Lig@@ anyone . at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on the coup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) , Ari@@ op@@ ha@@ z@@ ole showed statisti@@ cally significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled trial in week 52 the proportion of Respon@@ sibility patients held their response to the study medication , in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current values of measurement scales , which were defined as secondary study potential , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ scale , showed significantly stronger improvement than with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks to stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia showed significantly higher reduction of the decline rate that was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol group and 57 % under Plac@@ ebo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a da@@ zz@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study included in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia ( N = 18 or 13 % of the evaluated patients &apos; weight gain ) ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of approx . 5 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with a flexible dose of 3 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I error showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol a plac@@ ebo over 3 weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study on 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I error , Ari@@ op@@ ha@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy against plac@@ ebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in two plac@@ ebo and actively controlled mon@@ otherapy studies about 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol indicated a result in plac@@ ebo with lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Ari@@ op@@ ha@@ z@@ ole was present 12 of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the mania on like lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study on 6 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms that were not applied on lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at @-@ Mon@@ otherapy in comparison to mon@@ otherapy in comparison to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks followed by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in relation to the prevention of a bi@@ polar back in regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on in vitro studies , the enzyme CY@@ P3@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for dehy@@ dra@@ tion , and hydro@@ xy@@ co@@ z@@ ol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the middle Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ ary life is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole with extensive met@@ abol@@ ism over CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and nearly 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism over CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects as well as in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ine patients either no sexually efficient effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a multip@@ licity @-@ specific evaluation for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics gave no notice to clin@@ ically significant differences in ethnic origin or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ y@@ dr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar to patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single dose study of subjects with a common liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding the impact of the liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ osis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study , in which 460 women participated with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters formerly had received anth@@ ra@@ cyc@@ line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other drugs to reduce side effects ) .
a total of 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients treated to the treatment of 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients with conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considered only the patients who were treated for metastatic breast cancer in the first time , there was no difference between the drug and survival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , patients found other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer in contrast to these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained medicines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) discovered that Abra@@ x@@ ane was not more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained medicines , which may not be given more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el missing drugs to reduce side effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were no studies involving patients with imp@@ aired kidney function , and there are currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adjustment in patients with impair@@ ment of the kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for the use with children under the age of 18 due to sufficient data on harm@@ less@@ ness and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in nan@@ op@@ articles form@@ ulating of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el that could be distinc@@ tly other pharmac@@ ological characteristics described as other form@@ ulations of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be absorbed immediately and a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment should be initiated , and the patient must not be treated with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the patients no new Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be started , until the neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ s increase again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l has risen again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with severe liver failure ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while a clearly identified with Abra@@ x@@ ane in connection of cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity is not unusual , especially in patients with early Anth@@ ra@@ cyc@@ line treatment or underlying heart or lung disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of patients after the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting and diarr@@ ho@@ ea , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ freeze and con@@ fer@@ tive means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not supposed to be prac@@ tised in pregnant women or at women in ven@@ er@@ ous age which are not to be applied except the treatment of mother with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is imper@@ ative .
women in common age should apply during and up to 1 month after the treatment of Abra@@ x@@ ane a reliable contra@@ cep@@ tive method apply .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane is recommended , during and up to six months after the treatment no child could testify . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; male patients should be advised in the treatment of a sperm preser@@ ving , since the treatment of Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of an ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane may cause side effects such as fatigue ( very frequently ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) which can affect the transport of machines and the ability to serve machines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; below are the most common and important inci@@ dents of side effects listed in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated in the piv@@ ot@@ al clinical phase III study every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was reported on most important hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( at 79 % of patients ) , and was quickly reversible and dos@@ ed ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ie reported in 71 % of patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / l ) was observed at 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane patients and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / l ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Table 1 the side effects are listed , which occurred in conjunction with the Gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in every dose and indication ( N = 7@@ 89 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; occasionally : elevated blood pressure , weight gain , increased l@@ at@@ in@@ ine in blood , higher blood sugar , increased phosph@@ orus in blood , reduced potassium in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood of heart disease : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

rest@@ less@@ ness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity is calculated based on a defini@@ tive case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since these events have been reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and there was no longer established connection with these events . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules active ingredient that promotes the co@@ shift of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ular inde@@ er and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by in@@ hibition of her de@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabil@@ isation leads to an inhibit@@ ing of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic membrane functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ in convey@@ ed the trans@@ zy@@ t@@ osis of plasma components to end@@ othel@@ ial cells and in the frame of in @-@ vitro studies was proved that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in is supported by the end@@ othel@@ ial cells .

the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two incar@@ nate studies and of 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ised phase III compar@@ ative study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study , 43 patients treated with metastatic breast cancer with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 m@@ gs / m2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this multi @-@ cent@@ ric study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer ( N = 225 ) or 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
when recording in the study 64 % of patients had a faul@@ t@@ less general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) and 79 % had a vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ asi@@ fication and 19 % due to metast@@ ases and adju@@ van@@ tive treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 9 The results for the general contact and time of progres@@ sion and progres@@ sion @-@ free survival and survival for patients who received &gt; First @-@ Line therapy , are presented below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity compared to P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a regeneration of Neu@@ rop@@ athy C 3 during therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the natural process of peripheral new rop@@ athy , on bas@@ eline , due to the cumul@@ ative tox@@ icity of Abra@@ x@@ ane According to &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the complete P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el according to 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the amount of active exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml with a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 According to intraven@@ ous gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 the P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration increased in multi@@ as@@ hic way .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume has a wide range of ex@@ trav@@ ascular distribution and / or crossover connection of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study of patients with advanced sound tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 175 m@@ g. of m2 of solvent free P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Clear@@ ance of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was above the Abra@@ x@@ ane gift higher ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection and the distribution volume was above Abra@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the published literature about in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue @-@ coated , P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily met@@ aboli@@ zed in two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) and 6@@ α @-@ 3 &quot; p @-@ Di@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ el ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer 4 % of the given total dose for cumul@@ ative ur@@ inary bladder and 3 &quot; p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , more than patients at the age of more than 75 years , however , only 3 patients from this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chemical and physical stability was found at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box , in front of light light over 8 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ cin@@ ogenic drug and as well as other potentially toxic substances should be maintained when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane caution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using a ster@@ ile sy@@ ringe , slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of 9 mg / ml ( 0.0@@ 9 % ) , sodium chloride in@@ fusion solution is inj@@ ected into a Abra@@ x@@ ane transit bottle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the complete addition of the solution , the water bottle should rest for at least 5 minutes to ensure a good grip of the solid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then the barrel bottle should be slowly and / or in@@ adequ@@ ately ru@@ by and / or in@@ adequ@@ ately , until a complete re@@ board of the powder is eff@@ ected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if precip@@ itation or sm@@ el@@ inks are visible , the blood pressure must be in@@ adequ@@ ately propor@@ tioned in order to achieve a complete Res@@ us@@ board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exact dos@@ ages of 5 mg / ml suspension is calculated for the patient , and the corresponding amount of the constitu@@ ant Abra@@ x@@ ane is inj@@ ected into an empty , ster@@ ile PV@@ C@@ - or non @-@ PVC in@@ fusion bag . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the holder of the pharmac@@ ov@@ ig@@ il@@ ance system has to ensure that the pharmac@@ ov@@ ig@@ il@@ ance system is described , as described in version 2.0 , and works in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. by the application , before and while the medicine is transported in traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

if it is not used immediately it may be stored in the dough for up to 8 hours in the refrigerator ( 2 ° C - 8 ° C ) if this is stored in the box to protect the contents from light .
each bottle contains 100 mg P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . • After the reconstruction contains every ml of the suspension 5 mg P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . • The other component is alb@@ umin@@ ris@@ ate and N Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an ( Ph.@@ D. ) ) from the other component .
precau@@ tions for preparing and applying p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ cin@@ ogenic drug and as well as other potentially toxic substances should be maintained when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane caution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using a ster@@ ile sy@@ ringe , slowly over a period of 1 minute 20 ml of 9 mg / ml ( 0.0@@ 9 % ) , sodium chloride in@@ fusion solution is inj@@ ected into a Abra@@ x@@ ane transit bottle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that the bottle is slowly pi@@ voted and / or in@@ vert , until a complete re@@ fills of the powder is done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the patient , calculate the exact dos@@ ages of 5 mg / ml suspension and the corresponding amount of the re@@ constitu@@ ted Abram x@@ ane in an empty , ster@@ ile PVC in@@ fusion bag type IV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; par@@ enter@@ al medicines should be subjected to any inspection , particles and dis@@ col@@ oration if necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stability of un@@ locked bottles with Abra@@ x@@ ane are stable up to the date given on the box , when the sweat water is kept in the box to protect the contents from light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
stability of the con@@ stituted Sus@@ pension in the fly bottle After the first reconstruction the suspension should be filled immediately in a bag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; member states must ensure that the holder of the approval for inclusion in di@@ aly@@ sis centers and retail stores are provided with the following information and materials : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
• training brochure • summary of the characteristics of the medication ( professional information ) , lab@@ eling and package age . • With unique image processing of the product mistak@@ enly cooling boxes for transport through the patient .
this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed on a biological drug is similar in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; reference guide &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is used in patients with normal blood tests , which may occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complications , in case a blood @-@ bloo@@ d@@ shed is not possible and with which a blood loss from 900 to 1 800 ml is expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed must be led under the supervision of a doctor , the experience in the treatment of patients with ill@@ nesses has shown to be shown for the medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a self @-@ bloo@@ d@@ shed , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the injection can also be made by the patient or its support person if they have received an appropriate guide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with chronic kidney failure or patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ds should always lie in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 g per de@@ fer@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the iron values of all patients can be used before the treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists , and iron supplements should be given during the entire treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy alone , or in patients with kidney problems an an@@ emia can be caused by a er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ inal deficiency , or that the body is not sufficient to the body &apos;s own er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used to increase the number of red blood cells to reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is produced by a cell , into which a gene ( DNA ) was brought to the formation of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with injection as an injection on a v@@ ein in the framework of a main study with 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems , compared to reference for reference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected at least eight weeks before they had been inj@@ ected at least eight weeks before they were received , or continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
main indic@@ ative for efficacy was the change of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ocular values between the beginning of the study and the interval period in weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company also presented the results of a study , in which the effects of under the skin were investigated by the skin of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o with 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study of patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ation of patients were treated in the same measurements as in those patients who continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in comparison , the patients showed continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , an increase of 0.@@ 0@@ 63 g / l of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is a rise in blood pressure that can sometimes lead to symptoms of ab@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden f@@ aint head@@ ache and turbul@@ ence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed should not be applied in patients who may possibly be in@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa or one of the other ingredients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed as inj@@ ections under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , as further studies are necessary to ensure that they are caused by no allergic reactions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , the drug for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached that the medicine has been demonstrated as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o for comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for medical professionals , the company , the Ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information about the safety of the drug in all Member States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; August 2007 , the European Commission approved the company Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines GmbH &amp; Co . kg an approval for the placing of Ab@@ se@@ amed across the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / l &#91; 6.2 - 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; ; no iron deficiency could be used in case of planned greater operating procedures ( 4 or more units blood for women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the reduction of foreign bl@@ ut , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used in front of a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic treatment in adults without iron deficiency , at which a high risk of transaction compensation is expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
HB 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml can be applied to participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous hem@@ at@@ ric program .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / l ( 6,2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except for pap@@ at@@ ric patients with the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ation between 9.5 and 11 g / l ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; symptoms and symptoms can vary depending on age , gender and total disease @-@ last ; therefore , the assessment of individual clinical trials and illness resistance is required by the doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a rise in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in to more than 2 g / l / l ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , occasionally , individual hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ation values can be observed with or under the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ation target concentration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of these hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ations , a corresponding dose can be tried to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / l ( 6,2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / l ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ation exceeds more than 2 g / l ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ je 12 g / l ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) exceeds by 25 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be closely monitored in order to ensure that Epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest permitted dose , which is applied to control the an@@ a@@ emia and the dietary symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may be lower than patients where the initial an@@ a@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / l or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6,@@ 8 g / l or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may be lower than patients where the initial an@@ a@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / l or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week through intraven@@ ous application if necessary with a dose of 25 i.@@ U. / kg ( three times per week ) to the desired target value is done ( this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; symptoms and symptoms can vary depending on age , gender and total disease @-@ last ; therefore , the assessment of individual clinical trials and illness resistance is required by the doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of these hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ations , a corresponding dose can be tried to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / l ( 6,2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / l ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be supervised , in order to ensure that Epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest permitted dose , which is applied to control of the symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if after 4 treatment weeks of the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ation of at least 1 g / l ( 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the pre@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ sion@@ al count of ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l should be retained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg per week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ation increased &lt; 1 g / l ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the prec@@ urs@@ or number of &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l should be lifted up to 300 I.@@ U. / kg every week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if after another 4 treatment weeks with 300 I.@@ U. / kg ( ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reproduction number of cells by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l should be retained three times a week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ation has increased by &lt; 1 g / l ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the pre@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ties by &lt; 0.0@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the treatment of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be demolished .
patients with light an@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rite 33 - 39 % ) in which the prescribed storage of ≥ 4 blood @-@ conservative required should be given se@@ clu@@ ded in a dose of 600 i.@@ E. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before operating procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the Iron sub@@ stitution should be as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous bleeding program , which may be used to treat large iron reserves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
6 The recommended dose is 600 I.@@ U. / kg ep@@ o@@ tin al@@ fa which should be given once weekly for three weeks ( day 21 : 14 and 7 ) before operating procedure and the day of the surgery ( Day 0 ) .
the ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg every 10 consecutive days prior to the day of the surgery and 4 days immediately thereafter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis on the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ on@@ ical cooking salt solution to ensure the hose and ensure adequate injection of the medication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients who are reported under the treatment with any Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin ( Pure red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should be obtained no se@@ clu@@ ded or another Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin ( see Section 4.4 ) .

Er@@ y@@ th@@ rob@@ la@@ stop@@ over ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely was reported on the occurrence of antibody @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA following months to years of sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients with sudden activity loss , defined as a reduction of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ation ( 1 - 2 g / l per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fusion ( ice , fo@@ lic acid or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ mol@@ y@@ se ) should be investigated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the prec@@ urs@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , considering taking the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te &quot; Index ) , and if no other cause of active loss is found , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin antibody is considered to be considered an investigation of bone loss for diagnosis of a PR@@ CA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
data for immun@@ ogen@@ icity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous application of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of anti @-@ induc@@ ed PR@@ CA ( patients with class an@@ emia ) are not enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 8 In cases of chronic kidney failure , in case of maintenance the lower limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is not exceeded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in clinical trials an increased mortality risk and risk of severe cardi@@ ac oc@@ ascular events were observed when Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ese @-@ stimul@@ ating agents ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ - target concentration of over 12 g / l ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; controlled clinical trials have shown no significant benefit , which is attri@@ but@@ able to the gift of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine symptoms and avoiding the control of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions related to blood trans@@ fu@@ sions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ation intake should be approximately 1 g / l ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of growth in high blood pressure .
in case of patients with chronic kidney failure and clinical evidence of con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure in case of maintenance the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the present knowledge , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia should be treated with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ tin al@@ fa with kidney failure , which are not di@@ aly@@ zed by the disease of the kidney failure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in tum@@ our patients under chemotherapy , a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay of ep@@ o@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ gift and the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin @-@ answer must be considered ( patients who need to be trans@@ f@@ used ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the H@@ b rise is greater than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / l ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) must be adjusted to reduce the risk of possible thro@@ mb@@ ot@@ ical events ( see Section 4.2 ) of patients with chem@@ ist an@@ emia - can hold the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ation between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision for application re@@ combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on the benefit of risk reduction under the participation of the patient , which should also take into consideration the specific clinical context . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for patients receiving an elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery , if possible , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be studied and treated accordingly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients that undergo an elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery , an appropriate thro@@ mb@@ osis was supposed to have an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ ot@@ eric and vas@@ cul@@ ar@@ tic diseases especially during an adequate cardiovascular disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it cannot be excluded that in the treatment with ep@@ o@@ tin al@@ fa to patients with an output badge of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk of postoperative thro@@ mb@@ ot@@ ical / vas@@ cul@@ ari@@ ous events can consist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in several controlled trials , it was not proven for ep@@ och@@ ine that patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia would improve the overall survival or reduce the risk of progres@@ sion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer , they received chemotherapy ; if a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration was reduced from 12 - 14 g / l ( 7,5 - 8.@@ m@@ mo@@ l / l ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
will be used with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in together with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in and should be adapted to the blood levels of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in and adjusted with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ ind@@ osis to increasing hem@@ at@@ oc@@ racy .
no references to interaction between ep@@ o@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F does not result in hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or pro@@ liferation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thro@@ mb@@ osis , v@@ ascular diseases such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dium attacks , fung@@ al thro@@ mb@@ osis , fung@@ al thro@@ mb@@ osis , an@@ thro@@ mb@@ osis , an@@ thro@@ po@@ thro@@ mb@@ osis , an@@ thro@@ po@@ thro@@ mb@@ osis , an@@ thro@@ po@@ thro@@ mb@@ osis , an@@ thro@@ po@@ thro@@ mb@@ osis , an@@ thro@@ thro@@ po@@ genic wounds , such as patients under er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin , thus also reported patients among ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common adverse effect during treatment with ep@@ o@@ tin al@@ fa is a dos@@ is@@ dependent increase of blood pressure or deteri@@ oration of an existing Hyper@@ tension . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ vas@@ cul@@ tic events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients under the treatment of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ inen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ir@@ respective of the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treatment , it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular risk to thro@@ mb@@ h and vas@@ cul@@ ari@@ ous complications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gene@@ tically denied ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa is gly@@ col and in terms of amino acids and carbohydrates content identical with the end@@ ogen@@ ous human Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin that was isolated from the urine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could be demonstrated with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ tial cells , that ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa stimulates and un@@ affected the leu@@ kop@@ o@@ ese . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ og@@ bla@@ st@@ osis ( 221 multiple my@@ el@@ ome , 144 non @-@ Hodg@@ kin@@ ly@@ mph@@ oma and 24 other hem@@ og@@ cin@@ oma cells ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tum@@ ors ( 172 gy@@ na@@ car@@ cin@@ omas and 22 % car@@ cin@@ omas and 21 car@@ cin@@ omas and 30 other patients ) .

survival and tumor progres@@ sion were investigated in five big monitored studies with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies and
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the open study , no difference between the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin patients treated patients and the control patient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin patients treated with an@@ emia due to several common mal@@ ign@@ ome consistent , statisti@@ cally significantly higher mortality rates than in the controls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in incidence of thro@@ mb@@ osis and related complications , associated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin patients and with controls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is an increased risk for th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cal events in tum@@ our patients who are treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin , and a negative impact on the overall survival can not be excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not clari@@ fied how far the results are treated on the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin in tum@@ our patients with the objective of transfer@@ ring a hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ge under 13 g / dl ) as a few patients were included with these characteristics .
ep@@ o@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ provisions after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life time of approximately 4 hours for healthy volunteers and an extended half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with kidney disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the ser@@ um levels of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa are much lower than the ser@@ um levels , which are reached after intraven@@ ous injection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no grief : the ser@@ um levels remain equal , regardless of whether they will be determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you suffer from Er@@ y@@ th@@ rob@@ la@@ sty , your therapy is treated with se@@ clu@@ ded and set how your an@@ emia is best treated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by inj@@ ections in a v@@ ein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated for an an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ation is the risk of problems associated with the heart or blood vessels and the death of death may be increased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with elevated or increasing calibration , your doctor may take into account a break in the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed up until the potassium levels lie in the norm range . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clinical obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ed is not exceeds a certain value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the present knowledge , the treatment of blood arm@@ rests with Ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( kidney failure ) , which are not yet to be accelerated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ o@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ gift and the desired effect should be taken into account for the assessment of the effectiveness of di@@ fl@@ amed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 200 Your doctor regularly will determine your values of the red blood @-@ color@@ less ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) , and match your di@@ fl@@ amed dose as possible to keep the risk of blood glucose ( thro@@ mb@@ ot@@ eric event ) as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , this risk should be very carefully balanced from the treatment with ep@@ o@@ tin al@@ fa drugs , e.g. if you have an increased risk for thro@@ mb@@ ot@@ ha@@ vas@@ cul@@ ine events ( e.g. a deep ven@@ enth@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis or lung bu@@ lie ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case you are cancer patients , consider that se@@ al@@ amed as a growth factor for blood cells , and at certain circumstances may affect the tum@@ our . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an orthop@@ edic operation is im@@ min@@ ent , the cause of your an@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your value of the red blood @-@ color@@ less ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) is too high , you should not get rid of Ab@@ se@@ amed because an increased risk of blood c@@ rop@@ ho@@ bias after surgery is made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use other medicines consuming / apply / apply recently , even if it is not prescri@@ ption medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you take Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to op@@ pression of the immune system ) during your therapy using Ab@@ se@@ amed your doctor will prescri@@ be certain blood tests to measure blood levels of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have no interaction between ep@@ o@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F ) are means of building the immune system e.g. for cancer chemotherapy or at HIV ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on how your blood level ( an@@ a@@ emia ) can be applied to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted for every four weeks until your state is under control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your doctor may arrange to check out regular blood tests in order to check and ensure the treatment correctly , and your hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ation does not exceed a certain value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you are adjusting well , you will receive regular doses of ab@@ se@@ clu@@ ded between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice weekly , distributed on two equal inj@@ ections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your doctor may arrange to check regular blood tests in order to check and ensure the treatment success , your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ er value does not exceed a certain value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on how the an@@ emia should be applied to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted for every four weeks until the condition is under control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure this and ensure that the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ er value does not exceed a certain value , the doctor will conduct regular blood tests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if necessary , to sh@@ orten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days prior to surgery , on the day of intervention and further 4 days after surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if your doctor may keep this appropriate , you can also learn how to spra@@ w@@ ling itself under the skin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects will affect you , or if you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this manual information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when an injection of the fridge has been taken and room temperature has reached ( up to 25 ° C ) , it must be used either within 3 days or be rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ac@@ la@@ sta is applied to the treatment of the following diseases : • o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease affecting the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause as well as in men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is applied to patients with high risk reduction ( bone qu@@ arri@@ es ) , including patients who have recently been suffered from a trau@@ matic hill as during the H@@ inf@@ all ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease which changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days before the first in@@ fusion a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or by injection in a muscle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subsequent symptoms of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means of inflammation ) can reduce the symptoms occurring in three days after in@@ fusion , like fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ ache . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta may only be prescribed by doctors that have experience in treating this disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta , is like in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material was drawn to the assessment of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first study almost 8 000 older women were involved with o@@ steopor@@ osis , and it was investigated by spinal cord over a three years period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the second study included 2 127 male men and women with o@@ steopor@@ osis for over 50 years which recently suffered a hip c@@ ture . the number of frac@@ tures were examined over a period of up to five years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta has been tested in two studies at a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( one other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
main indic@@ ative for efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in the ser@@ um ( an enzyme which is broken down ) in the blood reg@@ alised or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study with older women , the risk of spinal cord was reduced in patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without other o@@ steopor@@ osis therapy ) over a period of three years compared to plac@@ ebo 70 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other o@@ steopor@@ osis therapy ) , those under plac@@ ebo was reduced by 41 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 from 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most side effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta occur in the first three days of the in@@ fusion , and are less frequently repeated in@@ fusion in the first three days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ac@@ la@@ sta cannot be applied in patients who may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) to o@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ ate or other ingredients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like all bis@@ phosph@@ ate patients , patients at Ac@@ la@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion center and o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis ( cause of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the manufacturer of Ac@@ la@@ sta is prepared for physi@@ cians who would use Ac@@ la@@ sta for the treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medication should be explained and pointed to the physician . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in April 2005 , the European Commission issued Nov@@ arti@@ s Europ@@ harm &apos;s European Commission approval for the placing of Ac@@ la@@ sta in the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • The patient information package should be provided and the following key messages include : • The package activity • Re@@ quired physical activity , Non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant symptoms and symptoms for severe side effects • When to access medical or nursing help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis • in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk for frac@@ tures including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hill frac@@ ture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis and o@@ steopor@@ osis in men , an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once a year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic fra@@ ctions the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of the frac@@ ture frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors that have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta a long division was observed in patients who asked for the treatment ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is advisable to make a sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get to ensure minimum 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic con@@ vent , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.@@ E. or@@ alem or intra@@ muscular type D is recommended prior to the first Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , can be reduced by the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min is not recommended as limited clinical experiences for these patient group are currently available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elim@@ ination in older patients is similar to younger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
children and adolescents Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended for the use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age because data are missing to in@@ consistency and efficacy .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ suffici@@ ency &lt; 35 ml / min ) as a limited clinical experience for this patient population .
an existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is treated before the treatment of Ac@@ la@@ sta by sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the quick one of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid on bone structure , it can develop a transi@@ ent that occurs under symp@@ tom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is advisable to make a sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get to ensure minimum 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see paragraph 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
canc@@ ers ( chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene ) should be considered a dental treatment with appropriate pre@@ venti@@ l@@ ating dental treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for patients suffering from dental access , no data is available whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduced the risk of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in the jaw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clinical assessment by the treated doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient , based on an individual benefit risk assessment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; symptoms of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , can be reduced by acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incidence of adverse cases of hop@@ al fibrill@@ ation was increased in patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta , increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to those who received plac@@ ebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 from 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in o@@ steopor@@ osis studies ( PFT H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ ren@@ to Frac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) the total th@@ reading of pre @-@ hop@@ al fibrill@@ ation was comparable between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug actions are listed in Table 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
kidney dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with kidney dys@@ functions ( i.e. an increase of ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases , as acute kidney failure .
the change in the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ( annually before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure and a restricted kidney function were comparable to o@@ steopor@@ osis in three years comparable to the Ac@@ la@@ im and the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a temporary increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of the gift was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta , compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the transi@@ ent asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values were treated under 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all patients received additional amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study on post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis , in the study on prevention of clinical frac@@ tures after frac@@ ture frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study on avoiding clinical aspects , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , however , the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local reactions After the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion centre , such as redness , sw@@ elling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses , particularly in cancer patients , above o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses ( primarily in the jaw @-@ field ) reported that with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid , were treated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of these patients had signs for local infections including o@@ ste@@ opathy , and the majority of reports refers to cancer patients after tooth extraction and other dental attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
7 study of 7.@@ 7@@ 36 patients came up in o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis in the or@@ tho@@ don@@ tics with Ac@@ la@@ sta and in a plac@@ ebo treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of over@@ dosing , which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , can be achieved through the gift of oral calcium and / or an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis ( PFT G ) once a year for 3 consecutive years was recorded in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( 7.@@ 7@@ 36 women between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density filter or a BM@@ D @-@ T @-@ Score for the upper body as ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of existing verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric spinal cord ac@@ la@@ sta significantly reduced over a period of three years and already after a year the frequency of one or several new spinal frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
Ac@@ la@@ sta treated patients aged 75 and older had a 60 % reduced risk of spinal cord compared to plac@@ ebo patients ( p &lt; 0.0@@ 001 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta showed a constant effect over three years which resulted in a reduced risk of acet@@ abul@@ um in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta raised the bone density of the lum@@ bar acid , hips and dist@@ al radius compared to plac@@ ebo treatment ( 6 : 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase of the density of lum@@ bar of the lum@@ bar region by 6.7 % of the th@@ igh area rose by 5.@@ 1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bone hist@@ ology include 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis patients who were treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 82 ) , a year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies from the pel@@ vis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ographic ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in comparison to plac@@ ebo increasing the bearing bones and bone structure .
bones @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) in ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C col@@ lagen ( b @-@ CT@@ X ) ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C @-@ T@@ elop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ X ) ser@@ um were determined in periodi@@ cal intervals throughout the duration of the study .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose Ac@@ la@@ sta reduced B@@ SAP by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the starting point up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the starting point after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below output value to 36 months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B @-@ CT@@ X was reduced significantly at 61 % below the output value after 12 months , and was kept at 55 % below the starting point up to 36 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received a initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before the in@@ fusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the total mort@@ ality stood at 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta , compared with 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT analysis raised the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment in comparison to plac@@ ebo treatment the BM@@ D on the total balance sheet as at all time points .
the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment resulted in comparison for 24 months in comparison to plac@@ ebo treatment by 5.4 % in total and around 4.3 % on the net th@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clinical effectiveness in males in H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT analysis were random@@ ized , and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated during 24 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the study was not designed for a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in plac@@ ebo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another study of men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once @-@ year administration of Ac@@ la@@ ise was not related to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e @-@ BM@@ D after 24 months in comparison to the initial value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
clinical effectiveness of treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ la@@ sta has been studied in patients at the age of 30 years with radi@@ ological phosph@@ at@@ ase ( mean ser@@ um levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in accordance with 2.@@ 6@@ x to 3.@@ x @-@ specific upper normal threshold for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid compared to the intake of 30 mg Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily for 2 months was proved in two six months compar@@ ative studies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain relief was observed in comparison with the initial value for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate after 6 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients who were classified as responsibilities at the end of the six month period ( on the therapy ) were included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta and the 107 with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate treated patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study compared with 71 of the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate patients with a mean period of follow @-@ up of 18 months after application .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid with 64 patients gave the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data to be dos@@ ed independently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after that the plasma level increased rapidly at &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h followed by a long lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the highest value .
rapid bi@@ ph@@ astic dis@@ appearance of the great circulation system with half @-@ life hours t / 1 ½ a 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a long Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ al period with a terminal elim@@ ination of the elim@@ ination period t ½ to 146 hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the early distribution has@@ en ( stainless steel and white , with the above mentioned 1 ½ -@@ s ) represent the fast res@@ or@@ ption in bone and ex@@ cre@@ tion of the kidneys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first 24 h , 39 ± 16 % of the desired dose in the urine is found while the rest is mostly bound to bone tissue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the total body @-@ Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , breed or body weight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes was reduced by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion but had no effect on the area under the curve ( plasma concentration towards time ) .
a dimin@@ ished clearing of met@@ al@@ ous @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ enzyme for met@@ alli@@ zed substances is unlikely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic is not met@@ aboli@@ zed not yet immediate and / or ir@@ reversible , material @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of p@@ 450@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance and was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this results in a light ( cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) , and an even kidney interference with up to 35 ml / min does not require a dose adjustment of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for heavy kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data are available , no statements are available for this population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
acute tox@@ icity The highest not @-@ effective intraven@@ ous cell dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight and with rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for studies on dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C ) were administered at the recommended Human @-@ Therapeu@@ tic exposure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sub@@ chronic and chronic tox@@ icity in studies with intraven@@ ous application was given a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , resulting in intervals of 2- 3 weeks ( a cumul@@ ative dose which corresponds to AU@@ C , corresponds to AU@@ C , corresponds ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated application of cumul@@ ated ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum of intended human @-@ exposure , including the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tra@@ ct and the liver as well as on intraven@@ ous injection site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most frequent occurrence of studies with repeated application was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ se of the long bones in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , an attack which reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ re@@ or@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an Ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ icity is observed at doses above 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such a skel@@ eton .
in rab@@ bits no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed even though the maternal tox@@ icity was pronounced in 0,1 mg / kg as a result of being low @-@ calcium mirror .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic skull frac@@ ture , it is recommended that in@@ fusion from Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after operating the hip frac@@ ture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before and after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , patients need to be supplied with liquid only ; this is particularly important for patients who received a di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the quick one of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone structure , a temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic mat@@ ured , hypo@@ kal@@ mia can develop their maximum normally within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is advisable to ensure an adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get to ensure minimum 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta during a minimum of 10 days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic skull frac@@ ture , a starting dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.@@ E. or@@ alem or intra@@ muscular type D is recommended prior to the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA is used in addition to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients suffering from a body mass index ( body mass index - BMI ) from 30 kg / m ² or over or • the overweight ( BMI of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and beyond that or more
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , four trials over 7 000 patients were performed in which A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA was used in comparison to a plac@@ ebo as supporting remedy for smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to study the smoking at@@ titudes , there were no consistent findings , so that the effect of A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA was hard to assess the effect on this application area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; summary of the EP@@ AR to the public The present document is an abstract of the European Public Fund ( EP@@ AR ) , in which explains how the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has been evaluated to provide recommendations concerning the application of the medication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients with other di@@ ab@@ et@@ ational treatment ( du@@ otherapy ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , which can be used with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose cannot be satisfactory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in combination with a sulph@@ ate resin or insulin , the existing dose of the sulph@@ ate agent can be sustained , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; it should be reduced to the dose of the Sul@@ fon@@ amide ( low blood sugar ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the body @-@ own insulin may be utilized better and the blood sugar level decreases , which makes type 2 diabetes better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ otherapy research was investigated , in addition , the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cer@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which shows how well the blood sugar is set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ac@@ tos lead to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ value that makes it possible to reduce blood sugar levels by using the dosing of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the Tri@@ ple@@ otherapy study the effect of an additional gift from Ac@@ tos to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ance showed a reduction of 0.0@@ 94 % while the extra gift of plac@@ ebo resulted in a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin had been studied in addition to insulin , a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in patients who received additional plac@@ ebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common adverse events related to ac@@ tos were vision disorders , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( cold ) , weight gain and hy@@ po@@ e@@ thesia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ac@@ tos should not be applied to patients who may react to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or one of the other components in patients with liver problems or di@@ abe@@ tic valve ( high concentration levels - in blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients with met@@ form@@ in which met@@ form@@ in is not displayed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission issued the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited , approved by Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , ar@@ ched and wear on one side the markings &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the wording &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with insulin for patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ adequate and the met@@ form@@ in is un@@ suitable for contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients suffering at least one risk factor ( e.g. early heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , weight gain or o@@ int@@ ment , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , weight gain and o@@ int@@ ment if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is applied in combination with insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a cardiovascular study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular diseases was performed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this study , the increase of accounts of con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure stated that , however , did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with increased output of liver enzyme ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the norm ) or with other signs of liver illness may not be used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the AL@@ T mirrors are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range , the liver enzyme could re@@ control as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case a patient symptoms are developed to investigate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , th@@ el@@ ess@@ ness , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dar@@ ker Har@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision whether the treatment of patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on should be continued until the anticip@@ ation of the laboratory parameters should be derived from clinical assessment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , dos@@ ed weight gain has been proved that can mix of fat deposits and bound in some cases with a fluid re@@ tention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result of a hem@@ at@@ el@@ ution in the therapy of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on a minor reduction in the mean hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ation values ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.@@ 1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in compar@@ ative controlled trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 1 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensi@@ tivity in patients the Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is obtained as oral or triple @-@ combination therapy with insulin , the risk of a dos@@ ed hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after launch was reported under the treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ Indi@@ c@@ ons , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , about an occurrence or deteri@@ oration of a di@@ abe@@ tic mac@@ ular hole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is un@@ clear if there is a direct link between the intake of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and the occurrence of mac@@ ular o@@ e@@ dem@@ a if patients report on distur@@ ban@@ ces of visual acuity , an appropriate ophthalm@@ ological investigation should be considered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a summary analysis of messages , random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients receiving pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on were treated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the analysis of the frac@@ ture was 1.9 million records per 100 patient years of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on for one 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparison medi@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Pro@@ Active study , study over 3.5 years for study of cardiovascular events , the frac@@ tures were treated with 44 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnant women , and if one patient is pregnant or this entry , treating the treatment ( see Section 4.6 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; studies on the examination of inter@@ actions , that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on showed no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of di@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
inter@@ actions with medicines that are met@@ aboli@@ zed by these enzymes such as oral contra@@ cep@@ tives , Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , cal@@ ci@@ um@@ kan@@ al@@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ er are not expected .
simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on for 3 times .
simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction in AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is due to the treatment of hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother &apos;s pregnancy , reducing the availability of the metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fet@@ al growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very often &gt; 1 / 10 ; common &gt; 1 / 100 ; occasion@@ al &gt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , individual cases : unknown ( from present data not estimated ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ f and refra@@ ctive index , as well as other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic substances can be observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ sti@@ ege stood out equally frequently as under plac@@ ebo , but rare than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ chloride . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a Out@@ come study in patients with existing advanced mac@@ ular disease , the frequency of severe con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure was 1.6 % higher than under plac@@ ebo when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on bz@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the market launch is rarely reported on con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , more often when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was applied in combination with insulin or in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure in An@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was random@@ ised analysis of messages with random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with compar@@ ative medi@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over a period of 3.5 years of the Pro@@ Active study , frac@@ tures were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients that were treated with a compar@@ ative medication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day , over four days , then 180 mg / day , over seven days there were no symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on seems to have an activation of specific kernel recept@@ ors ( per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ liferation ) function in the animal model to an increased insulin sensi@@ tivity of liver , fat and skel@@ eton muscle cells .
it could be showed that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces the glucose production in the liver and the peripheral glucose level increases in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ ci@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ ci@@ on versus two years in order to examine the time until after the therapeutic effect ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time after two years after the start of the therapy a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) was observed by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on at 69 % of the patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under the path@@ ology ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was random@@ ized with insulin , in spite of three im@@ pregn@@ ated optimization , to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in cases under the age of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who were still receiving insulin ; a reduction of the insulin inj@@ ectors in the group treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was observed .
in clinical trials over one year there was a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ ine / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine qu@@ oti@@ an compared to the initial values .
the effect of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus Pla@@ z@@ ebo ) was tested in a small and 18 @-@ week investigation of type 2 di@@ abe@@ tics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in most clinical trials , a reduction of the total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and the increase of HD@@ L@@ - Ch@@ olester@@ insp@@ iegel and slightly significantly reduced LD@@ L Ch@@ olester@@ insp@@ iegel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced the total plas@@ mat@@ ri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L Ch@@ olester@@ insp@@ iegel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in comparison with Pla@@ z@@ ebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase of LD@@ L Ch@@ olester@@ insp@@ iegel was observed while under Met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ ci@@ dal reduced values were observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on did not only dimin@@ ished the so@@ ber @-@ tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de , but also improved tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de @-@ synthesis and tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular disease study , has random@@ ised 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , and existing advanced mac@@ ular disease in groups of either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after oral application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is absorbed quickly , with peak concentrations of un@@ altered Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in the plasma generally 2 hours after application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV represents the effectiveness in about the three times the effectiveness of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in interaction studies could be proven that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on had no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of di@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with belt concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( see Section 4.5 ) .
after oral use of radioactive mark@@ edly Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in humans the mar@@ ker was found mainly in the barrel ( 55 % ) and a lower degree of urine ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma @-@ elim@@ ination period of un@@ changing Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans and the total active met@@ abol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function , whereas the ratios of oral Clear@@ ance of the breast are similar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is due to the treatment of hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother , reducing the availability of the metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fet@@ al growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the analysis of the frac@@ ture was 1.9 million records per 100 patient years of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on for one 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparison medi@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Pro@@ Active study , study over 3.5 years for study of cardiovascular events , the frac@@ tures were treated with 44 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another study , over two years the effects of combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in each was investigated by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in clinical trials over 1 year there was a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ ine / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine qu@@ oti@@ an compared to the initial values .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on did not only dimin@@ ished the so@@ ber @-@ tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de , but increased beyond the effect on tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as on the hec@@ tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de @-@ synthesis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was not able to produce insulin for a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pan@@ cre@@ as is not capable of using insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study , after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cer@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) was measured , which shows how well the blood sugar is set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane resulted in a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror ; which pointed out that the blood sugar levels were similar to much like with another human insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied in patients who may react to human insulin ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or other components .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( the full list is to extract the package directions ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the end that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane weigh down to the risks of diabetes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission approved the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for placing on Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice daily , if a fast initial effect is desired together with a longer lasting effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , patients whose blood sugar may significantly improve due to intensi@@ fied insulin therapy , hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia should be perceived and should be advised accordingly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any change in terms of strength , trademark ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ ph@@ as@@ tical ) and / or production method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA compared to insulin , ) can result in a change of dosage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of change to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in patients a dose adjustment is necessary , this can be necessary during the first dose or months after the conversion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some patients suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions after a change from animal on human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced than in their previous insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before travelling , over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the Council of his medical remedy because such trips can lead to other times that insulin and meals must be applied or taken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the doctor needs to take possible inter@@ actions with the therapy , and all patients always ask themselves after other medicines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d may not be applied in patients who may possibly be sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or other components .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d may be adapted , if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission approved the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 If a dose adjustment is necessary when the patient is required , the dose may be necessary during the first dose or months after the conversion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before travelling , over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the Council of his medical remedy because such trips can lead to other times that insulin and meals must be applied or taken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients , Aden@@ os@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg of patients , administered at once daily 120 mg , with the last three measurements of the blood of under 6 mg / l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in comparison , this was at 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in no one of the 134 patients under Plac@@ ebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common adverse events of aden@@ ab@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diarr@@ he@@ a and nau@@ sea . nau@@ sea and normal liver values .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially in patients with cardiovascular problems in pre@@ history , possibly a higher risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Aden@@ os@@ ic acid was more effective than al@@ om@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects in connection with the heart and blood vessels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
treatment of chronic hypertension in diseases that have already led to urine deposits ( including one from the patient &apos;s history known or present prescri@@ ption and / or arthritis ) .
if the ser@@ um acid is still under 2 @-@ 4 weeks even more &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ n@@ l / l ) can be considered as an increase of a dose of dose to AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg once daily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with severe kidney failure , efficacy and safety were not fully examined until now ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children and adolescents , since there are no experiences with children and you@@ ths , the use of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
organ transplan@@ tation Since there is no experiences with organ transplan@@ ts when the application of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with isch@@ emia heart disease , cardiovascular disease , the treatment with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with other har@@ n@@ lei@@ c acid remedi@@ es , it can be mobili@@ zed during the treatment beginning , because the lowering of the ser@@ um acid level may initially be mobili@@ zed in the tissue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B. in mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , L@@ esh@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in rare cases is to increase so far that it comes to a re@@ location in the urine tract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during clinical trials during Phase 3 , slight up@@ li@@ gible assets were observed in patients treated with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is therefore recommended to carry out before the beginning of the F@@ eb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ ine and in subsequent course of clinical trials ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line T@@ was not performed in@@ trin@@ sic studies on F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that X@@ O inhibit@@ ing can lead to a rise in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line spi@@ ke ( a inhibit@@ ing of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line ) is also reported to other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors did not stand in connection with a clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was described in two pi@@ v@@ ot@@ al studies phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) that were performed using 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ik@@ a@@ emia and poison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; primary efficacy end@@ point was in every study of patients , where the last three month sales of ser@@ um under 6.0 mg / l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ n@@ l / l ) were included . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) ; AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) for patients with ser@@ um incre@@ ment of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / l and ≤ 2.0 mg / l .
the AP@@ EX study showed that the statisti@@ cally significant su@@ peri@@ ority of less than 6 mg / l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ n@@ l / l ) ( see table 2 and Figure 1 ) proved the statisti@@ cally significant difference in the treatment with conventional doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to the lasting lowering of the metabolism of ser@@ um acid levels below 6 mg / l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the statisti@@ cally significant le@@ su@@ peri@@ ority as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conventional used dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with ser@@ um cancer values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 509 ) received samples for analyses . * p &lt; 0.0@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0.0@@ 001 versus 80 mg
the lowering of the ser@@ um acid level at &lt; 6.0 mg / l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ n@@ l / l ) was observed at the physician attendance in week 2 and maintain permanently over the entire treatment .
509 patients received al@@ ab@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um incre@@ ment &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney failure ( d. ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC the primary efficacy end@@ point was achieved at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients achieved .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences regarding the percentage of ser@@ um har@@ mac@@ ular acid concentrations in the group ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney disorders ) .
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um har@@ ass@@ ular con@@ ges@@ tion ≥ 10 mg / dl ) about 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a ser@@ um concentration of ≥ 10 mg / l .
the data collected in two years of the open renewal study during phase 3 showed that less than 3 % of patients resulting in the incidence of disease ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients had taken no treatment for a contamination ) .
this was associated with a reduction of the tox@@ icity file resulting in 54 % of patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the tox@@ in notes up to the month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - Val@@ ues ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ W / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.@@ 0 % ) and received in the open long @-@ term renewal studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the maximum plasma concentrations of Plas@@ ma@@ stur@@ ost@@ at ( C@@ max ) and the area under the Plas@@ ma@@ konzent@@ ration time curve ( AU@@ C ) from F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at to administration was simpler and multiple doses ranging from 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ tically .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for doses of 120 mg and 300 mg is observed for f@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at an increase in AU@@ C , which is larger than the dos@@ ed increase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after taking a simpler or multiple oral dos@@ ages of 80 and 120 mg , the C@@ max is 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5,@@ 0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage reduction of ser@@ um har@@ mac@@ ular concentration was observed ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) from F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at lies in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking part of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plasma selection of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at amounts to around 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding to Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is reached over the concentration width , with doses of 80 and 120 mg is constant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es showed that these oxida@@ tive metabol@@ ites are formed primarily by CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 and CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 9 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ mark@@ edly F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) the dose in the urine is found ( 30 % ) and acet@@ abul@@ ost@@ at of the active substance ( 30 % ) and its known metabolism ( 13 % ) as well as further unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to the ex@@ cre@@ tion of urine over the urine is also about 45 % of the dose in the chair known as un@@ changing F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) and acet@@ ylene metabolism ( 25 % ) and known metal metabolism ( 7 % ) as well as further unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
special patient groups kidney failure after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with slight , moderate or severe con@@ genital heart failure the C@@ max of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at did not change in proportion to subjects with normal kidney function .
the mean overall AU@@ C from F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at increased about 1,8 m / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13,@@ 2 μ g / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
12 liver damage after taking multi@@ pler doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with lighter ( Ch@@ ild@@ - Pu@@ gh @-@ classification B ) of liver damage changed the C@@ max and AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites not significantly change significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes regarding AU@@ C from F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multi@@ dimensional doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impair@@ ment of fertili@@ zation . a statisti@@ cally significant increase in urea bladder and car@@ cin@@ omas increased only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin @-@ stones in the highly dos@@ ed group , with about 11 times exposure to human exposure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of a specific Pur@@ in@@ met@@ aboli@@ zation and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it has been noted that F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproduction capacity of male and female rats .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at high doses , which were about 4,@@ 3 @-@ times of the human therapeutic exposure , the maternal tox@@ icity occurred , resulting in lowering the performance and development delay in rats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ter@@ at@@ ological studies with tra@@ cing rats with ex@@ positions , which approximately the 4.3 times and in supporting rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions indicated about the 13 @-@ times of human @-@ therapeutic exposure , resulted in no ter@@ at@@ ogenic properties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

diarr@@ ho@@ ea , nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are simultaneously treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ ine . * * In clinical trials were observed no severe skin reactions or heavy impact actions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 21 patients with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg were treated with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg for up to 2 years in the open long @-@ term renewal studies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; primary efficacy end@@ point was in every study of patients , where the last three month sales of ser@@ um under 6.0 mg / l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ n@@ l / l ) were included . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some people , the ur@@ ic acid accumul@@ ates in blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that ur@@ ic acid is in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you keep the ur@@ ic acid low by using the 1 x daily intake of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the de@@ formation is prevented and in this way a reduction of complaints achieved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC may not be taken when you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the active ingredient F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or any of the other ingredients of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform your doctor before taking this medicine by taking a heart@@ weakness , or suffering from a high blood problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • If you suffer from a high ur@@ inary disease , or the Les@@ ch Ny@@ han @-@ syn@@ dro@@ ms ( a rare in@@ born disorder in the blood ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate and vitamin D3 are already being separated from other medicines that are approved in the European Union , the company presented data from previous studies and published literature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with o@@ steopor@@ osis to prove the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE relating to increasing vitamin D levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a 15 week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , lower ( 11 % ) than those who only have Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate revenues ( 32 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company also presented data on the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , which is needed for preventing a bone loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common adverse events ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain or joints and symptoms of digestive tract ( indi@@ ges@@ tion ) , ul@@ c@@ osis ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) of es@@ oph@@ agus ( ul@@ cer@@ eal ) as well as suction cups .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE must not be used in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , vitamin D3 or other ingredients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must not be applied for diseases of the es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or patients who can &apos;t stand or sit for at least 30 minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Mer@@ ck Sharp &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd . it has approval for the shipping of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; capsule form , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , beverage or intake of medicines ( including An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day to take .
the following critics are to be followed exactly to reduce the risk of mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is expected to be lu@@ red after the end of the day with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) or the pill is not to be cut off before the first half of the day that should occur at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B . pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gast@@ ro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical intervention in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tra@@ des except p@@ yl@@ ori@@ op@@ la@@ sty but only subject to special caution ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initial ha@@ ge@@ tic reactions , such as Es@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a and mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ tic Stri@@ c@@ tures ( sometimes this severe and required a hospital reference ) were reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the doctor should therefore respect all signs and symptoms appearing on possible mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ie , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ f@@ ern@@ ing heart@@ burn and prescri@@ be medical advice ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 The risk of serious adverse events seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly , and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that refer to a mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient , and can be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while in large clinical trials with al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate no increased risk was observed , some severe and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and with complications , are reported ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis of the jaw , usually in connection with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including o@@ ste@@ opathy ) , was reported in cancer patients , containing bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are no data available to give notice of whether the Ab@@ use of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ otherapy in patients receiving a surgical surgical procedure reduces the risk of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis of the jaw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clinical assessment by the treated physician is author@@ itative for therapy planning for each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be dependent on the intake of taking a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the tablet in the next morning , after being noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you should not take two tablets a day , but the intake of one tablet a week , as originally planned at the planned week@@ day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other diseases affecting the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated adequate before the therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate food and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral drugs can affect the absorption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate if they are taken at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , patients after taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although specific interaction studies were not performed , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines , without clin@@ ically relevant interaction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for application with post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and therefore ought to be either avoided by pregnant women or pregnant women .
animal studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate don &apos;t allow any clu@@ e to recognize directly harmful effects regarding the pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis of the jaw was reported in patients under bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports originate from cancer patients but also reported to o@@ steopor@@ osis .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate as a result of an oral over@@ dose may occur with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ thal@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract , so@@ d@@ oni@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the main effect of 1.@@ 25 @-@ Di@@ hydro@@ xy@@ gen D3 is the increase of the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosph@@ ate as well as the regulation of calcium calcium and the ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in severe cases , a deficiency could lead to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ onist , weak@@ nesses of the proxim@@ al mus@@ cul@@ ature and o@@ ste@@ om@@ al@@ az@@ ie and thus further increased risk for ap@@ ron and bone qu@@ arri@@ es in o@@ steopor@@ osis persons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the BM@@ D of the spinal column and the Tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to keep the BM@@ D of the Fem@@ ale and the entire body was maintained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fit consisted of two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials per day ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily , either over 1 or 2 years ) was taken : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this study the daily gift of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate 7.9 % compared to Pla@@ z@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in o@@ steopor@@ osis studies , al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was effective if at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drinking of the day was taken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in healthy subjects , the gift of oral Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day ) was not a clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ avail@@ abil@@ ity@@ ( increase in range from 20 % to 44 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
9 distribution studies in rats have resulted that al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate is temporarily distributed in turn@@ out tissue by intraven@@ ous gift of 1 mg / kg and then divided into the bones or eliminated with urine .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted over the acid or basic transport system of the kidneys , and therefore it is not assumed that it is influenced by humans the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; character@@ is@@ tika with patient pre@@ clinical trials have shown that the proportion of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate that is not stored in bone , quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted over the urine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there is no clinical data about it , nevertheless the ren@@ al elim@@ ination of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate as in the animal experiments should be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , in patients with reduced kidney function a slightly increased pain of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate in the bone can be expected ( see paragraph 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tablets are available in a rectangular , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 270 &quot; on the other side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adv@@ ances is given to adult patients , to which a kidney or liver was transplan@@ ted to prevent a loss of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Progra@@ f / Progra@@ mmer is already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously carried out studies using Progra@@ f / Progra@@ mmer , as well as data from published literature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the results of a clinical study of 6@@ 68 patients were presented with kidney transplan@@ tation which was compared with Progra@@ f / Progra@@ f or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main indic@@ ative of the efficacy was the number of patients with which the transplan@@ t was crashed after a treatment duration of one year ( by example , a re @-@ transplan@@ t transplan@@ t or a re@@ acting of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , more recent studies of 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients were performed with liver transplan@@ tation and examined as Adv@@ ant@@ f in comparison to Progra@@ f / Progra@@ ft from the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tre@@ mor ( cit@@ tern ) , head@@ aches , nau@@ sea / vom@@ iting , diarr@@ he@@ a ( hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ) , diabetes , increased potassium content of blood ( hypertension ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( In@@ som@@ nia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with fat sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ lid antibiotics ( such as er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or one of the other ingredients may not be applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients and doctors will be careful when others ( especially several herbal ) medicines are taken at the same time with adv@@ ances , since the adv@@ ent dose may be adapted accordingly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard capsules , ret@@ ard@@ ly yellow @-@ orange gel@@ atine capsules , printed in red ink on the light yellow capsule part with &quot; 4,@@ 6@@ 47 &quot; ; they contain white powder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only physi@@ cians who are familiar with the immun@@ os@@ ur@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ tation patients , should prescri@@ be medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ supp@@ res@@ sive therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the system@@ ic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this may lead to gra@@ ft sho@@ cks or to an increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immune system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and appropriate daily dosage ; ren@@ dition of the formulation or regime should only be performed under the nar@@ row@@ ful control of a medical doctor &apos;s transplan@@ tation ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a result of conversion to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic pharmaceutical surveillance and appropriate dose adjustment must be carried out to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can remain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adv@@ ances should be primarily based on clinical assessment of im@@ po@@ uring and toler@@ ability in individual cases , and on blood levels ( see below &quot; Rec@@ ommen@@ dations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after conversion from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus talents should be controlled before switching and over two weeks after conversion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Day 4 the system@@ ic exposure was measured with both form@@ ulations , with both form@@ ul@@ ls and le@@ op@@ ted patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
careful and repeated checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ mud are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation in advance according to correct substance exposition in the immediate after@@ care phase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with lower Clear@@ ance , an adaptation of the advance can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State can be reached . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case the patient does not allow patients in the first postoperative phase , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus therapy can be administered intraven@@ ously ( Progra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate on the production of in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
duration of the use In the suppression of transplan@@ tation ensu@@ es must not be specified . consequently a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dose visits - kidney transplan@@ tation and proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ ts . oral Adv@@ ant@@ ment therapy should start at 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
further dose adjustment can be later necessary because the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of stabil@@ isation of the patient after transplan@@ tation .
dose recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation of proph@@ yla@@ xis The oral Adv@@ ant@@ ment therapy should start at 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dos@@ age recommendation - switch from Progra@@ f on Adv@@ ant@@ f is a transplan@@ ts made of twice daily dose of Progra@@ f capsules to once daily taking daily intake , thus to take place on the entire daily dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After a change@@ over from other immun@@ os@@ supp@@ ress@@ ants to adv@@ ances once daily must begin the treatment with each dose of kidney transplan@@ tation recommended for proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ tation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heart transplan@@ tation In cases of adult patients , aimed at adv@@ ances , is an oral Initi@@ al dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day daily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other transplan@@ ts received no clinical experience with adv@@ ances in lung and pan@@ cre@@ ta treatment in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in an oral initi@@ ate dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in an oral initi@@ ate dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function In the targeted field , can be required in patients with severe liver failure to minim@@ ise the dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients with reduced kidney function , when the kidney function had no influence on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , due to the ne@@ p@@ hr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , a careful monitoring of the kidneys ( including a regular determination of the ser@@ um @-@ in@@ oids , and monitoring of the urine volume ) is recommended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
change of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in on Adv@@ ant@@ ment At the change@@ over from a Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy is careful ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dose should be taken primarily on the clinical assessment of im@@ po@@ uring and toler@@ ability in the individual case under sub@@ stra@@ pping of whole blood @-@ tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus talents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus talents during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by periodi@@ c insp@@ ections during maintenance therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also change according to transition from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , Dos@@ age adjustments , changes in the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change blood sugar ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Advent is a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , the dose may take several days until the Ste@@ ady State can occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the data in clinical trials allow that a successful treatment is possible in most cases , if the tal@@ low should not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in clinical practice the top@@ ical mirror of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are usually found in the first time according to liver transplan@@ tation in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and transplan@@ t patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t were usually used in the range of blood pressure concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has led to severe adverse events , including gra@@ fts , or any other side effects that occur in sequence of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or over@@ exposure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and appropriate daily dosage ; ren@@ dition of the formulation or regime should only be performed under the nar@@ row@@ ful control of a medical doctor &apos;s transplan@@ tation ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ ts , which proved to be treated with other immun@@ os@@ supp@@ ress@@ ants , are still no clinical data for ret@@ ard@@ ating formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ fts in adult heart transplan@@ ts and gra@@ fts in the Kind@@ es@@ age are not yet any clinical data for ret@@ ard@@ ant formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to possible inter@@ actions that can lead to a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ muscle levels in the blood and a short@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ intestinal ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other plant ingredients during treatment with adv@@ ances ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in patients with diarr@@ ho@@ ea a particularly careful monitoring of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - concentrations in the blood has been offered because the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subjected to considerable variation in such circumstances .
in rare cases the chamber or Sept@@ um@@ hyper@@ trop@@ h@@ ie referred to as a cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was observed that therefore may also occur below adv@@ ances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders , are an already existing heart disease , high blood pressure , kidney or liver failure , infections , fluid transfer and o@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like other immun@@ os@@ supp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted by suitable clothing or use of a sun protection using a high protection factor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if patients who capture tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms of res like head@@ ache , changed unit of consciousness , cra@@ mps and sin@@ tering , should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because adv@@ ent hard capsules , ret@@ ard@@ ants , l@@ act@@ ose , is in patients with the rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , l@@ act@@ ase deficiency , or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ ign@@ ation special caution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the simultaneous application of medicines or herbal remedi@@ es , which are known as inhibit@@ ors or induction of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , can increase or decrease the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it is advisable to change the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ muscle blood levels at the same gift of substances that allow the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism to maintain and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dosage to maintaining uniform levels ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a strong effect was made with anti@@ fung@@ al agents like K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and Vor@@ ic@@ on@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ id antibiot@@ ic er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV Prot@@ ease In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors ( z ) .
Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies found that the increase of blood levels resulted from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by the in@@ hibition of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal injection .
high @-@ dose pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one how to increase or decrease the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as CY@@ P3@@ A4 . therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be met@@ aboli@@ zed by CY@@ P3@@ A4 , which metabolism may inter@@ f@@ ere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dis@@ gu@@ ise the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid @-@ contra@@ cep@@ tives , and thus increasing the hormone exposure , is particularly careful to deal with emp@@ tive measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clearing of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and can extend their half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the results of a low number of examinations in transplan@@ tation patients do not provide evidence that under tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus an increased risk of unwanted events , with regard to the course and result of pregnancy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in uter@@ o exposition a monitoring of the new@@ bor@@ ns on possible harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially regarding its effect on kidneys ) is recommended .
there is a risk of early birth ( &lt; Week 37 ) and an hyper@@ inf@@ ant of new@@ bor@@ ns ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns ) :
the profile @-@ effective profile of immun@@ os@@ supp@@ ress@@ ants can often be found exactly because of the under@@ going disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and a high binding of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma samples , the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can not di@@ aly@@ zed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the effects of action and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on molecular levels can be convey@@ ed by its ties to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ical protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the nucle@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent inhibit@@ ing of signals in the T cell , thereby preventing the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; overall , the safety profile of oral Progra@@ f in these published studies observed the observ@@ ations in the large studies where Progra@@ f with liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t were responsive to primary immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an intermediate analysis in an intermediate analysis over a recently conducted multi @-@ cent@@ ric study with oral Progra@@ f has been reported over 110 patients who received either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in during a 1 : 1 Rand@@ om@@ ization .
a chronic gra@@ fts of the bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ate syndrome was also less frequently observed in the first year after transplan@@ tation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8,@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after a year was 80@@ ,@@ 8 % in the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - and 83 % in the Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in cases of patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , there came to 2@@ 1.7 % of cases coming to the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ine compared to 3@@ 8.0 % under Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0,@@ 0@@ 25 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the number of cases where Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed on tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 0.@@ 02 ) as the number of patients who have been converted by tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) .
the number of cases observed in which there was not an acc@@ laim@@ ed transplan@@ ts after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in response transplan@@ t patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study the frequency of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ine disease was significantly lower in patients with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus patients .
pan@@ cre@@ atic transplan@@ tation A multi @-@ cent@@ ric study with oral Progra@@ f was carried out in 205 patients who were treated at the same time with a random@@ ised procedure Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral Initi@@ al Initi@@ al ( by protocol ) from Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and thereafter was reached after reaching the targeted talents of 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml per day .
the published clinical results from a mon@@ oc@@ entri@@ c study with oral Progra@@ f with oral Progra@@ f showed in 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ines and col@@ o@@ rec@@ tal transplan@@ ts ) below Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 25 mul@@ tiv@@ is@@ cer@@ al transplan@@ ts ) under tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 25 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as a low hem@@ at@@ ocy@@ tes and low protein group concentrations lead to an increase in the found faction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or an increase of metast@@ asis was responsible for transplan@@ tation observed after transplan@@ tation observed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely met@@ aboli@@ zed almost entirely , with ex@@ cre@@ tion above all occurs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of stable patients , offered by Progra@@ f ( twice daily ) in relation to the overall daily dose , the system@@ ic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was nearly 10 % lower than before Progra@@ f . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus talents during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by periodi@@ c insp@@ ections during maintenance therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 21 For the treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ ts , which proved to be treated with other immun@@ os@@ supp@@ ress@@ ants , are still no clinical data to ret@@ ard@@ ant formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Adv@@ ances is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding associated with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the dose and frequency of the application , Adv@@ ance is employed for the treatment of bleeding or prevention of blood vessels during surgical intervention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency , which caused blood cl@@ ot@@ ation problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but is produced using a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is produced by a cell , into which a gene ( DNA ) was brought to the formation of the human scent factor VIII . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Adv@@ ance is a different medicine approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but it does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was investigated for prevention of bleeding and with surgical intervention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the main study the effectiveness of Adv@@ ances in the prevention of bleeding was awarded with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; excellent &quot; with the prevention of bleeding in 86 % .
the most common adverse events ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of anti@@ bodies against factor VIII .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adv@@ ance may not be applied in patients who may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) against the human scent factor VIII , Maus@@ oleum or Ham@@ ster@@ protein or any of the other ingredients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission approved the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG for the placing of interest in the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dosage : dose and duration of the sub@@ stitution step is according to the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII , according to the place and the degree of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the following trop@@ hi@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor VIII activity in the corresponding period is not likely to fall under the indicated plasma level of plastic ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ U. / l ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours for patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or for longer repeated until the pain and acute attacks are removed .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours for patients under 6 years ) are repeated until the risk is over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the treatment , it is recommended to control the dose of inj@@ ections and the frequency of the inj@@ ections of VIII . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; individual patients can differ in their response to factor VIII , varying in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis For long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VIII per kilogra@@ m of body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the expected factor VIII can not be achieved , or if the bleeding is un@@ controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be performed to prove to an inhibit@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective that other therapeutic interventions must be considered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appointment should be set by the patient , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing anti@@ bodies against factor VIII is a well @-@ known comp@@ lication in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always directed against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII by Ig@@ G Imm@@ ac@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine that were quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using the modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the risk , inhibit@@ ors to develop , cor@@ rel@@ ates with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk depends on the greatest and other factors within the first 20 Ex@@ pres@@ sive days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ positions and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically well known In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ory development was observed after the change@@ over from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII to another that re@@ occur ( low@@ ti@@ tri@@ gen ) inhibit@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the rare occurrence of the ha@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A in women , no experiences are required during pregnancy and lac@@ tation period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the greatest number of patients occurring A@@ DR@@ s were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) which have treated previously un@@ treated patients , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever , and di@@ zz@@ iness ( in each case 3 patients ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , very rare ( frequency on the basis of available data not in@@ valuable ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of individual patients ( 234 ) . the unexpected waste of blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els occurred within a patient with continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
the bleeding was maintained throughout the whole period and both the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirror in the plasma and the Clear@@ ance Rate showed sufficient values on 15 post operative day .
for clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE to 145 children and adults with prior exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient in 26 ex@@ positions with A@@ DV@@ ATE showed a low inhibit@@ ory ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
in addition to no of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed with moderate to moderate hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) an F@@ VIII @-@ inhibit@@ or was established .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in previously un@@ treated patients from a continuous clinical trial , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE are treated In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors against factor VIII . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immune response of patients to traces of contamination protein was analysed by the investigation of anti@@ bodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one patient had a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend for anti @-@ Ch@@ o cell membran@@ es , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms related to an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in four patients the occurrence of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ es Gran@@ u@@ lo@@ tes reported on several repeti@@ tive product ex@@ positions in the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ ATE has been reported on hyper@@ sensitive type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ to@@ i@@ der reactions ( frequency not known ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the activated factor VIII acts as a factor for the activated Fac@@ tor IX and accelerates the formation of activated carbon X from factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE were performed in previously treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( base value of the Fac@@ tor VIII @-@ Activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters come from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 100 previously treated patients or &gt; 10 years and are listed in the table below 3 .

each single pack consists of a water bottle with powder , a pier@@ cing tank with 5 ml liquid ( both glass Type I with chlor@@ ob@@ ut@@ yl rubber stamps ) and a device for reconstruction ( BA@@ X@@ J@@ ECT II ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the product is still stored in the refrigerator , remove both jum@@ per bottles with A@@ DV@@ ATE powder and solvents from the refrigerator and warm up at room temperature ( between 15 and 25 ° C ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a significant increase in pulse rate can be slow@@ ed down , or temporarily down the injection of inj@@ ections ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the data available since the first application , the CH@@ MP has remained positively evaluated than positive , but also considered the safety profile of the following reasons must be closely monitored : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , CH@@ MP has thus made a further extension procedure on the basis of the security profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which is required for filing an additional extension procedure in 5 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited , the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) officially accepted the company &apos;s request to permit for the treatment of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the breast , the bones , bone or soft parts ( tissue that combines other structures in the body , and relies on ) it is affected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a type of virus , which was gene@@ tically modified that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in , it is a Aden@@ ov@@ irus , which has been changed so that there are no copies of itself , and therefore no infections can resolve in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adv@@ ex@@ in would have inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors , and to enable the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the p@@ 53 gene , which is formed from the non @-@ defective body of existing p@@ 53 gene , usually contributes to restoration damaged DNA and to kill cells when DNA can not be recovered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , with which the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein is not working properly , and the cancer cells may grow further and share . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company placed data from a study involving thousands of patients with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of sub@@ building , in the bones and in the brain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the CH@@ MP has examined the questions posed on the questions , there were still some issues un@@ solved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the initial documents , the CH@@ MP grants a list of questions which will be sent to the company by day 120 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the CH@@ MP , the injection of Adv@@ antage in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors has proved benefits to patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the committee had concerns regarding the processing of drugs in the body , type of administration and safety of medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the company had not yet proven that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be made in reliable manner and that there is neither the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CH@@ MP is not having knowledge of whether the withdrawal of patients has currently taking part in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed mode release , means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective components are immediately released and the other slowly is released over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( ha@@ y fever , by allergy to pol@@ len ) in patients with nose syndrome ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for adults and adolescents 12 years the recommended dose of a@@ a@@ a@@ ze is twice daily , which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and end as soon as symptoms , especially the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medication can be re@@ directed to con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main dimensions of the sever@@ ity were the changes in the sever@@ ity of hypo@@ cr@@ ushing symptoms , which were reported by the patients before the beginning of treatment and during 15 @-@ day treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the study , patients showed their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and valu@@ ate the symptoms in the last 12 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in consideration of all ha@@ y fever symptoms , except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose the patients reported an increase in symptoms of 4@@ 6.0 % , compared with 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients receiving p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients showed under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a reduction of symptoms of 3@@ 7.4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients suffering from the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ ma ( appetite , head@@ ache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence , sleep disorders , and nerv@@ ousness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for patients who may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or one of the other ingredients , against ad@@ ren@@ er@@ ous compounds or lau@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( another medicine for the treatment of allergi@@ es ) , cannot be applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aero@@ in@@ a@@ ze may also not be applied to patients who suffer from a Eng@@ angle glaucoma ( hypertension ) , cer@@ vical or v@@ ascular diseases ( hypertension ) or have a reduction of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued an approval for the shipping of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , is to swallow whole ( i.e. without bite to break or ch@@ ew ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used by the lack of data on harm@@ less@@ ness and effectiveness ( see Section 5.1 ) for children under 12 years of age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the duration of the application is as short as possible , and should not continue after the sound of the symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days as with long @-@ term application the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine can take time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a decline in sw@@ elling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory tract , treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in as mon@@ otherapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine contains , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients who are treated with mon@@ oc@@ amin@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety and efficacy of these combination therapy were not audi@@ tory , and the data do not suff@@ ice to supply appropriate recommendations for the dosage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver failure , and the data are not sufficient to supply appropriate recommendations for dosage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients need to be informed that treatment in the occurrence of hypertension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ ate or of pal@@ pit@@ ations , ar@@ rhyth@@ mic disorders , nau@@ sea , or any event@@ ual other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( such as head@@ ache or a ampli@@ fication of the head@@ ache ) must be stopped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the treatment of the following patient groups we will be approached with caution : • Pati@@ ents with heart rhythm disorders • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder construction or bron@@ chi@@ os@@ pas@@ m in An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze has at least 48 hours before serving the mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines can prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin actions or reduce their extent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in the context of clinical trials involving Tri@@ fi@@ at@@ ad@@ in where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given , no clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions or changes of plasma concentration have been observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the results of psych@@ omot@@ or testing , no significant differences between the patients treated with the disin@@ teg@@ at@@ ad@@ in and the plac@@ ebo treated with plac@@ ebo have been taken alone or with alcohol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this enzyme has not yet been identified for the metabolism of lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , so that inter@@ actions with other medicines may not be excluded entirely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deser@@ ters in vi@@ vo CY@@ P3@@ A4 not inhi@@ bit , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bits and does not inhi@@ bit the inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ consistency of the application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , no increase in frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to frequency in normal population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because territory studies of animals are not always transferred to humans , and for the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ctor properties of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine should not be used in pregnancy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the patients should be clari@@ fied , however , that in very rare cases it can come to a di@@ zz@@ iness , which can lead to a draw@@ back of machines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; symptoms vary between a CN@@ S @-@ depression ( dation , ap@@ ne@@ e , reduced mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular col@@ lagen , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible le@@ ases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a CN@@ S stimulation is particularly prob@@ able with children , as well as At@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth drying , pup@@ il size , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these include both the inhibit@@ ing of inflam@@ mat@@ ory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ es such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mac@@ ular cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ s and expression of the expression of expression of the hem@@ i@@ od@@ ine molec@@ ule P sel@@ ec@@ ule on end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an individual dose study of adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed no effect on standard measuring values , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective sle@@ ep@@ iness or the tasks that are connected to the bow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in controlled clinical trials , a daily dosage of 5 mg daily increased no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess in comparison to plac@@ ebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the oral application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can produce more sympath@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase of blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ ate or manifestation of a CN@@ S ar@@ ous@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it took 1.@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 , with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , with 4@@ 14 patients aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both trials , the hist@@ am@@ ant@@ agon@@ istic efficacy of aero@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets determined significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 weeks treatment time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effectiveness of aero@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the fluctu@@ ating effect , determines from the nose @-@ breaking effect , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with a lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in over the 2 weeks treatment time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effectiveness of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic origin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of a single @-@ dose study for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze , the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is veri@@ fi@@ able within 30 minutes after administration in the plasma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the per@@ oral application of aero@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow@@ ed balance of lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dos@@ cope study , which was conducted with formulation as a tablet of healthy adult volunteers , was found that four subjects were disin@@ teg@@ rating badly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) from p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine based on the sole gift of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was made of exposure to the gift of an Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on conventional concepts for safety pharmac@@ ology , to tox@@ icity , on the tox@@ icity of re@@ do@@ x tox@@ icity and for reproduction , the pre@@ clinical data with the di@@ chlor@@ at@@ ad@@ in does not recognize any haz@@ ards for human beings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the combination had no greater tox@@ icity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredients P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in re@@ productive neuro@@ ological studies the combination of bay ad@@ in / p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ med up to 120 mg / kg / day and per rab@@ bit in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; March 2007 and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application application is established , and works before and while the product is on the market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the reli@@ eving of allergic symptoms , by preventing hist@@ amine that can un@@ fold its own substance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets include symptoms that occur in connection with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( ha@@ y fever ) , such as ni@@ esen , current or ju@@ st@@ ling eyes , while con@@ sti@@ ff@@ ing or ju@@ stly eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

taking Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or if it is not prescribed for prescri@@ ption medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the recommended dosage , the recommended dosage means that Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze leads to di@@ zz@@ iness or disp@@ ose of attention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , you should immediately use your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you should have taken a bigger amount of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have forgotten the intake of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze If you have forgotten to take a dose in time , get your application as soon as possible and turn the next dose at the required moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects will affect you significantly , or you may notice any side effects listed in this manual information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

it is available as a 5 mg tray , 5 m@@ g@@ - and 5 m@@ g@@ - and 5 mg fusion tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) and 0,5 mg / ml @-@ syrup and as per 0.5 mg / ml solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , in the form of 2.5 ml of syrup or respectively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml syrup or respectively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ eri@@ us was examined in eight studies of about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( among which four studies with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and two studies of patients , which had also asthma ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; efficacy was measured by the change of symptoms ( it@@ ching , count and size of squares , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on days ) before and after six weeks of treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were further studies submitted to prove that the body uses the syrup , the solution to capture and the hot tablets in the same manner , as the tablets and the application of children is harmless . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , if the results of all studies were taken with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us to an average decrease of the symp@@ tom ( symptoms score ) by 25 to 26 % compared to the patients who received a plac@@ ebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the two trials at Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the decrease of the symptoms after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to 40 and 33 % compared to plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us may not be applied in patients who may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in or lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine or one of the other ingredients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission issued an approval for the inclusion of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to reli@@ eving symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and per@@ s@@ istic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are limited experience from clinical trials on effectiveness in the application of deser@@ ters from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ances allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( symptoms of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be terminated according to the end of the disease , and after their return the symptoms can be res@@ umed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( symptoms of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks ) , patients can be recommended during the worse period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were reported in the framework of clinical trials involving di@@ chlor@@ at@@ ad@@ in tablets at which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , associated in@@ ges@@ tion of alcohol and alcohol was not enhanced ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , patients should be clari@@ fied in the fact that in very rare cases it can lead to an impair@@ ment or the ability to serve machines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials in different indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common adverse events that were reported more often than in plac@@ ebo , fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , mouth @-@ dried ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.6 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 young young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most frequent adverse head@@ aches , who were treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , were treated with 6,@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a multiple @-@ dose study , which were administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) were observed not clin@@ ically relevant effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes both the in@@ hibition of inflam@@ mat@@ ory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ es such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mac@@ ular cells / bas@@ op@@ hi@@ es as well as the expression of the expression of the hem@@ i@@ od@@ ine molec@@ ule P sel@@ ec@@ ule on end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple outlets , administered during a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statistical or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , which has been given a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with an individual dos@@ e- study of adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed no effect on standard measuring values , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective sle@@ ep@@ iness or the tasks that are connected to the bow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching and redness of the eyes and it@@ ching on the palate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ en@@ ni@@ al , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis may be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , or in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an unusual or allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as the symptoms of 4 or more days a week , more than 4 weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as shown on the overall quality of life at r@@ hin@@ o jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces diseases caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was in@@ quired for further forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ ology is ir@@ respective of the different forms and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the hist@@ am@@ orph@@ an@@ ism is a caus@@ al factor in all pre@@ tik@@ ari@@ al diseases , that des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in is also expected to improve symptoms in other forms of the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Sco@@ tik@@ aria A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose @-@ gap .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines at the chronic idi@@ opathic Sco@@ tik@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines from the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an improvement in the target of more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of patients treated with the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in treated patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and growth , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evalu@@ ating these variables . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients were comparable with the general seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis of population , was achieved in 4 % of patients a higher concentration of lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are no clu@@ es for a clin@@ ically relevant Kum@@ ulation after a daily use of lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of deser@@ ters was not yet identified so that inter@@ actions with other medicines are not completely excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disin@@ teg@@ at@@ ad@@ in inhi@@ bits no CY@@ P3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bits , neither a substrate yet another inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a single dos@@ sh@@ ad@@ ine with a distill@@ ate in a dosage of 7.5 mg , meals ( gre@@ asy , rich breakfast ) does not affect the availability of lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a comparable degree of exposition of the disin@@ ter@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , there were no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the tox@@ icity profile of lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on conventional concepts for safety pharmac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated declar@@ atory , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and for reproduction , the pre@@ clinical data with the disin@@ ter@@ at@@ ad@@ in does not recognize any haz@@ ards for human beings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; color@@ less film ( contains l@@ act@@ ose mon@@ ohydr@@ ate , Hy@@ pro@@ m@@ less , titanium dioxide , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 , In@@ dig@@ o@@ car@@ min ( E 132 ) ) , car@@ nau@@ ba@@ gel , soft wax . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us can be taken regardless of meals , to prevent symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and per@@ s@@ istic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the missing doctor should be aware that most cases of r@@ hin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see Section 4.4 ) and that no data is available , which support a treatment of inf@@ anti@@ le r@@ hin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ic an@@ om@@ ali@@ es should play a role in diagnosis , physical research and appropriate laboratory and skin tests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of met@@ aboli@@ ze is reduced to a higher sub@@ stress ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children between the ages of 2 and 11 have limited to met@@ aboli@@ zed , is identical with the children that met@@ aboli@@ ze normally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this medicine contains sac@@ char@@ ose and Sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose deficiency may not be taken .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not found in clinical trials involving A@@ eri@@ us tablets at which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , associated with intake of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol was not enhanced ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up Group was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up Group , similar to the plac@@ ebo group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in different indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a multiple dose study of adults and adolescents , at which up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) were observed , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children aged between 1 and 11 years , received a daily disin@@ formation dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the evolution of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Sco@@ tik@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in adults and children can be extra@@ pol@@ ated by the absorption data of lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in adults on the children &apos;s population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple outlets in adults and teenagers , employed in a dose of up to 20 mg daily , no statistical or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study on adults and adolescents , having been used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( Ne@@ un@@ fold the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , there was no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in controlled clinical trials , a recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents has no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess in comparison to plac@@ ebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an individual daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets led in adults and adolescents to no impair@@ ment of psych@@ omot@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies of adults , it was not affected by the simultaneous intake of alcohol to an increase of alcohol in@@ surg@@ ents nor an increase of drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in adult and you@@ thful patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms like s@@ thes@@ es , nas@@ al secre@@ tion , tear and redness of the eyes and it@@ ching on the palate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as shown on the overall quality of quality of life at r@@ hin@@ o jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , As@@ eri@@ us tablets are effective that caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Sco@@ tik@@ aria A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose @-@ gap .
the spread of this natural met@@ aboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults + 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ sia ( 2 % adults + 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the syrup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis which have limited to met@@ aboli@@ tion .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in was approximately 6@@ mal higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ max is about 3 to 4 times higher with a season half @-@ time of approximately 120 hours .
there are no clu@@ es for a clin@@ ically relevant drug comp@@ ulation after a daily use of lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various individual dose studies reported that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in showed at the recommended doses were comparable with those of adults who received the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in syrup in a dose of 5 mg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of deser@@ ters was not yet identified so that inter@@ actions with other medicines may not be excluded entirely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately before the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ op@@ hil@@ ari@@ ats must be taken out without damaging them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets at which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally used ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials in different indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets that were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a multiple @-@ dose study , which were used up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in two individual dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at was well toler@@ ated and documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple sockets , measured in a dose of up to 20 mg daily , no statistical or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , which has been applied to a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in controlled clinical trials , a daily dosage of 5 mg daily increased no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess in comparison to plac@@ ebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a 17 single dose study of adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed no effect on standard values of the flow of fluids including the ampli@@ fication of subjective sle@@ ep@@ iness or the tasks that are connected to the bow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching and redness of the eyes and it@@ ching on the palate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

there are limited experience from clinical trials on effectiveness in the application of deser@@ ters from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of hot tablets are taken out without damaging them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the efficacy and integrity of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg has not been detected in the treatment of children under 6 years of age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the overall stability of the side effects between the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine syrup and the plac@@ eb@@ ral group was equal , and departed not significantly from the safety profile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us fusion tablets proved to be organic equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate formulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple outlets , measured in a dose of up to 20 mg daily , no statistical or clin@@ ically significant was observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the overall stability of the side effects in children between the ages of 2 and 11 was similar to the disin@@ teg@@ at@@ ad@@ in group , similar to the plac@@ ebo group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for infants between 6 and 23 months the most common adverse events were reported , more than the common than in plac@@ ebo , diarr@@ ho@@ e ( 3,7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ( 2.3 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an additional study , 2.5 mg of the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine solution were observed at an immer@@ sive dose of patients at the age of 6 and 11 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the recommended doses the plasma concentrations of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in the kinder@@ garten and adult population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in controlled clinical trials , a recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents has no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess in comparison to plac@@ ebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ en@@ ni@@ al , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis may vary depending on the duration of the symptoms , or in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the 150 ml package size is a measuring spoon or application sp@@ ills for use with scal@@ ating of 2.5 ML@@ C and 5 ml doses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially accepted the committee for Human Use of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to the prevention of avi@@ ar H@@ 5@@ N1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be applied in adults and elderly people against flu , which is caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of influ@@ enza @-@ A virus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a special kind of vaccine which might cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic to protect a future pan@@ de@@ mic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a influ@@ enza pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus appears , which can easily spread from man to person , because people still have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) against it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the vaccine identi@@ fies the immune system contained in the vaccine contained in the vaccine as &quot; physical alien &quot; and prevents anti@@ bodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this makes the immune system later , in a contact with an influ@@ enza of that pedi@@ ms to form rapid antibody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; afterwards , the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ m of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface ) separated , puri@@ fied , puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inspection of some of the study sites prove that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thereby , the extent of clinical data base for evalu@@ ating the safety of the vaccine is not sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the guidelines of the EMEA ( EMEA ) vacc@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should you take part in clinical testing and need further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you wish further information regarding the recommendations of the CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of EP@@ AR ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the Human Immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( HIV ) , which are infected with the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , ag@@ ase is indeed available as a solution for use , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r since the safety of this combination was not examined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ag@@ ase should only be prescribed then if the doctor has taken , which has taken up the anti@@ viral medicines in the patient , and the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood is judged that the virus is cont@@ ested against the medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , taken together with twice daily 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other anti@@ viral drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ oil is based on body weight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , A@@ ha@@ ase reduces the HIV content in blood and holds it on a low level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AIDS is not to cure , however , the damage of the immune system can thus far go beyond the development of AIDS associated infections and diseases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , however , without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , performed in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who were previously un@@ treated with Prot@@ ease In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the drug regim@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced drug as@@ generators was compared at 206 adults who had used previously Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ i@@ tions , compared with other Prot@@ ease In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main indic@@ ator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ veri@@ fi@@ able concentrations of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ us@@ last ) , or the change in viral load according to the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study involving patients who had taken no prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ a had taken a viral load under 400 copies / ml as under plac@@ ebo , but as@@ generators were less effective than In@@ j@@ avi@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in children , A@@ la@@ ase also reduced the virus , but of the children who were treated earlier with Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ iah , were very few on the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study of adults who were treated earlier with Prot@@ e@@ as@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , dealing with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced medicines A@@ ha@@ ase after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other Prot@@ ease of Prot@@ ease : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other proteins , it came together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of viral load after four weeks as in the patients whose previous Prot@@ ease of hi@@ bit@@ ors continued to : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common side effects of A@@ ha@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( diarr@@ he@@ a ) , sea sea ( nau@@ sea ) . vom@@ iting , skin rash and Fati@@ gue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ la@@ ase must not be applied in patients who may possibly be in@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against am@@ bo@@ ar or any of the other ingredients .
ag@@ asy may also not be applied in patients who are degra@@ ded to cur@@ rants ( an herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or drugs that are equally affected as A@@ la@@ ase and are taken in high concentrations in the blood health .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like with other medicines against HIV , the risk of a body fat ( changes in the distribution of the body fat ) , an o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ tom@@ y ( symptoms of infection , caused by the rest@@ ful immune system ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs , the Committee for Human Diagnos@@ is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ag@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee established that the benefits of as@@ tic@@ ase is taken in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had never been captured as a prot@@ ector . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ ha@@ ase was originally registered under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , &quot; at the time the approval of scientific reasons only limited information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission issued G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited for placing the transport of ads in the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- infected , Prot@@ ease of adults and children aged 4 years and older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually , A@@ ha@@ ase capsules should be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic fe@@ at of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use of amp@@ hy@@ b@@ r should take place under consideration of the individual viral resistance and treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take up is 14 % less than capsule ; therefore A@@ generating capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable to one milli@@ grams per milli@@ grams ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for as@@ generators capsules is 600 mg of Am@@ mel@@ avi@@ r twice daily with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2 If A@@ ha@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fied addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sted ) , higher doses of ag@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recommended dose for ag@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily total dose of 2400 mg Am@@ os@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of ag@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other Prot@@ ease In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors were not studied for children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ag@@ ase is not recommended for the use with children under 4 years of age due to the lack of data for the in@@ consistency and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with heavy liver failure to 300 mg twice daily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the simultaneous application is to be contra@@ indicated in patients with light or excessive liver failure when patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ag@@ ase may not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P3@@ A4 ) .
vegetable preparations containing cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of amp@@ hy@@ b@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be advised that atri@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy cannot lead to an infection of HIV infection , and that they may continue to develop opport@@ un@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with ag@@ ase prevents the risk of transmission of HIV on others by sexual contact , or contamination with blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually , A@@ ha@@ ase capsules are used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have increased risk of severe liver damage with potentially fatal course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the case of simultaneous treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information about this medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with existing restricted liver function including a chronic @-@ active Hepatitis show increased incidence of liver function distur@@ ban@@ ces under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of as@@ tic@@ ase and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ ular or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids that are not recommended by CY@@ P3@@ A4 ( see Section 4.5 ) for the possible treatment of the risk of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the formation change of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ a @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or of be@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly recommended by CY@@ P3@@ A4 because of elevated risk of risk of Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin which is not recommended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 4 For some medicines that cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , like carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in , are available methods for determining the substance concentration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for patients who take these drugs at the same time , A@@ la@@ ase may be less effective due to reduced plasma level of amp@@ hy@@ per cent ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the possibility of metabolic exchange with Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tives may be changed , however the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of inter@@ actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when meth@@ ad@@ on is given at the same time with Am@@ ber@@ j@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored in op@@ at@@ ent@@ aries symptoms , especially if there are still low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the potential risk of a tox@@ icity , this Dar@@ reich@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated for children under one age of four years , should be applied with caution at certain other patient groups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ag@@ ase should be set in duration 5 when a rash of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see Section 4.8 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ iah , was reported using the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an ex@@ az@@ her@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of the patients had other diseases associated with their therapy medications , associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B. higher age , and with drug addic@@ ts , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with ha@@ em@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors ( type A and B ) , which were treated with Prot@@ e@@ as@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , reports on an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ er@@ thro@@ sis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflam@@ mat@@ ous reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or re@@ mod@@ al opport@@ un@@ istic infections , which lead to severe clinical states or deteri@@ oration of symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is adopted ( among them the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol use , severe immun@@ os@@ cope , higher body mass index ) , were reported in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
CY@@ P3@@ A4 Sub@@ strate with low therapeutic la@@ vis@@ ors may not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with a low therapeutic width of as@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be joined together with medicines that are primarily connected to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and are linked to increased plasma tor@@ ch with severe and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % decrease in AU@@ C of Am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical understanding and a resistance of resistance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in attemp@@ ting to compens@@ ate the hum@@ bled plasma tor@@ ch in combination with Rit@@ or@@ avi@@ r , often unwanted effects were observed at the liver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hyper@@ ic@@ um ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The ser@@ um level of Am@@ mel@@ avi@@ r can be decreased by the simultaneous application of plant preparations with cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a patient is already incorporated at Johann@@ is@@ weed , the am@@ uses are blown up and when possible to vali@@ date the virus and vap@@ ori@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a dose adjustment for any of the medicine is not required if nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r ( see also ef@@ av@@ ir@@ enz below ) .
508 % increase ; for C@@ max it is reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is given in combination with Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and also administered or@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , with efficacy and harm@@ less@@ ness of this mat@@ ri@@ emat@@ ography . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
52 % degra@@ ded when Am@@ mel@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was administered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ mel@@ avi@@ r ( 600 m@@ g. twice daily ) with cal@@ or@@ ra ( 600 m@@ g. of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) were reached , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if am@@ hy@@ lo@@ avi@@ r is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a dosing system for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra may not be given , however , a close monitoring is recommended as the effectiveness and im@@ perfection of this combination is not known . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study conducted for the application of as@@ re@@ ase in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , is recommended for at least one hour due to the anta@@ geous component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why in combination with am@@ av@@ ir@@ enz in combination with Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required .
the treatment with ef@@ av@@ ir@@ enz in combination with Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended because the exposure of both Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ mer would suff@@ ice .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin on other proteins of this and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin may reduce ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ mel@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if these drugs should be used simultaneously , caution is advisable because Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced and possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when these drugs are used together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical supervision should be undertaken as an accurate pre@@ diction of the effect of Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &apos;s combination is difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Am@@ mel@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin resulted in a rise in the plasma concentration of 193 % and thus resulted in a rise in the side effects associated with Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin will be taken along with ag@@ ase in at least half of the recommended dose , though there are no clinical data available for this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with o@@ ases in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin have not been carried out however the plasma level of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ h@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase of the C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole a day which was observed after 200 mg of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole a day without the simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ h@@ az@@ ole by Rit@@ or@@ avi@@ r once daily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other medicines that are listed below are also listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , if they are used together with ag@@ ase , may lead to inter@@ actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should therefore be applied to toxic reactions which are linked to these medicines , if they are applied in combination with ag@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the data of other proteins , it is recommended that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da is not used at the same time as ads , as it can occur to res@@ or@@ ption disorders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ can@@ ines which are known as enzymes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with Am@@ b@@ ass@@ avi@@ r , can lead to a decrease of the plasma tor@@ ch of Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel @-@ block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , di@@ odi@@ pine , di@@ odi@@ pine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; increasing intake with ast@@ ero@@ id can increase their blood concentrations in combination with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disorders and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days were decreased , while end@@ ogen@@ ous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % turn@@ table interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the simultaneous administration of as@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended that the potential benefit of treatment exceeds the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose infection changes greatly increased from CY@@ P3@@ A4 , are expected to expect to increase influ@@ x of orders at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since plasma level increases in these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , including a hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of this medicine is not recommended with Am@@ ber@@ j@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a common monitoring of therapeutic concentrations as well as stabili@@ zation of the mirror , since the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased with the current gift of amp@@ hy@@ b@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , A@@ ha@@ ase must not be used together with oral incorporated mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while using A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution is advisable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors refer to a possible increase in the plasma level of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am to 3- or 4 @-@ times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if meth@@ ad@@ on is administered together with Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored in op@@ at@@ ent@@ aries symptoms , especially if there are still low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the reduced reliability of historic Ver@@ des , no recommendation can be made , as Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with an associated gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with ag@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ) is strongly recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tives is not predic@@ table , therefore alternative methods of contra@@ c@@ eption are recommended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cyc@@ lical anti @-@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example des@@ i@@ pra@@ min and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for the current gift of aging ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied after careful consideration of the possible use of the potential for the mother in comparison to the potential risks for the fet@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the milk of lac@@ tic rats , Am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were not known , however , it is not known whether Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r over@@ rides his breast milk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a reproduction study on pregnant rats who was administered to the U@@ ter@@ us by the end of the lac@@ tation period till the end of the lac@@ tation period showed a decreased increase in the 12 body weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further development of the trace@@ ability , including Fer@@ til@@ isation and Re@@ production capacity was not imp@@ aired by the addition of Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r to the dam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the harm@@ less@@ ness of ag@@ ase has been studied in adults and in children under 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the side @-@ related side @-@ effects associated with ag@@ ase treatment were slightly up to un@@ du@@ ly pronounced , and resulted rarely to treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are used in connection with the intake of as@@ generators or another at the same time to the HIV treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the side @-@ mentioned events originate from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ DU@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) in which patients were not treated twice daily with Prot@@ ease In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) which were standing by the investig@@ ators in connection with the study medicine and performed more than 1 % of the patients as well as in the treatment of occurring lab changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy is associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat , including a loss of peripheral and f@@ skin fatty tissue , increases intra@@ ocular and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ trop@@ h@@ ie of breasts and dor@@ sal fat collection ( p@@ ens ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
among 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment with lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ r in combination with lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ ine / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ in had been treated for a medium term of 36 weeks and was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 presented at 245 NR@@ TI@@ - in previously treated patients under Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) in comparison to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in combination with different NR@@ TI@@ s over a medium term of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.0@@ 001 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; skin rash were usually slightly pronounced , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ry or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ al nature , with or without it@@ ching and disappeared during the second treatment week and disappeared during the second treatment week , without the treatment with Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r had to be ab@@ orted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cases of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis were reported particularly in patients with general known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term application of a anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflam@@ mat@@ ory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or re@@ mod@@ al opport@@ un@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients with PI pre @-@ treated patients who were observed twice daily with low dose of treatment ( degrees 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degree 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degree 2 to 4 ) and of patients , which were treated with low dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were very frequently played . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of over@@ dosage the patient is observ@@ able to observe a tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see Section 4.8 ) , if necessary , necessary support measures are necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Am@@ mel@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the process of viral g@@ ag@@ - and fermentation poly@@ pro@@ filed markings with the result of an education un@@ mature , non @-@ infectious viral particles .
anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ mel@@ avi@@ r in vitro on HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB has been investigated by acute lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F and H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ ors ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ mel@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M of acute cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells
the connection between the activity of Am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ Do@@ si@@ dings were observed - as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ble@@ oo@@ red treatment sch@@ emas with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ep@@ ho@@ res - the described mut@@ ations rarely observed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral patients receiving 100@@ mg of Fos@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ rolog@@ ical procedure occurred within 14 days , with 14 isol@@ ates could be studied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the Isol@@ ate of 13 out of 14 children where a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred within the 59 days with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ ants showed non @-@ treated patients who were similar to those with adults .

in the study AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) in patients with vi@@ rolog@@ ical verses of over 96 weeks in patients with Vietnam@@ ese failure to occur :
based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance setting analyses gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpre@@ ter systems can be applied to the assessment of the activity of Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ or@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ or@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ or@@ avi@@ r and Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ or@@ avi@@ r when patients with Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ mer @-@ resistant isol@@ ates can be applied .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ or@@ avi@@ r defines resistance than the presence of the mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ 2A / C / F / F / V / F / F / V / F / F / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conclusions regarding the relev@@ ance of specific mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation samples can be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended always to determine the current interpre@@ ter systems analysis of the results of resistance tests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance of the phen@@ otype based phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpre@@ ter systems can be applied in combination with the gen@@ otyp@@ ical data for the assessment of the activity of Am@@ la@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ or@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ or@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ or@@ avi@@ r and Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ or@@ avi@@ r when patients with Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ mer @-@ resistant isol@@ ates can be applied .
companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have been developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic Cut @-@ offs ( Interface points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpre@@ t results of a resistance tests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each of these four with a reduced sensitivity of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross @-@ resistant against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ j@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are currently data on the cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r and other Prot@@ ease In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral attacks ( one of them denied a resistance against Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ or@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 Isol@@ ate ) , In@@ j@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vice versa , Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other Prot@@ ease @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; obtaining these activity seems depending on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
early departure of a failed therapy is recommended to keep the acquisition of a wide range of mut@@ ations in the limits that can affect the subsequent treatment of noc@@ tur@@ nal effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , with a random@@ ised study ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ sti@@ fl@@ are ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ sti@@ fl@@ are alog@@ a ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or standard therapy ( standard of care , So@@ c ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dos@@ ed kn@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one hundred thre@@ es@@ core three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to as@@ oil and at least another PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the partial @-@ study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the primary analysis presented the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the adoption of time ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) compared to 16 weeks , with a non @-@ sub @-@ wave of 0,4 log@@ 10 copies / ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ous ads is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the studies , A@@ generate solution for intake and capsules of 15 mg / kg has three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , whereas the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no low dose of do@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of the patients treated with PI had previously given at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the NR@@ TI@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 48 weeks , about 25 % of patients included in the study a plasma @-@ 1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
19 B@@ ased on this data should be considered with the treatment of treatment optimisation using PI in the expected benefits of &quot; un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ated &quot; ag@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
508 % increase then reduced by 30 % for C@@ max . when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake decreased and the rate of res@@ or@@ ption was influenced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 liters ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and it is possible to close a large distribution volume and an un@@ hin@@ dered pen@@ it@@ ration of Am@@ mel@@ avi@@ r from the bloo@@ d@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of active substance in the plasma , with the amount of unused am@@ bo@@ ar that remains the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the absolute concentration of imper@@ ative am@@ hy@@ b@@ abo@@ o remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredients during the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State can vary across the range from C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , medicines that CY@@ P3@@ A4 should be induc@@ ed or inhi@@ bit a medium of CY@@ P3@@ A4 if they are given with caution ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gift of veins capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r exposition like in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
amber cavi@@ r is made from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from capsules ; therefore A@@ generate solution and as@@ generators capsules are not ex@@ changeable to a billi@@ on@@ set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gi@@ bly negle@@ cted , therefore , the effect of a ren@@ al functioning on the elim@@ ination of Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is likely to be low . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these treatments lead to Am@@ mel@@ avi@@ r plasma mirrors comparable to those that are achieved at healthy volunteers according to a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r twice daily without a simultaneous administration of kn@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in long @-@ term studies on c@@ ran@@ ogen@@ icity with Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , in cases of male animals , Aden@@ ep@@ ato@@ bili@@ ary Aden@@ os@@ ae on humans , after two daily gift of 1200 mg Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r , promised . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 21 underlying mechanisms for the formation of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular civilians and car@@ cin@@ omas have not yet been solved , and the relev@@ ance of these observed effects for human beings is un@@ clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , from the current exposure data on humans , both clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application , fluctu@@ ates little evidence of the adoption of a clinical relev@@ ance of these findings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity testing , micro@@ kernel test for rats and chromosome analysis , Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ ations nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and demonstrated in clinical everyday life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials , no significant metast@@ asis was observed in patients , either during the treatment of A@@ ha@@ ase or after the end of the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; studies on the tox@@ icity of young animals , which were treated from 4 days at the age of 4 , showed high mortality in the control of the animals and those with Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a system@@ ic plasma exposure , which was significantly higher ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposition of minor changes including thy@@ mus@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ eton changes , which indicate a delayed development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
24 If A@@ ha@@ ase capsules are applied without the increased addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sted ) higher doses of as@@ then@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for ag@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily total dose of 2400 mg Am@@ os@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the simultaneous application is to be contra@@ indicated in patients with low or light liver failure when patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 26 For some medicines that cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , like carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in , are available methods for determining the substance concentration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ag@@ ase should be set in duration 27 if a rash of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see Section 4.8 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ ocy@@ tic was associated with individual factors such as older age , and with drugs @-@ related factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and related metabolic disorders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % decrease in AU@@ C of Am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical understanding and a resistance of resistance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
508 % increase ; for C@@ max it is reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is given in combination with Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ mel@@ avi@@ r ( 600 m@@ g. twice daily ) with cal@@ or@@ ra ( 600 m@@ g. of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) were reached , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if am@@ hy@@ lo@@ avi@@ r is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a dosing system for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra may not be given , however , a close monitoring is recommended as the effectiveness and im@@ perfection of this combination is not known . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the treatment with ef@@ av@@ ir@@ enz in combination with Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended because the exposure of both Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ mer would suff@@ ice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when these drugs are used together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical supervision should be undertaken as an accurate pre@@ diction of the effect of Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &apos;s combination is difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin will be taken along with ag@@ ase in at least half of the recommended dose 31 , though there are no clinical data available for this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel @-@ block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , di@@ odi@@ pine , di@@ odi@@ pine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days were decreased , while end@@ ogen@@ ous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % turn@@ table interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with an associated gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with ag@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ) is strongly recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg No@@ re@@ th@@ ind@@ rone ) resulted in a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min from Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied after careful consideration of the possible use of the potential for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a reproduction study on pregnant rats that was administered by the arm@@ or in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period Am@@ mel@@ avi@@ r was still a decreased increase in body weight during the lac@@ tation period .
the harm@@ less@@ ness of ag@@ ase has been studied in adults and in children under 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of over@@ dosage the patient is observ@@ able to observe a tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see Section 4.8 ) , if necessary , necessary support measures are necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ mel@@ avi@@ r in vitro on HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB has been investigated by acute lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F and H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ ors ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ mel@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M with acute infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vice versa , Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other Prot@@ ease @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; obtaining these activity seems depending on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on this data , treatment optimization was taken into account with PI pre @-@ treated children of the expected benefits of &quot; un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ated &quot; ag@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the absolute concentration of imper@@ ative am@@ hy@@ b@@ abo@@ o remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredients during the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State can vary across the range from C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , medicines that CY@@ P3@@ A4 should be induc@@ ed or inhi@@ bit a medium of CY@@ P3@@ A4 if they are given with caution ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gi@@ bly negle@@ cted . therefore , the effect of a ren@@ al functioning on the elim@@ ination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is likely to be low . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in long @-@ term studies on the lum@@ ber@@ ogen@@ icity with Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , Aden@@ os@@ at@@ ocy@@ tes Aden@@ os@@ por@@ ous Aden@@ os@@ por@@ ous Aden@@ os@@ ae on men after two hours of daily gift of 1200 mg of Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ at@@ ocy@@ tes Aden@@ os@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ omas have not yet been solved and the relev@@ ance of these observed effects for human beings is un@@ clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , from the current exposure data on humans , from clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application , however little indications for the adoption of a clinical relev@@ ance of these findings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity testing , micro@@ kernel test for rats and chromosome analysis , Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ ations nor dar@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; studies on the tox@@ icity of young animals , which were treated from 4 days at the age of 4 , showed high mortality in the control of the animals and those with Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these results let us make , that in young they are not fully mature , Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r , or other critical components of the formulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ ently ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children aged 4 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the benefits of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , &quot; as@@ modi@@ c &quot; solution to capture , has not been treated with PI previously treated patients in PI . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take up is 14 % less than capsule ; therefore A@@ generating capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable to one milli@@ grams per milli@@ grams ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be able to swallow capsules , if they are able to swallow capsules , use the solution to redeem ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recommended dose for ag@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs that should not be exceeded every day ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , no dose recommendation for the simultaneous application of as@@ oil solution to capture and low do@@ si@@ fied k@@ avi@@ r can be avoided this combination with these patient groups can be avoided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although a dose adjustment for Am@@ la@@ avi@@ r is not considered to be necessary , an application of ast@@ o@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of high pro@@ o@@ ethylene gly@@ co@@ bal@@ ances in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure .
the simultaneous administration can lead to a Com@@ peti@@ tive inhibit@@ ing of this medicine and may cause severe and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects such as heart rhyth@@ mia ( z ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be advised that atri@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy cannot lead to an infection of HIV infection , and that they also continue to develop opport@@ un@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with ag@@ ase avo@@ ids risk 47 of infection of HIV on others by sexual contact , or contamination with blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for some medicines that cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , like carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants , and war@@ far@@ in , are available methods for determining the substance concentration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ag@@ ase should be dropped in duration if a rash occurs on system@@ ic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see Section 4.8 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ ocy@@ tic was associated with individual factors such as older age , and with drugs @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % decrease in AU@@ C of Am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical understanding and a resistance of resistance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
508 % increase ; for C@@ max it is reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is given in combination with Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; increasing intake with ast@@ ero@@ id can considerably increase their plasma concentrations in combination with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , dis@@ rup@@ tions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on data 54 different CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am significantly increased significantly higher plasma concentrations from Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the potential risk of human beings is not known as the result of possible toxic reactions from the fet@@ us to the contained propylene gly@@ col mixture ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the milk of lac@@ tic rats , Am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were not known , however , it is not known whether Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r over@@ rides his breast milk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a reproduction study on pregnant rats who was administered to the U@@ ter@@ us by the end of the lac@@ tation period till the end of the lac@@ tation period showed a decreased increase in 55 body weight .
the harm@@ less@@ ness of ag@@ ase has been studied in adults and in children under 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are used in connection with the intake of as@@ generators or another at the same time to the HIV treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ Do@@ si@@ dings were observed - as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ble@@ oo@@ red treatment sch@@ emas with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ep@@ ho@@ res - the described mut@@ ations rarely observed .

perhaps you would like to read this later again . − If you have any further questions please contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . − This medicine was personally prescribed to you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can harm other people if they have the same complaints as you . − If any of these effects are noted , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your doctor will normally advise you to apply A@@ ha@@ ase capsules along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , to increase the effect of ag@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use of as@@ generators will be based on that of your doctor for you the individual viral resistance test and your treatment story .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform your doctor if you suffer from one of the above mentioned diseases , or take any of the drugs mentioned above . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if your doctor has recommended that you take A@@ ha@@ ase capsules along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to rein@@ force the effect ( boo@@ sters ) before starting treatment the instruction information on Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r carefully read .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; likewise , no adequate information can be found in order to recommend the application of A@@ ha@@ ase capsules , together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at age 4 to 12 years or generally in patients under 50 kg of body weight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it is important that you start the section &quot; With taking advantage of as@@ generators with other medicines before taking off with the intake of ads . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you may need additional factor VIII to control blood pressure . − With patients receiving a anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , a re@@ distribution , accumulation or loss of body fat can occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are certain medicines that lead to severe side effects , like carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tac@@ am@@ y@@ cin , cycl@@ am@@ y@@ cin , cycl@@ am@@ y@@ cin , cycl@@ am@@ y@@ cin , cycl@@ am@@ y@@ cin , cycl@@ am@@ y@@ cin , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants , tried to minimize additional blood tests in order to minimize potential problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is recommended that HIV positive women are to keep their children under any circumstances , to avoid HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no studies have been performed to the impact of A@@ la@@ ase , or the ability to serve machines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are using Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , it is advisable to take this more than one hour before or after a@@ ha@@ ase , otherwise the effects of ads can be reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dose of ag@@ ase capsules is 600 mg twice daily with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your doctor decides that taking rite of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not suitable for you , you will need to take higher doses ( 1200 mg of Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 85 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 85 &quot; It is very important to take advantage of the entire daily dose , which your doctor is prescribed to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can include fat loss of legs , arms , and face , fet@@ ching on the abdom@@ en and in other inner organs , breast aug@@ mentation and fatty breast pur@@ ses in the neck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the other ingredients are propylene gly@@ col , azi@@ go@@ l 400 ( pol@@ y ethylene gly@@ col , sac@@ char@@ in sodium , sodium chloride , cit@@ ric acid , cit@@ ric acid , cit@@ ric cit@@ rate , puri@@ fied water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • For six weeks of treatment in the genital area , Al@@ dar@@ a can carry up to a maximum of 16 weeks per week . • In case of case single bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas it is up to a maximum of 16 weeks , with four weeks break between the treatment cycles , three times a week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before bed@@ time , the cream is spread on the affected skin areas because it remains sufficient for long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( the same cream but without the active substance ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies at 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks .
the main indic@@ ative index for efficacy was the number of patients with complete demo@@ lition of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was examined at 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks or plac@@ ebo either every day or five times a week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main indic@@ ative index for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two trials in total 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ine guys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the plac@@ ebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area the total healing rate was taken from 66 % to 80 % in the patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group .
the most common adverse events of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the use of cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .

the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream is so long for@@ tz@@ ut until all visible inclin@@ ation in the genital or per@@ ci@@ dal zone has disappeared or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment time .
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment process should be considered if intensive local infections occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or when in the treatment sector is observed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the l@@ esi@@ ons were completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a dose was left out , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she noticed this and then proceed with the usual therapy plan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème is applied in a thin layer and rub in a thin , dried skin zone , until the cream is completely moved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it should be eff@@ ected in these patients , between the benefits of an treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and associated with a possible intensi@@ fication of its auto@@ immune disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it should be eff@@ ected in these patients , between the benefits of an treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ reduction or gra@@ ft versus host@@ - reaction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in other trials in which no daily in@@ timacy was performed , two cases of severe ph@@ im@@ ose and a case were observed with a circum@@ cis@@ ing leading strike . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in higher than the recommended cans there is an increased risk of severe local irritation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases where severe local irritation were observed and / or caused a temporary physical injury .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in cases where such reactions appeared at the outcome of the ureth@@ ra , some women had trouble passing urine and treatment of the affected area were required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream directly in connection to treatment with other cut@@ aneous applications , they have no clinical experiences so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited data suggest an enhanced rate of til@@ ting reductions in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème has shown a lower effectiveness in this patient group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the treatment of bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm to the eyel@@ ids , the nose , the lips or hair@@ line was not studied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions take back in general during therapy or reactions take back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s complaints or due to the sever@@ ity of the local skin reaction , a treatment room can be made of several days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the clinical result of therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin for 12 weeks after the treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since there are currently no data available for long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , some suitable therapy forms should be taken into consideration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and previously treated BC@@ Cs there are no clinical experiences , therefore the application is not recommended in previously treated Tum@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
data from an open clinical study point out that with large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) a lower probability of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of acute attacks on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or ears or in the lip area within the lip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ine ker@@ at@@ osis , anatom@@ ical areas outside the face and scal@@ p . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ical not@@ at@@ osis in arms and hands will not support the effectiveness in this use purpose , therefore such application is not recommended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local skin reaction often occur , but these reactions normally take back to intensity during the therapy or go back after putting the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the local skin reactions to patients would cause great dis@@ comfort or are very strong , treatment can be exposed for several days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 ac@@ ons l@@ esi@@ ons has a lower degree of healing than patients with less than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the immune stimul@@ ating properties I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od can be applied with caution in patients who receive immun@@ o@@ den@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no direct or indirect effects on the pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / f@@ fet@@ al development , de@@ binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although neither in@@ ely after repeated optical use ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) , no recommendation can be given to the application during lac@@ tation period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the patients with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in connection with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in connection with three @-@ week treatment were local reactions in the treatment of the treatment of the event ( 3@@ 3.7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od patients ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most often reported , and possibly using the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème in relation to side @-@ effects include complaints to application area with a frequency of 28,@@ 1 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the study of 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical study of Phase III reported side effects are shown below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most frequent occurrence as probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in connection between these studies were a reaction to the application area ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od patients ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the adverse events , which were treated by 252 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od to patients with ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ osis , are listed below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a study determined review of clinical signs that there is often observed in these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials including Er@@ y@@ them ( 61 % ) and ero@@ sion / bott@@ ling ( 23 % ) and o@@ dem ( 14 % ) and o@@ dem ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this no@@ isy evaluation of clinical signs indicate that there were five times a weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ( 31 % ) , severe sei@@ z@@ ure of sei@@ z@@ ure ( 13 % ) , and heavy sei@@ z@@ ure and mar@@ ching ( 19 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials to study the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ c@@ ine ker@@ at@@ osis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was found at the treatment location or in the surrounding area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the acci@@ dentally unique oral up@@ take of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could result nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , head@@ ache , my@@ al@@ gi@@ es and fever . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clin@@ ically most severe side effect , norm@@ alized after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous hy@@ dra@@ tion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study an increasing system@@ ic concentration of alpha inter@@ fer@@ on and other cy@@ to@@ kin@@ es were detected after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 sound @-@ relevant phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the effectiveness in regards to a complete al@@ im@@ od treatment is superior to an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of a plac@@ ebo treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at 60 % of patients with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients the fail@@ ures were completely healed , with 20 % of the 105 patients with plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients ( 95 % ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a complete execution could be achieved at 23 % from 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients over 5 % of 161 with plac@@ ebo @-@ treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s effectiveness in five times per week over 6 weeks has been investigated in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed by single primary super@@ fi@@ zi@@ tional bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the study from an open and un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years of this data show that roughly 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % &#93; ( 7@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this also remained for 48 months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s effectiveness in one or two treatment sessions of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free time period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ ak@@ at@@ ot@@ ical , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ ic l@@ esi@@ ons within a related 25 c@@ m2 area than on the hair@@ less scal@@ p or in the face . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the one @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment rooms a real rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the licensed indications , ac@@ tin@@ c@@ osis and super fibr@@ illary bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma usually occur in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients , and were therefore not examined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
al@@ im@@ a cream has been examined in four random@@ ised and double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies in children from 2 to 15 years with m@@ oll@@ us@@ cum cont@@ ag@@ i@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these studies , the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not shown in these studies ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a minimal system@@ ic absorption of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème through the skin of 58 patients with ak@@ ine ker@@ at@@ osis was observed in the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentrations in the ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and bet@@ ru@@ gen 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml in the application in the face ( 25@@ mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the calculated half @-@ life time was about 10@@ times higher than the 2 ho@@ ur@@ ly half @-@ time after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in a former study , which indicates an extended re@@ tention of medication in the skin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the data on the system@@ ic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od according to top@@ ical application was low in patients at the age of 6 @-@ 12 years and comparable to patients suffering from healthy adults and adults with ak@@ tin@@ ical not@@ at@@ osis or super@@ fi@@ zi@@ ont@@ al bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a four month study on which weigh@@ ed tox@@ icity at the rat ratios of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg , kg regul@@ ates significantly reduced body weight and higher milk weight ; an appropriate study for four months showed no similar effects in the mouse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a two @-@ year study on car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice near three days per week , no tum@@ ours in@@ induc@@ ed towards the application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low system@@ ic absorption from the human skin and does not mut@@ agen , is a risk to see people based on the system@@ ic exposure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tum@@ ors appeared in the mice , which was treated with the impact @-@ free cream , used earlier and in greater numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can harm other people , even if these same symptoms seem to affect you . − If any of these effects are noted , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
● F@@ eig@@ ni@@ zen ( Con@@ d@@ yl@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) formed in the skin in the range of gen@@ itals ( genital organs ) and the anus ( after ) is a frequently encountered , slow growing shape of the skin cancer with very low probability of the spread to other parts of the body .
when it is treated un@@ treated it may result in particular in the face - therefore a early detection and treatment is important .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ac@@ tin@@ ical cher@@ ries are harsh areas of the skin that occur with people , which were exposed to sunlight during their previous life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ dar@@ a should only be applied with flat @-@ tin@@ c@@ osis in the face and on the scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is the best suitable treatment .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O if you used to apply al@@ im@@ a cream or other , similar preparations before you start with the treatment . o Do not use al@@ dar@@ a cream until you get problems with your previous medication or surgical treatment . o A@@ void the contact with eyes , lips and r@@ end@@ omet@@ ri@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in acci@@ dental contact the cream rinse through rinse with water . o Do not use cream as your doctor . o if reactions to the treated position arise , wash the cream with a mild soap and water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the reactions are delayed , you can continue the treatment . o In@@ forming your doctor if they have no normal blood picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this daily cleaning is not performed under the fo@@ res@@ kin , the skin or difficulty may be eff@@ ected by the skin or difficulty passing the fo@@ res@@ kin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do not apply al@@ im@@ a cream into ureth@@ ra ( ureth@@ ra ) to the vagina ( vagina ) , cer@@ vi@@ x ( cer@@ vi@@ x ) or within the anus ( after ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking other medicines having serious problems with your immune system , you should not use this medication for no more than one treatment cycle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have sexual intercourse during the infection in the genital area , treatment with Al@@ ben@@ a cream is done after sexual intercourse ( not before ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you apply other medicines or are recently applied , even if it is not prescri@@ ption medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wear a thin layer of Al@@ dar@@ a cream on the clean , dry skin place with the p@@ inc@@ ts and rub the cream gently on the skin until the cream is completely moved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
men with p@@ eig@@ ni@@ tions under the fo@@ res@@ kin must remove the fo@@ res@@ kin each day and wash the skin area among them ( see section 2 ) What do you have to consider before applying Al@@ ben@@ a cream ? &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have the impression that the effect of Al@@ dar@@ a is too strong or weak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for 6 weeks , 5 days per week apply a sufficient amount of Al@@ dar@@ a cream to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very common adverse events ( expected more than 1 out of 10 patients ) occasionally expect side effects ( in less than 1 out of 100 patients ) Very rare side effects ( less than 1 out of 10,000 patients ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell your doctor / your doctor or your pharmac@@ ist / your pharmac@@ ist immediately , if you feel un@@ comfortable during the use of Al@@ dar@@ a cream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case your skin reacts strongly to the treatment with al@@ im@@ a cream , you should not continue using the affected skin area with water and mild soap and communicate your doctor or your pharmac@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a inher@@ ited number of blood cells may cause you to sus@@ cep@@ tible to infections , and it can cause you a blue stain , or she can cause fatigue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects you significantly imp@@ aired or you have noticed effects that are not indicated in this user information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , you can feel it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the fields that you have applied Al@@ dar@@ a cream ( 8 % of patients ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mostly , it is a lighter skin reaction which sound within about 2 weeks after de@@ comp@@ ose the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; occasionally , some patients notice changes in application place ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , in@@ dig@@ nation , der@@ mati@@ tis , nau@@ sea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and fatigue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; occasionally , some patients suffer from changes in the application area ( bloody , inflammation , wound diseases , cer@@ vical or dis@@ comfort , depression , facial pain , ul@@ c@@ pain , fever , weakness , fever , or ch@@ ills ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma is used in patients with reliable diagnosis of a mu@@ d@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ tin I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( symptoms which are not linked to the brain or brain disorders ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that certain substances ( gly@@ c@@ amin@@ ites , g@@ ags ) are not to be disman@@ tled and can therefore accumul@@ ate in most organs in the body and damage them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following non @-@ neurolog@@ ical symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , sti@@ ff joints , comp@@ licate movements , decreased canc@@ ers , heart and eye disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma should be supervised by a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or hospital with res@@ is@@ sing devices , and patients need appropriate drugs to prevent an allergic reaction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study , mainly the safety of the drug was investigated ( by reducing its effect on the reduction of the concentration of concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in children under five years alone , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed up the concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal high liver at the end of the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common adverse events in patients at age over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nau@@ sea , abdominal pain , skin rash , pain in limbs , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion center . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very frequent side effects in patients under five years of age are increased blood pressure and reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measuring size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ mic ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be very sensitive to patients who react possibly strongly ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will test all new information that may be known , check , and update this summary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients who are al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me to observe the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of anti@@ bodies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission issued the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. , approved for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using Ch@@ o @-@ mam@@ mal @-@ cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , derived from the Chinese Ham@@ sters ) .
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma is indicated for long @-@ time enzymes in patients with reliable diagnosis of a mu@@ d@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ tin I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma should be done by a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the patient can be increased from 2 E / kg / h , every 15 minutes in individual steps a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h can be increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years was not determined and for these patients no sampling scheme can be recommended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety and efficacy of al@@ ar@@ az@@ y@@ ma in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and no sampling scheme can be recommended for those patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients may develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which are defined as each related side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion of life ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , specially these patients should continue to be monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be provided only in an appropriate clinical manner where medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that almost all patients of Ig@@ G anti@@ bodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase are normally formed within 3 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to develop patients , anti@@ bodies , or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , must be treated with caution ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as little experience concerning the recovery of treatment after a longer break , has to be careful with the theore@@ tically increased risk reaction after an inter@@ ruption of treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
60 minutes before the beginning of in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tika ) to treat the potential occur@@ ance of in@@ fusion reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of light or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction has occurred . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion has to be stopped until symptoms are reduced to investigate a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ fusion can be re @-@ recorded with an incre@@ ment rate of 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate , in which the reaction has occurred . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate occurred in which the reaction has occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Pro@@ ca@@ in because a potential risk of inter@@ fer@@ ence with the intra@@ cellular absorption of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase exists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experimental studies can not be concluded on direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see paragraph 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exp@@ on@@ ates from lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over the breast milk , is suggested , during the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
adverse reactions in clinical trials were mainly filed as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that were observed in the phase 3 study ( duration of treatment up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) were observed .
adverse reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me who were observed during the phase @-@ 3 study and their extension for a total of 45 years in the age of 5 years or older in a duration of up to 4 years ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some patients with heavy M@@ PS I @-@ conditional participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , bron@@ chi@@ os@@ pas@@ mus , breathing and facial expressions ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children Dis@@ pos@@ al drug risks associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , associated with a total of 20 patients under the age of 5 , including a period of heavy duty and duration of up to 12 months , have been reported in the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in most patients it came to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ di@@ version within 3 months following the treatment of an ser@@ o@@ con@@ tention period ( an average age of 5 years compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to premature explo@@ iting from the study ) ass@@ orted bodies were observed in 13 / 45 patients , including 3 patients , including 3 patients , where there was never too Ser@@ o@@ con@@ tra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with lack of low @-@ low @-@ antibody levels had a robust reduction of the g@@ ag @-@ mirror in the har@@ p while patients with high antibody tit@@ res was an variable reduction of G@@ ag in the Har@@ n .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four patients ( three in the phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ g@@ inal to low neutr@@ alizing clinical effect on enzy@@ matic lar@@ on@@ id@@ al activity in vitro , which seemed not to affect clinical effectiveness and / or reduction of g@@ ag in the har@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the presence of anti@@ bodies seemed not to stand in connection with the incidence of undes@@ ired medicines , which coinci@@ de with the formation of Ig@@ G @-@ anti@@ bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reas@@ oning method is sufficient for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ str@@ ates , and the displac@@ ement of an accumulation of sufficient accumulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly absorbed from the circulation and cells into the lys@@ os@@ omes , most likely over man@@ osis @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study from 6 to 43 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the majority of patients from the central phen@@ otype was the phen@@ otype in the central phen@@ otype and only one patient contained the heavy phen@@ otype . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients have been recru@@ ited , if they had a driving exp@@ on@@ ical value ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 feet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute passage in the 6 minute walk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all patients were recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me every week ( 182 weeks ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma joined the plac@@ eb@@ ral group to improve lung function and the ability to be displayed in the following table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an open extension study the improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks showed in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and of 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as seen from the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is not significant above that period clin@@ ically significant and the absolute lung volumes increased further propor@@ tionally to the height of growing children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the 26 patients with a h@@ ep@@ at@@ oma in front of the treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) had a normal liver size until the end of the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the first 4 weeks , a significant decrease in the fermentation mirror in the har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg of cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) was observed until the end of the study remained constant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in regard to the hetero@@ geneous statistical presentation of patients , the clin@@ ically significant changes of cross @-@ point AH@@ I and visual acuity ( 58 % ) was generally consistent with 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one @-@ year @-@ old Phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma was examined in 20 patients ( 16 patients with severe displac@@ ement form and 4 with the middle cutter shape ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four patients , the dosage was increased because of increased G@@ AG@@ - mirror in the Har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in several patients an increase of weight growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) showed a normal mental development velocity ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with moderate reduction form only limited or even no progress in cognitive development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a Phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various alkal@@ oids are performed on the g@@ ag @-@ mirror in the har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walking test . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dosing scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can be present in patients who have difficulty with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , however , is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two sampling sch@@ emas is equivalent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will provide any new information available , rate annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the medication will be updated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of patients at the age of 5 was similar to that of older and less affected patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on conventional concepts for safety pharmac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in exceptional gift , tox@@ icity in repeated declar@@ atory and reproduction of reproduction , the pre@@ clinical data won no particular haz@@ ards for human beings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , there is an enzyme called F@@ α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which has certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ ite ) , either in small quantity before or this enzyme is completely different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are allergic to one of the ingredients of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , or if an allergic reaction to lar@@ v@@ id@@ ase occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an in@@ fusion @-@ conditional reaction is a side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion of life ( see section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma with other medicines , please inform your doctor if you use medicines , chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or pro@@ ca@@ ine , because a possible risk of dimin@@ ished effect of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

indications of use - di@@ lution and application The concentrate for the production of in@@ fusion solution must be diluted in front of the application and is intended for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors or medical professionals ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initial inclusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased , if the patient is toler@@ ated , every 15 minutes gradually increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some patients with heavy M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - un@@ conditional participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , but bron@@ chi@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breath and facial surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very frequently ( occurrence by more than 1 of 10 patients ) : • head@@ ache • nau@@ sea pain , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • Low oxygen • hypertension • less oxygen in the blood • Response to the in@@ fusion center &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will provide any new information that will be available , rate annually , and if necessary , the package directions will be updated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the ready made preparation is not used immediately , it is no longer stored for 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C , if the di@@ lution under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technology ) • J@@ e according to body weight of individual patients first determine the number of th@@ inner bottles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is applied together with Cis@@ pl@@ atin which does not have any chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) which has not yet been removed ( or any other parts of the body ) , or is spread to other parts of the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • advanced or metastatic &quot; lung cancer , which does not attack the epithel@@ ial cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is treated with patients who were previously un@@ treated previously , in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who had previously been given other chemotherapy regim@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to reduce side effects , patients during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( vitamin ) and obtain inj@@ ections of vitamin B12 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when A@@ lim@@ ta is given together with Cis@@ pl@@ atin , which should be given prior to or after the gift of Cis@@ pl@@ atin which should be prevented before or after the gift of cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients whose blood pattern changes or with which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be worn down or the dose should be reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ed slow@@ s down the formation of DNA and RNA , and prevents the cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in its active form is lighter than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of active form of medication and a longer active duration in cancer cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously received chemotherapy against their illness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the treatment of non @-@ cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , previously compared to chemotherapy with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( a different drug against cancer ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ lim@@ ta also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( a further drug against cancer ) , both in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously obtained chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ pl@@ atin , survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.6 months at the sole meeting of Cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time was with A@@ lim@@ ta 8,3 months , compared with 7.9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both trials , patients with cancer did not attack the c@@ SC@@ C attack , during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta prolonged survival compared to the compar@@ ative potential . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued the company Eli L@@ illy Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. for placing the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each water bottle must be absorbed by 4.2 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chloride inj@@ ections ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the corresponding volume of the necessary Do@@ - S@@ IS is taken from the water bottle and diluted with a sodium chloride inj@@ ector solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is displayed in combination with Cis@@ pl@@ atin shown for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma except for over@@ active plate of epi@@ th@@ eli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered as an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of Cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approx . 30 minutes after conclusion of the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ single bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma after previous chemotherapy the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reaction , a day before and after the treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid had to be given a day after the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the seven days before the first dose P@@ em@@ etry must be taken at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid , and the intake must be continued during the entire duration of therapy and for further 21 days after the last ph@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients must also receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in week before the first P@@ em@@ etry supplement and after every third eclip@@ se cycle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients receiving pac@@ em@@ etry , in front of every gift a complete blood picture should be created , including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ tes and a Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ame trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ in trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be &lt; 3 times the upper limit value .
in the beginning of a new treatment course a dose of dos@@ cope must take place under the end of the blood bil@@ rs of blood flow or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological tox@@ icity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after recovery the patients must be treated in accordance with the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA than mon@@ otherapy or in combination with Cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these criteria conform to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC level 2 bleeding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should patients not develop non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological tox@@ icity 1 to 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be interrupted by the patient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if in patients after 2 doses of dose or non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological tox@@ icity or non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological tox@@ icity 3 or 4 or 4 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clinical trials have no notice that in patients aged 65 years or in comparison to those aged 65 years , clinical trials under@@ took an increased ad@@ jun@@ i@@ - ko . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for the application in children under 18 years due to sufficient data on harm@@ less@@ ness and effectiveness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials , patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min were not necessary to out@@ pace the dose adjustment recommended for all patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the data situation in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however patients with a liver function limit of &gt; to 1.5 times in the upper limit value ( for the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.3 @-@ times of the upper limit ( for the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) is not specifically investigated in studies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients must not be administered to patients with respect to the bone mar@@ ital regulation , before their absolute neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ s may not be administered at a value of ≥ 400 cells / mm ³ and the Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - number once again reached a value of ≥ 100.000 cells / mm ³ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a dose @-@ reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of absolute neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ ari@@ ous number and maximum non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological tox@@ icity as they were observed in the preceding treatment cycles ( see paragraph 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 ha@@ emat@@ ological tox@@ icity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degree 3 / 4 Neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie and infection with grade 3 / 4 Neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was examined for a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , all patients with p@@ em@@ etry must be dependent on acid and vitamin B12 to prevent harmful tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with mild to medium kidney failure ( C@@ SA@@ IDs ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - c@@ yl@@ ic acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) must be paid for at least 2 days before therapy and after therapy with p@@ em@@ etry ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all patients , for treatment with P@@ em@@ etry must be expected , intake of N@@ SA@@ IDs must be paid for at least 5 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with par@@ em@@ etry ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many patients , where these events occur , had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including dehy@@ dra@@ tion , existing high blood pressure or diabetes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant hy@@ dra@@ tion accumulation in trans@@ cellular space a drainage of the result should be considered before the mixed treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 5 most severe cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical trials of P@@ em@@ etry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , the use of atten@@ u@@ ated fuel prices ( except yellow fever ; this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the possibility of an ir@@ reversible injury is made for re@@ productive capacity due to P@@ em@@ etry , men should be advised in prior to treatment , advice regarding se@@ ma@@ stur@@ dity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in patients with normal kidney function ( C@@ SA@@ IDs ) such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) to a dimin@@ ished breakdown of side effects .
therefore caution is advisable if in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dose for at least 2 days before the therapy , a day of therapy and reduction of 2 days after therapy with par@@ em@@ etry should be avoided ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since no data are received with regard to interaction with N@@ SA@@ IDs , such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application must be mixed with p@@ em@@ etry at least 2 days after therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of t@@ inn@@ ess status during the disease and the possibility of inter@@ actions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy is an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ) . when the decision was taken to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in pregnant women , but as in an@@ de@@ - an@@ timet@@ abol@@ ites are expected to be severe during pregnancy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; par@@ rot should not be applied during pregnancy , except if un@@ necessarily and after careful consideration of the use for the mother and risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the possibility of an ir@@ reversible injury to re@@ productive capacity is made possible , men should be advised before the treatment begins to ob@@ struct advice regarding the locking system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not known whether p@@ em@@ etry exceeds the breast milk , and unwanted effects with the inf@@ ant inf@@ ant cannot be excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects that were reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with Mes@@ end@@ othel@@ i@@ om , which were random@@ ized Cis@@ pl@@ atin which were random@@ ized cis@@ pl@@ atin as a mon@@ otherapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this table , a threshold of 5 % was laid down regarding the absorption of all events , where the reporting doctor held a connection with P@@ em@@ etry and Cis@@ pl@@ atin which was possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC tox@@ icity , which were reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients , were random@@ ized cis@@ pl@@ atin and po@@ em@@ etry , enc@@ ep@@ it@@ ated ar@@ rhyth@@ mia and motor re@@ ap@@ athy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects that were reported in &gt; 5 % of 265 patients , random@@ ized p@@ em@@ etry . and 276 patients were random@@ ized doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el as a mon@@ otherapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this table , a threshold of 5 % was determined concerning the acceptance of all events , where the reporting doctor held a connection with P@@ em@@ etry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC tox@@ icity , which were reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients , were random@@ ized P@@ em@@ etry to participate , included su@@ prag@@ v@@ entri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the clin@@ ically relevant laboratory tox@@ icity 3 and 4 was similar to the combined results of three single P@@ em@@ etry mixed mon@@ other@@ api@@ aries ( n = 164 ) of the phase 2 ( compared with 5.3 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase of Alan@@ in@@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to lead to differences in patient population since the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and / or abnormal breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal case values of liver function .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects associated with N@@ SC@@ LC , random@@ ized Cis@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ etry received and 8@@ 30 patients with N@@ SC@@ LC , random@@ ized Cis@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clin@@ ically relevant tox@@ icity , which were reported at ≥ 1 % and ≤ 5 % ( often ) of patients , were random@@ ized cis@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clin@@ ically relevant tox@@ icity , which were reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of the patients , associated to cis@@ pl@@ atin and pon@@ em@@ etry , included : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clinical trials were reported in patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ed treatment occasionally cases of Co@@ li@@ - tis , including intestinal and re@@ ct@@ als , intestinal per@@ formers , intestinal ne@@ cro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ li@@ tis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clinical trials were occasionally reported in patients with p@@ em@@ etry , occasionally deadly inter@@ sti@@ cal p@@ ne@@ um@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory failure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of cases of acute kidney failure , mon@@ otherapy or combination with other chemotherapy was reported ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were reported cases of radi@@ en@@ pne@@ um@@ oni@@ tis in patients who were used before , during or after their p@@ im@@ par@@ ted therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AL@@ IM@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ etry xed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ di@@ op@@ la@@ sty Anti@@ fol@@ ate that breaks its effect by consuming a weight @-@ dependent metabolic processes that are necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that P@@ em@@ etry has been blocked as an anti@@ fol@@ ate with multiple att@@ aching ( DH@@ FR ) and Gly@@ c@@ am@@ i@@ dri@@ ves@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ id@@ ase ( DH@@ FR ) and gly@@ co@@ am@@ i@@ dri@@ ves@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ id@@ ase ( DH@@ FR ) and the thy@@ mid@@ ine bacteria from thy@@ mid@@ ine and Pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ MP@@ HAC@@ IS , a multi @-@ cent@@ ric , random@@ ised , straightforward @-@ blind phase 3 study from AL@@ IM@@ TA plus cis@@ pl@@ atin treated patients suffering from AL@@ IM@@ TA and cis@@ pl@@ atin which were collected only with Cis@@ pl@@ atin which had only been installed with Cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients , random@@ ized and treated in the treatment arm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clinical symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ b@@ end@@ othel@@ i@@ om was shown in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / Cis@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole Cis@@ pl@@ atin T@@ in arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms showed an improvement of lung function parameters in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / Cis@@ pl@@ atin arm and a po@@ orer of lung function during the time of control .
a multi @-@ cent@@ ric , random@@ ised and open Phase III study with AL@@ IM@@ TA to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer ( In@@ tent to Tre@@ at Population n = 28@@ 3 ) and 7.9 months treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el treated patients ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) .

limited data from a separately random@@ ised controlled Phase 3 study shows that efficacy data ( survival and progres@@ sion @-@ free survival ) for par@@ em@@ etry between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) previous treatment by doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el similar .
the efficacy analysis of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ under@@ peri@@ ority of the AL@@ IM@@ TA cis@@ pl@@ atin combination opposite the gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine Cis@@ pl@@ atin combination .

it is used in overweight adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BMI ) from ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with a low @-@ cal@@ orie @-@ rich diet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients receiving weight loss after 12 weeks , should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if these enzymes are inhi@@ bited , they can &apos;t disman@@ tle some fats in the diet , causing a quarter of the fats led to the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a third study , all@@ i was compared with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with a plac@@ ebo between 25 and 28 kg / m2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the two studies on patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking plac@@ ebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study with all@@ i in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss could be observed for patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common adverse events of all@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are soci@@ able stain@@ s at after , Fl@@ atus ( winch ) with a bo@@ wel movement , fet@@ al / o@@ ily chair , we@@ ar@@ ching and sof@@ ten@@ ed sections ( winch ) and soft chairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

it may not be applied to patients who suffer from a long @-@ term mal@@ ign@@ ant syndrome ( where not enough nutrients from digestive tract ) or to ch@@ ase of liver ( liver disease ) or during pregnancy or with l@@ act@@ ating mothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in July 2007 , the European Commission issued G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited for placing the transport of Or@@ li@@ stat GS@@ K throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all@@ i is inde@@ xed to weight reduction of adults with obes@@ ity ( Body Mass Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in combination with an easily hypo@@ kal@@ or@@ ical and gre@@ asy treatment .
all@@ i must not be applied by children and adolescents under 18 because there are no sufficient data for efficacy and safety .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Or@@ li@@ stat is not only minim@@ ally absorbed , with elderly and / or kidney function , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or one of the other ingredients • Equ@@ al treatment with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.6 ) • Time treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.8 )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the probability of occurrence of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.8 ) can increase , if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ free meal or obes@@ ity diet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the weight reduction in diabetes can occur with improved metabolic control , patients who can consult a medicine or pharmac@@ ist in the beginning of a therapy with all@@ i a doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients suffering from all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or increased cholesterol , should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage needs to be adjusted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is recommended to take additional fluctu@@ ation vulner@@ able measures to prevent the oral contra@@ cep@@ tive failure ( see Section 4.5 ) , in case of severe diarr@@ ho@@ ea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study on inter@@ actions of pharmaceuticals , as well as in several cases , using or@@ li@@ stat and Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in has been observed a reduction of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma devices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in combination with oral or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ li@@ stat , the quick values ( globally standar@@ dis@@ ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ li@@ stat , concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and the beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ enters into the norm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , patients should be recommended to take a supplement of mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin before bed@@ time to ensure adequate vitamin intake ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the gift of an injection dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , a limited number of healthy volunteers received at the same time Or@@ li@@ stat , a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on plasma concentration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see paragraph 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effects of or@@ li@@ stat mainly are gast@@ ro@@ intestinal nature and are associated with the pharmac@@ ological effects of the medication , since the absorption of incorporated fat is prevented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
gast@@ ro@@ intestinal effects were obtained from clinical trials with Or@@ li@@ stat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Frequ@@ encies are defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / $ ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) and very rare ( incidence based on the data available ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incidence of previously known side effects that were established after the market launch of Or@@ li@@ stat , is not known because these events were recorded voluntarily from a population un@@ certain@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; + It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to def@@ aults in terms of potential or actual gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
single doses of 800 mg or@@ li@@ stat and multiple outlets of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered at normal and overweight subjects over a period of 15 days without taking significant clinical findings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the majority of reported cases reported by Or@@ li@@ stat , either no side effects or similar effects as reported at the recommended dose of or@@ li@@ stat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on studies on humans and animals , from a rapid response of any system@@ ic effects that are attributed to the not@@ orious properties of or@@ li@@ stat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the therapeutic effect focuses in the l@@ umen of stomach and the upper d@@ une bonds by co@@ valent bonds to the active Ser@@ in @-@ rest of the g@@ astr@@ a and pan@@ cre@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from clinical trials , 60 mg of or@@ li@@ stat , administered three times a day , the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fet@@ al is blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 measured the effectiveness of 60 mg or@@ li@@ stat that was taken three times daily in combination with hypo@@ kal@@ ine and gre@@ asy food .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the starting point ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ ization ) was assessed as follows : as a change in the body weight ( table 1 ) and as part of those study participants ( table 2 ) or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( table 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; though observed in both trials over 12 months , weight loss was observed in the first 6 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the average change in total cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( output 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of LD@@ L cholesterol compared with Or@@ li@@ stat 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( output value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
when the wa@@ ist circum@@ ference was the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with Or@@ li@@ stat 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.7 cm ) and plac@@ ebo @-@ 3.6 cm ( base equivalent : 10@@ 3,5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ aboli@@ zed or@@ li@@ stat were not meas@@ ur@@ able after the oral gift of 360 mg or@@ li@@ stat ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7 In general , or@@ li@@ stat could not only be detected in rheumat@@ oid arthritis in plasma and extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of a grief . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

energy is also measured in kil@@ oj@@ oules which can also be found as indication of the packaging of foods . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake can be found as many calories you should take maximum per day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see the tables below in this section called tables . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat , which you should take with any meal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what amount for you is suitable , take the below information that indicates the number of calories that is suitable for you . • Due to the mode of action , compliance with recommended fat intake is crucial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body can not process the amount of fat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to adher@@ ence to recommended fat intake , you can reduce weight loss and reduce the probability of nutritional @-@ related accompanying symptoms . • You should try to gradually increase gradually . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more active you are , the higher is your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; low physical activity &quot; means that you can work daily 150 kcal per day , e.g. by moving daily or other physical activity , e.g. by 3 km walking , 30 - to 45 minute cycling work or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • For long lasting loss , it is necessary to set realistic cal@@ orie and fat goals and hold this also meaningful . • Imag@@ ine a dietary supplement with information about the cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • Imag@@ ine more to move , before you start using all@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the all@@ i program for supporting weight loss combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you to feed cal@@ orie and fet@@ ters , to be physically active . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in combination with a customized program to support weight loss , this information can help you to develop a health@@ ier lifestyle and reach your target weight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alo@@ xi is applied for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( as cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , and vom@@ iting ( like cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , and vom@@ iting ( like cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ ine or car@@ b@@ op@@ la@@ tin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the extra gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an antioxidant ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application of patients under 18 years of age are not recommended , as the effects in this age group doesn &apos;t have enough information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the active ingredient reveals the bond of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alo@@ xi was examined in three main studies of 1 8@@ 42 adults , receiving chemotherapy regim@@ ens which are strong or moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during chemotherapy , a strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting were , 59 % of patients treated with al@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 132 from 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in chemotherapy , 81 % of patients treated with al@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 153 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 153 from 185 ) were treated with chemotherapy regim@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; March 2005 , the European Commission issued the company Helsin@@ n Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a permit for the placing of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : for prevention of acute nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in strongly fluctu@@ ating chemotherapy and prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in moderate chemotherapy due to cancer disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , which is induc@@ ed by a highly sensitive chemotherapy , can be ampli@@ fied by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on @-@ tim@@ eline , patients with am@@ ne@@ sty ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a subtle I@@ le@@ us should be monitored after injection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , like with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , caution is advisable to extend the Q@@ T interval or for patients with which the Q@@ T interval is extended or which tend to such an extension . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; except in connection with another chemical product , Alo@@ xi is neither used to measure nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in the days of chemotherapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in pre@@ clinical trials , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit tum@@ ors of the five evaluated chemotherapy , cy@@ clo@@ atin , cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical study showed no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous dose Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ pl@@ ess concentration of Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experiences on the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron by human gest@@ ation is not present , therefore , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied during pregnancy , unless it is considered to be treated by the doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials the most common adverse events were observed with a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least possibly had some head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity and reactions on performance ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were stated in post @-@ marketing experiences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the group with the highest dosage , similar qualities of adverse events demonstrated as in the other do@@ cks groups ; there were no dose of activity to observe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no di@@ aly@@ sis trials were carried out due to the great distribution volume but probably no effective therapy with a Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dosage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1.@@ 132 patients with ≤ 50 mg / m2 , or@@ b@@ op@@ la@@ tin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 m@@ g. of c@@ on@@ os@@ z@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron was given intraven@@ ously at day 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients were received with ≥ 60 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ azine , as well as 250 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ azine , received 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , received at day 1 intraven@@ ously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
results of the studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with heavy @-@ based chemotherapy are combined in the following tables .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials for indication of chemotherapy @-@ induc@@ ed nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ z@@ ron were comparable with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the findings , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ z@@ ron has the ability to block I@@ zone kan@@ äle into the v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the study conducted during 221 healthy subjects carried out by 221 healthy subjects were the evaluation of the EC@@ G effects of i.@@ v. and administered fl@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.0@@ 25 mg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after an initial decrease in plasma concentrations , a slow elim@@ ination from the body resulted in an average delivery time of approximately 40 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration era curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) is generally in total dose ranges of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patient dos@@ ages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ z@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses higher average ( ± SD ) increase of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic sim@@ ulations , that at once daily intraven@@ ous gift of 0.@@ 25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron had reached a total value of 0.@@ 75 mg . however , the C@@ max was higher after the import of 0.@@ 75 mg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 40 % are eliminated through the kidneys , and roughly 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ abol@@ ites who have in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ z@@ ron over less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recep@@ tor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in @-@ vitro studies regarding the metabolism have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and , in lower extent the I@@ so@@ dic CY@@ P3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in Met@@ abol@@ ism by Pal@@ on@@ os@@ z@@ ron .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elim@@ ination According to an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ gram / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found about 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in urine , made approximately 40 % of the prescribed dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a unique intraven@@ ous bolt injection the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min , and ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although patients with severe liver function distur@@ bs the termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ a mon@@ day and the average system@@ ic exposure with p@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , however , it is not justified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered adequate about the maximum human therapeutic exposition which indicates a low relev@@ ance for clinical use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 10 out of these clinical trials , indications that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can be blocked only in very high concentrations of ion@@ ic channels , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high doses Pal@@ on@@ os@@ z@@ ron ( each dose ent@@ ails in about to 30 @-@ times of therapeutic exposure of human tum@@ ors , end@@ oc@@ rine Ne@@ oplas@@ men ( in thy@@ roid gland , pan@@ cre@@ as , pan@@ cre@@ as , epi@@ der@@ mis ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats but not in mice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dosing and since Alo@@ xi is intended for one @-@ time application , the relev@@ ance of these results is minimal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the owner of this approval must inform the European Commission on the plans for the inclusion of the medicine within the scope of this decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June 2006 , the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) approved a negative opinion in which the approval of approval for the treatment of hepatitis C is recommended by Alph@@ at@@ 6 million IE / ml inj@@ ections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that Alph@@ at@@ eon should re@@ semble a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same generally effective ingredient that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference guide &quot; ) .
Alph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a viral infection caused by viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scop@@ ic examination the liver tissue damage occurs in addition the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ v@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) levels are increased in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast in which an gene ( DNA ) was introduced to stimul@@ ate them to the formation of active substance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the manufacturer of Alph@@ sa presented data on the basis of Alph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active substance , composition and purity of the drugs , mode of action , safety and efficacy of hepatitis C ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study of patients with Hepatitis C , the efficacy of Alph@@ at@@ eon was compared to 4@@ 55 patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study , how many patients were measured after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after treatment on the drug ( i.e. no signs of virus in blood ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , concerns are expressed in detail that data on the stability of the active substance and the drug market is not sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the number of patients suffering from hepatitis C , which were treated with Alph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after setting the treatment with Alph@@ at@@ ax@@ ing , the disease was ret@@ ard@@ ant on more patients than on the reference medium ; Alph@@ at@@ eon also had more side effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from that , the test included in the study , if the drug forms a immune response ( i.e. the body forms a immune response - special proteins - opposed to the medicine ) , not adequ@@ ately vali@@ dated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ zo@@ o ( a skin infection ) and small infected Laz@@ er@@ ations ( cra@@ cking or cutting down ) , ten@@ sions and paraly@@ sed wounds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections be det@@ ectable or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ ine @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ coc@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because al@@ go against this kind of infections might not be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from age of nine months , but in cases under the age of 18 , the skin surface should not be more than 2 % of the body surface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the patient does not appe@@ aled to treatment for two to three days , the physician should examine the patient again and apply alternative treatments into consideration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ oms ( the parts of bacter@@ i@@ ence in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indic@@ ative of the efficacy was performed in all five studies of patients whose infection was delayed by the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.3 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients under Plac@@ ebo spoke to the treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the treatment of infected Hau@@ tw@@ ins , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar contact : if the results were taken together at Hau@@ tw@@ ins , about 90 % of the patients were treated on the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these two studies , however , that al@@ ar@@ go was diagnosed in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ ow@@ ls ( v@@ owed cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections , which have been proven or presumably taken by MR@@ SA , not effective enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common side effect with alt@@ ar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irritation at the location .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of al@@ tar@@ go in the short @-@ surface skin infections could be ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the risk : • Im@@ pe@@ zo@@ o , • infected small in@@ gen@@ ations , ten@@ sions or stit@@ ched wounds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission issued G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . a approval for In@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients receiving any improvement within two to three days , should be examined even again and considered to be considered an alternative therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of sen@@ sibility or severe local irritation , the treatment of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment , the treatment is canc@@ eled and the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully con@@ scienti@@ ous and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not intended to be used to treat infections where MR@@ SA is known as path@@ ogen or susp@@ ects ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies with secondary infected wounds the effectiveness of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections found by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ coc@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) were in@@ sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an alternative therapy is to be considered , if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the effects of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the low plasma concentrations , which were reached in human application based on ag@@ re skin or infected superf@@ icial wounds , is a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
3 After con@@ current gift of 2 times a day 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol the average Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment increased by 1 % ret@@ ard@@ ine of healthy adult males by 81 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the low system@@ ic exposure to top@@ ical application in patients , dose adap@@ tations are not required if top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin are applied during a system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P3@@ A4 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; animal studies have shown a reproduction of reproduction according to oral intake , and are in@@ sufficient in terms of statement on the birth and fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see paragraph 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment should only be applied during pregnancy when a top@@ ographic anti @-@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is the gift of a system@@ ic anti@@ biot@@ ic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in decision , whether the breast@@ feeding is continued / terminated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / killed , between the benefit of a nursing child and the benefit of alt@@ ar@@ go therapy for the woman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with superf@@ icial skin infections , the alt@@ ar@@ go , the most frequently reported side effects of irritation , was about 1 % of patients entered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi@@ synthetic derivatives of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isol@@ ating through fermentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly called Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mode of action of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective inhi@@ bit of bacterial protein synthesis against a certain li@@ aison of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ oms unit which differs from the ties of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ ag@@ ier@@ ating anti@@ bacterial substances .
data suggest that the binding post @-@ Bosnian protein L@@ 3 is involved and in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om P li@@ aison office and the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase@@ Web area .
by binding on this binding p@@ and@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line to inhi@@ bit the pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ ti@@ line to block partially P @-@ binding inter@@ actions and prevent normal education of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om sub units .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance in the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms , an advice should be targeted by experts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the Isol@@ ate were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of failure to treatment with S.@@ au@@ re@@ us the presence of tribes with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study of healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ oc@@ ulin o@@ int@@ a daily was put on intact and applied skin for up to 7 days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , the 1 % ret@@ ap@@ oc@@ ulin daily received twice a day for top@@ ical treatment of secondary infected trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in days 3 or 4 , sampling during adult patients were performed before medi@@ ation and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however the maximum individual system@@ ic recording at humans after top@@ ical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment is reduced to 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 n@@ g ( h / ml ) 660 @-@ times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP inhibit@@ ors .
metabolism of the human liver micro@@ som@@ a in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in studies on oral tox@@ icity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were conducted over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in @-@ vitro examination on gen@@ om@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ ly@@ mph@@ oma test and in the rats @-@ micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo test chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there was neither male nor female signs of reduced fer@@ til@@ ity at oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day so that the most appreciated exposition in humans ( top@@ ical application on 200 c@@ m2 ) was achieved :
in an embr@@ y@@ otic ox@@ icity study at oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) ; develop@@ mental tox@@ icity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ern@@ ally Tox@@ icity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the holder of the approval must be ensured that a pharmac@@ ov@@ ig@@ il@@ ance system is present as in the 1.@@ 8.1 of the application application ( version 6.2 ) , before the product is mark@@ eted and as long as the product is applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the holder was obliged to perform more detailed studies and additional pharmac@@ ov@@ ig@@ il@@ ance activities , as described in version 1 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) and all additional updates of the R@@ MP , which will be arranged with CH@@ MP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as described in CH@@ MP &quot; Gui@@ del@@ ine on Risk Management Systems for Human use , &quot; the updated R@@ MP is scheduled to be submitted simultaneously with the next Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; irritation or other signs and symptoms show in the treated position , you should finish the application of Al@@ tar@@ go and talk to your doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not apply other o@@ int@@ ments , cre@@ ams or l@@ otions on the area that is treated with Al@@ tar@@ go , if not expressly prescribed by your doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must not be applied in the eyes , mouth or lips , in the nose or in the female genital area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the o@@ int@@ ment comes from re@@ viewing on one of these faces , wash the spot with water and ask your physician to advice if complaints occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after applying the o@@ int@@ ment , you may cover the affected area with a ster@@ ile band@@ age or a Gaz@@ ebo cover , unless your doctor has advised you to cover the area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is offered in an aluminium tube with a plastic lock that contains 5 , 10 or 15 grams of o@@ int@@ ment , or in a w@@ allet , containing 0.5 g o@@ int@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis C and hepatitis B ( diseases which affect the liver ) in children between one and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix is applied to one of two doses of existing vacc@@ ines , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved before entering the second dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used when immun@@ isation consists of a low risk of hepatitis B infection and ensures that it can be ro@@ uted from two doses to an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a inj@@ ector is requested against hepatitis C or B , Ambi@@ rix or any other Hepatitis A@@ - or -@@ B vaccine can be given . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vacc@@ ines have an effect on the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) , &quot; as it can fight against a disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after receiving a child , the immune system recogni@@ zes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and creates anti@@ bodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the vacc@@ ines have been accredited since 1996 , and the vacc@@ ines have been accredited since 1997 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three vacc@@ ines are applied to protect against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adult and Twin@@ rix children are administered in the framework of a three doses of existing vacc@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adult contains identical ingredients , some of the data provided by Twin@@ rix adult is also used as proof of the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main indic@@ ator for efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a month after the last injection of protective anti@@ bodies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an additional study with 208 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with six months and a 12 month distance between the two inj@@ ections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ambi@@ rix carried out between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection of protecting anti@@ bodies against hepatitis A and B .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the additional study showed that the level of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar to a six @-@ month distance between the injection of the injection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( ob@@ serves more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are head@@ ache , loss of appetite , redness , mat@@ h ( fatigue ) and irrit@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix may be in patients that are potentially sensitive ( allergic ) to the active agents , one of the other components or Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) are not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in August 2002 , the European Commission issued G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ ame s.@@ a. a permit for In@@ duc@@ tive ambi@@ rix in the entire region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the standardi@@ zation plan for the basic immun@@ isation with ambi@@ rix consists of two vaccine doses , whereby the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose to be given after the first dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a refresh@@ ment is requested for Hepatitis B as well as for Hepatitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated by means of the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination of combination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the anti @-@ hepatitis B coating ( anti @-@ hepatitis ) anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen levels ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ AM@@ F ) and anti @-@ hepatitis C virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti@@ bodies lie in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not yet completely secured if immun@@ competent individuals who have demanded on a hepatitis A@@ - imp@@ fung , which may be protected by immun@@ ological memory as well as protection against the immun@@ ological memory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 As in all inj@@ ections , an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the injection of the vaccine therapy options should always be available immediately after medical treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a fast protection against hepatitis B is necessary , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended with the combination material that contains 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the immune system , no harmful anti @-@ HAV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibody is reached , so that in these cases the gift of other vaccine doses may be required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intra@@ muscular administration could lead to a subtle vacc@@ ination , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in cases of thro@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood co@@ ag@@ ulation , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected into an exception of sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ ections , as in these cases , after intra@@ muscular administration to occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Ambi@@ rix was given in the second year of a separate injection at the same time with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ a- , tet@@ ra@@ ins and az@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza type vaccine was the immune response to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with immun@@ os@@ supp@@ ress@@ ful therapy or in patients with immune defects , it may be assumed that possibly no sufficient immune response is achieved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccine doses of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , sw@@ elling , mat@@ h , gast@@ ro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ ache and fever was comparable to the frequency that was observed in the earlier Thi@@ omer@@ ang sal@@ - and preser@@ vative vaccine formulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vaccine doses were administered at a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ination at the age of 1 to 15 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to 15 , the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ doses of combination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ ur@@ ation on a calculation basis per vacc@@ ination dose Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix at 50@@ .@@ 7 % of the test subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.1 % in subjects according to the gift of a 3 @-@ doses of combination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the entire vaccine cycle , 6@@ 6.4 % of prob@@ ands were given to the ambi@@ rix meeting with pain , compared with 6@@ 3,@@ 8 % in the test subjects which had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the frequency of mat@@ uri@@ osity was comparable per pro@@ band ( i.e. above the whole vaccine ) received 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of volunteers , compared with 3@@ 6.2 % among the subjects , which received the 3 doses of combination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incidence of pronounced pain and mat@@ ity was low , comparable to the combination of combination of combination with the 3 doses should be observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a compar@@ ative study with 1- and 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ination , the occurrence of locomotive response and general actions with 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ ert activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface treatment was observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , after vacc@@ ination with ambi@@ rix an frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per commission , was reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proportion of vacc@@ ines that reported on severe side effects during the 2 doses of intra@@ corneal in@@ as@@ on@@ eme with the combination of 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface finishing , was statisti@@ cally different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials that were conducted at vacc@@ ines at age 1 to including 15 years , Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sion@@ rates were given a month after the first dose and 100 % a month following the first dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the first dose and 100 % a month after the first dose and a month after the second dose , the Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sion@@ al rates were given 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7 In a compar@@ ative study , which was conducted at 12 - including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combination fuel with three doses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the 289 persons , whose immun@@ ogen@@ icity was evaluated ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 , according to the gift of the 3 @-@ dose imp@@ lic@@ ates significantly higher than with ambi@@ rix . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immune response , which were achieved in a clinical study study at 1- and 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after the ending of the full vaccine series ( i.e. , month 7 ) are listed in the following table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both trials , the vacc@@ inations received either a 2 doses scheme with ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses scheme with a combination of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ ert activated hepatitis B virus and 10@@ µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for people who were at the time of the pri@@ ori@@ zation of 12 to 15 years old , the per@@ sist@@ ence of anti @-@ HAV@@ - and Anti @-@ H@@ BS antibody could be detected at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation with ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immune response to both anti@@ gens was comparable to both anti@@ gens of 3 doses with a combination of combination of a combination of 360 ELISA units which was found in a combination of 360 ELISA units which has been as@@ cer@@ ated in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical study from 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ old @-@ olds , the per@@ sist@@ ence of anti @-@ HAV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS @-@ anti@@ bodies are comparable to that in the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ination scheme . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the first dose of ambi@@ rix in the second year of life coinci@@ ded with the ch@@ imp@@ fung of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ a- , tet@@ ra@@ ins and az@@ ell@@ ular disease ( DT@@ Pa @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les @-@ m@@ umps vaccine was the immune response to all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the present formulation in adults was shown for the present formulation similar to Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ek@@ - and ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sion@@ ing as for the earlier formulation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vaccine is to examine both before and after the res@@ us@@ en@@ code by eye per@@ missions , to any other foreign particles and / or physical visible changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hepatitis @-@ A virus is usually transmitted through viral containing foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways such as by bath in water @-@ temper@@ ate waters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you may feel very tired , have a dark urine , an infl@@ amed face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that possibly make a stationary treatment necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not fully protect from an infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vaccine series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you / your child are infected with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus infected with hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus ( although you / her child does not feel un@@ comfortable or ill ) may not be vacc@@ ination from vacc@@ ination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a protection against other infections , liver damage or symptoms which are similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection , can not be convey@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • When your child has an allergic reaction to ambi@@ rix , or any part of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) has shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an allergic reaction can occur through it@@ ching ra@@ ins , breath @-@ not or stimulation of the face or tongue . • if you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis C or hepatitis B . • If you / your child have a severe infection with fever .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B , i.e. within six months and usually intended to take the second vacc@@ ination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from one vacc@@ ination with ambi@@ rix . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , it will recommend to you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined Hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine from a combined content of effective ingredients per vaccine doses ( 360 ELISA units of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second vaccine dose of this vaccine is administered at low content , usually administered a month after the first dose and should give you a vacc@@ ination against end of the vaccine series . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected in people who suffer from severe blood cl@@ am@@ ination to suffer from the skin and not into the muscle or treatment in your own body or if you / your child are under@@ taking a ha@@ fl@@ aly@@ sis / under@@ takes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but immune response of these people may not be sufficient to see that a blood test can be necessary to see how strongly respon@@ ding to vacc@@ ination is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 21 Be your doctor if you / your child is taken away for further drugs ( including those that have been given without prescri@@ ption ) or if you have been given without prescri@@ ption , or if you have been planned or have planned them in the near future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if another vaccine must be given at the same time with ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and if possible different limbs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Ambi@@ rix should be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of Imm@@ ac@@ lob@@ ul@@ ys , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually , ambi@@ rix is not given pregnant or l@@ act@@ ating women , except it is urg@@ ently necessary to vacc@@ inated both against hepatitis C and hepatitis B . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please tell your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiot@@ ic ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , contact your doctor and make a new appointment as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

♦ frequent ( up to 1 case per 10 doses ) : • sw@@ elling at the injection site • fever ( over 38 ° C ) • Use of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal dis@@ comfort
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further adverse events , the days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combined or single vacc@@ inations against hepatitis C and hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10.000 branches ) have been reported , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these include local or extensive precip@@ itation , that can be or b@@ ash@@ able , sw@@ elling of the eye @-@ partial or swal@@ lowing , sudden blood pressure and awareness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the data , which has become known for the first permit for the first license , CH@@ MP has reported that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for ambi@@ rix remains positive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , since ambi@@ rix was placed in traffic in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited by low patient @-@ exposure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am@@ mon@@ aps can be used in patients at age over one month , with hyper@@ ammon@@ ium oxide ( brain damage due to high levels of ammon@@ i@@ ority ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
am@@ ne@@ aps is - divided into several individual doses to the meals - swal@@ lowed under the food mixed or over a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ es@@ hips ( by the abdominal wall in the stomach &apos;s leading hose ) or administered by the nose into the stomach &apos;s leading hose ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a compar@@ ative study , since ammon@@ ite could not be compared with another treatment or plac@@ ebo ( a head@@ way or without active substance ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps can also cause loss of appetite , a abnormal acid content in blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , lack of flavor , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash or weight gain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that am@@ mon@@ aps in patients with regard to high levels of ammonia is effectively prevented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am@@ mon@@ rap@@ es@@ eed was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; due to the disease of the disease , limited information on this medicine was presented at the time of approval . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use is indicated in all patients , where a complete enc@@ l@@ man is already manifest@@ ed already in new@@ born ( within the first 28 life days ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with a late @-@ solid form ( in@@ complete enc@@ ir@@ l defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first life of life ) , there is an indication of hyper@@ acidity as@@ ep@@ hal@@ opathy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for babies , for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS are also available in gran@@ ular form . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the daily dose is calculated individually , considering the protein toler@@ ance and the daily protein intake of the patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 g / m ² / day in children with a weight of 20 kg as well as for growing and adults .
in patients who suffer from an early respiratory lack of carb@@ amide phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ trans@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e is the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ é lin or Arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an in@@ in@@ ine uc@@ cin@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency needs to receive arg@@ in@@ ine in a dose of 0,4 @-@ 0.7 g / kg / h or 8,8 - 15,@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are not allowed to treat patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as a risk for the emergence of o@@ es@@ oph@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets are not absorbed immediately into the stomach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be applied to patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure and with sodium discharge and eyel@@ et formation only with caution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Met@@ abol@@ ism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ al occurs over the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme caution when patients with liver or kidney failure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the meaning of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal pro@@ liferation and increased loss of neur@@ ons came . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cer@@ eb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning ner@@ ves in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could not be noticed if phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is eliminated in humans into the breast milk and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , at least 56 % of patients entered at least an undes@@ irable event ( AU ) and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not connected with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 ; &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an unlikely @-@ toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year old an@@ o@@ retinal female patient , with lac@@ tic hypo@@ kal@@ emia , heavier hypo@@ kal@@ emia , peripheral new rop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ atitis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of an over@@ dose , an over@@ dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) was observed with an acci@@ dental dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these symptoms coinci@@ de with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate that showed intraven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ is@@ limit@@ ing neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ aboli@@ zed active compound associated with acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine using acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted over the kidneys .
Stö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally is comparable with urea ( both links contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore also suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with dys@@ functions of the ur@@ inary bladder can be assumed that a sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate between 0.0@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine can be produced for each gram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is of meaning that the diagnosis is early early and the treatment is started , in order to improve survival chances and clinical results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the progn@@ osis of the early modified form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in new@@ born and primary amino acids , and the disease led to death with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids within the first year of life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative trails in nitrogen oxi@@ di@@ ate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ di@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , prot@@ ein@@ ated co@@ operative and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids ( however , within the first life of life ) diagnosed patients to 80 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients suffering from patients whose illness was diagnosed in pregnancy and the survival rate was 100 % , but even in those patients it occurred with many too mental disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in patients with a late @-@ solid form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ trans@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e ) that were treated permanently with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ al and a prot@@ ein@@ ated diet . the survival rate was 98 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical status may occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl@@ ates is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidneys with glut@@ amine and phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is formed .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ al and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined by so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ al and its metabol@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in cancer patients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after an oral solo dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ al in tray form , 15 minutes after taking meas@@ ur@@ able plasma concentrations have been established by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the majority of patients with urea cyc@@ lical distur@@ ban@@ ces or hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ aries ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) the next morning is no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the blood plasma bar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl@@ tin ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) were treated five times higher than after the first gifts on the third day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is ex@@ cre@@ ted over the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ al with toxic and non @-@ toxic effects ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is either taken oral ( infants and children not swallow by swal@@ lowed or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or over a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ es@@ hips or a nos@@ son@@ ville .
according to previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , babies and children with a weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 g / m ² / day in children with a weight of 20 kg as well as for growing and adults .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched in amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um prot@@ eine in the plasma should be held within the normal area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in patients who suffer from an early respiratory lack of carb@@ amide phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ trans@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e is the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ é lin or Arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ al each containing 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when rat feder@@ ates were subjected to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active met@@ aboli@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl@@ tin ) , there came to l@@ esi@@ ons in the py@@ rami@@ ds of the c@@ ort@@ ex . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an unlikely @-@ toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year old an@@ o@@ retinal female patient , with lac@@ tic hypo@@ kal@@ emia , heavier hypo@@ kal@@ emia , peripheral new rop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ atitis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ry is comparable with urea ( both links contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore also suitable as an alternative support for ex@@ cre@@ tion from excess .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary bladder can be produced , between 0.0@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen can be produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are barely reversible , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical status may occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after an oral solo dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ al in gran@@ ular form , 15 minutes after taking meas@@ ur@@ able plasma concentrations have been established by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the duration of durability , the patient can uniqu@@ ely store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of over 25 ° C. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this procedure the small measuring spoon contains 0.@@ 95 g ; the average measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ al .
if a patient must receive the medication over a probe you can also dissolve AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS before use in water ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ al amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they accumul@@ ate the sti@@ cking waste products which accumul@@ ate after consumption of proteins in the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if using laboratory tests , you will need to inform the doctor that you can use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ al can influence the results of specific laboratory tests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or if it is not prescribed for prescri@@ ption medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during lac@@ tation period , you must not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as the medicine could harm the breast milk and harm your baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in rare instances , fu@@ sions , head@@ ache , flav@@ ours , indul@@ gence of au@@ tism , disin@@ teg@@ ration , memory disorders and wor@@ sen@@ ing existing neurolog@@ ical states were observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you determine one of these symptoms , you immediately get in contact with your doctor or to your hospital &apos;s quotes for the purpose of an appropriate treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you forget the dose of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dosage as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changes in blood bil@@ ty ( red blood cells , thro@@ at@@ ocy@@ tes ) , dimin@@ ished appetite , cause pain , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , kidney failure , weight gain and an@@ om@@ al laboratory values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects will affect you significantly , or you may notice any side effects listed in this manual information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS following the box on the cardboard and the container , &quot; using the specified use date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , the contents of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of white colour and oval shape and they are equipped with the embos@@ sing &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 If at you laboratory investigations , you will need to inform the doctor that you can take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ al can influence the results of specific laboratory tests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or if it is not prescribed for prescri@@ ption medicine .
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS in the same individual doses of oral or via a ga@@ stri@@ c ( hose that runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a Nas@@ en@@ son@@ de ( hose that is caused by the nose into the stomach ) .

An@@ gi@@ ox is applied to treat patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ sy@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) or for instance in unstable ang@@ ina ( a heart attack ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( a an@@ om@@ al measuring value for the electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if An@@ gi@@ ox is applied to preventing blood cl@@ ots in patients who are given a higher dose , and the in@@ fusion can be continued till four hours after the procedure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack , this can contribute to the heart of blood flow and increase the effectiveness of a PCI . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS with the effect of angi@@ det@@ ox with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I ) with conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ um ) and a GP@@ I was compared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the PCI the patient was often used a St@@ ent ( a short tube that ob@@ tains in the ar@@ tery , and in addition , they received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and A@@ spir@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the Gift of GP@@ I - for preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or re@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or one year as well as conventional treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients who subjected to a PCI to all indicators such as He@@ par@@ in , with the exception of severe bleeding , with which there was much more effective than he@@ par@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; An@@ gi@@ ox may not be applied in patients who may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , other brain plants or one of the other ingredients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , it must not be applied in patients who recently had a blood flow as well as with people with strong hypertension or kidney problems or a cardi@@ ac infection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is responsible for the treatment of ACS and during a PCI is an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd with approval for In@@ jection of An@@ gi@@ ox across the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ sy@@ dro@@ mes ( unstable / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) for an emergency handle or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initial dose of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous bolt of 0,1 mg / kg was followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an additional PCI is carried out in a row , additional Bol@@ us should be given of 0.5 mg / kg and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the PCI requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose ranges from 0,@@ 25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately before the procedure , a sl@@ ur@@ ry of 0.5 mg / kg was administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recommended dose of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight and a weight of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety and effectiveness of a sole bol@@ us @-@ gift of An@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended , even if a short PCI procedure is planned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) was shortened to under 225 seconds and should take a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to reduce the occurrence lower ACT values , the con@@ stituted and diluted product should carefully be mixed with intraven@@ ously before application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the ACT value amounts to more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is not required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is given correctly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with moderate kidney failure ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) ( whether treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) should be used to use a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the ACT value is under 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg can be given once again and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage , included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( replace @-@ 2 ) , the ACT value was 5 minutes according to the gift of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment to average , 366 ± 89 seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
3 patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and on di@@ aly@@ sis patients is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the treatment with angi@@ ox can be induc@@ ed after completion of the intraven@@ ous injection of in@@ frac@@ tured he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of lower He@@ par@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or other ingredients or against de@@ ud@@ ine bleeding caused by a distur@@ b@@ ance of hem@@ ost@@ asis and / or ir@@ reversible effects of cardi@@ ac disease . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients are carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age , especially if Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine is given in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if the PCI @-@ patient occur under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in most of the arter@@ ies of the arter@@ ial points can occur in patients who occur in per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ar@@ intervention ( PCI ) , while the treatment of principle occur everywhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients receiving war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ valent ( International standardi@@ zation ) , in order to ensure that the value after de@@ position treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine should be achieved before the treatment existing level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proce@@ eding from the knowledge of the mechanism of anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te units ) can be assumed that these compounds increase blood risk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the combination of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ ten@@ ants or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants are the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ ase@@ parameters of each case regularly to control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the experimental studies are in@@ sufficient in relation to the pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , in@@ feed or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in Group as well as in patients with He@@ par@@ in , there were more likely to adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
severe bleeding were performed after the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding as shown in table 2 .
both light and heavy hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages performed under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in alone significantly lower than in the groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ inhibit@@ or and GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
a AC@@ U@@ ITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ ocular , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age . the reduction of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ed of ≥ 3 g / l with well @-@ known hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age or re@@ distribution of blood products to trans@@ fusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further , less frequently observed blood g@@ loc@@ alities that were up to more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other scores , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gast@@ ro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following data on adverse events are based on data from a clinical study of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , with 6,000 patients who undergo a PCI . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in Group and in patients treated with He@@ par@@ in , there were more likely to adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both light and heavy hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages continued to significantly lower than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ inhibit@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following effects listed above are listed above , according to a comprehensive application in practice and are summar@@ ised in Table 6 according to systems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of over@@ dosing , treatment with bi@@ valent ( Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in ) is able to break in immediately and to monitor the patient with regard to signs of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a direct and specific Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in@@ in@@ or which bin@@ ds both in the cataly@@ tic centre and on the animal @-@ binding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in regardless of whether the thro@@ mb@@ in is bound to a liquid phase or to straight cl@@ ots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and with that its effect , is reversible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in develops slowly up the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine @-@ arg@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 through which the function of the active center of thro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , teenagers and children aged six years with diabetes , having a treatment with insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected to sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall or arm as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diabetes is a disease when the body does not in@@ sufficient insulin for the glucose of glucose ( sugar ) , or the insulin can not be effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; insulin @-@ is@@ in differs very slightly from human@@ kind , and the change means that it acts faster and a shorter duration of activity has a short @-@ effective human insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in combination with diabetes type 1 diabetes , A@@ pi@@ dra has been investigated in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body can produce no insulin , in two studies with 5@@ 72 children aged four and 17 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of type 2 diabetes , in which the body of insulin has not been effectively processed , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study with 8@@ 78 adults . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main indic@@ ator for efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cer@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.3 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was detected in a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % compared with insulin for six months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in adults with type 2 diabetes the reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ pi@@ dra should not be applied to patients who are potentially sensitive ( allergic ) against insulin @-@ ul@@ is@@ in or one of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cans of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adapted , if it is administered along with a number of other medicines which can affect the glucose level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH , approved an approval for the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the field of abdominal wall or to apply sub@@ cut@@ aneous to continuous in@@ fusion to the area of abdominal de@@ - C@@ KE .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to reduced glucose levels and decreased insulin production , the insulin requirement may be reduced in patients with a limitation of the liver function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any change of active substance , the brand ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin , etc . ) , can change the insulin demand change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 A in@@ sufficient dosage or treatment , in particular in patients with an ins@@ ul@@ in@@ able diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and a di@@ abe@@ tic it@@ eto@@ ids , which conditions are potentially li@@ threat@@ ening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of a patient on another insulin type or a insulin pump should be done under strict medical supervision , and may require a change in the dosage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the timing of a hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the mode profile of the used insulin , and can therefore change in changing the treatment sch@@ emas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the substances that increase blood glucose levels and increase the tendency to hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ics , fibro@@ my@@ cot@@ ox@@ in , anti@@ co@@ xy@@ lic acid , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ lic acid , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , under the effect of symp@@ ha@@ oly@@ tics such as beta @-@ block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ id@@ ine , gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ ine and Reser@@ pine may be weakened or missing the symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ tic@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the experimental studies for reproduction of reproduction showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human@@ ization regarding the pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see paragraph 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not known whether there is insulin inj@@ is@@ in to human breast milk , but in general insulin occurs neither into the breast milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ ated after oral application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

severe Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ sions with awareness can be given by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) which is given by a doctor or administered intraven@@ ous gift of glucose by a doctor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following a glu@@ ing injection , the patient should be supervised in a hospital to determine the pre@@ - matter for the heavy hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
insulin lowers blood sugar level by stimul@@ ating the peripheral glucose absorption ( especially through skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) and by inhibit@@ ing glucose in the liver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous gau@@ ging of insulin , the activity takes place faster and the duration of activity is shorter than with hu@@ gely normal insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
