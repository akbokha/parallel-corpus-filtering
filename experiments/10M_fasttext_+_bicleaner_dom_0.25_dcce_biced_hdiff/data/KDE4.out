you can also filter the Con@@ stance Filter module ( also called folder filters ) in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under ex@@ tras : you can filter &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory on different kinds .
to view the DO@@ M tree view at &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; select Extras DO@@ M tree to view ... and open up a new window with the DO@@ M of the just displayed page . as default starts the display with the DO@@ M folder . all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root tray .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; for another view of objects with the M@@ IM@@ E @-@ Type I@@ node / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative to the various symbol and text views to view the contents of your local fil@@ esystem .
the pec@@ uli@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; contains the display of the size of objects in stored structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle shape with its size . this size must have the sum of the size of the sub@@ ordin@@ ated objects of an object smaller or equal to the size of the object .
with &amp; FS@@ View ; the size of a file or folder represents the size of a folder than the sum of the size of the file . consequently you can easily be recognized as the sum of the size of the file . consequently you can easily be recognized as a graphical and interactive version of the folder hierarchy .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap form a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your file system . for simpler navigation use the rec@@ tan@@ gles of meaningful color and labelling settings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the color of a rect@@ angle , that is turned over color mode , can either be depth for the easy detection of the casing depth or the figure of another file name like name , owner , group or M@@ IM@@ E type . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the various features of the corresponding file or folder , if there is enough space for displaying at all . moreover you can define the relative position of let@@ tering in the rect@@ angle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Dar@@ em@@ ap for Tre@@ em@@ aps the rule should be maintained which is not always available to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , there will be no place where the sub@@ ordin@@ ate should not be lost when the square is square . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to inform the size of an entry for the sub@@ ordin@@ ated entries , the implementation is provided for the lab@@ eling and avoiding loss of space by always beneficial the surfaces need to be formed as quadra@@ tic . these are the best methods for lines , columns or recur@@ sive second . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can indicate the minimum displayed area for an entry on the menu entry to the area . instead , a sample pattern is shown in the area of an over@@ ar@@ ded entry to indicate that the area is actually allocated by an ordin@@ ate entry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally &amp; FS@@ View was designed , as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets , which was developed for using K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ rin@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

modern digital cameras are used for data transmission through the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for the actual transfer to the machine . older cameras may also be used for connection to serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; digi@@ plug , the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 is used for communication with digital cameras that supports an constantly increasing number of 800 cameras , which supports an constantly increasing number of digital cameras to machines and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need of additional drivers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many old digital cameras use serial interface for their communication with the calcul@@ ator . since photos in general are large files and transm@@ is@@ sions over the serial port are slow . &amp; digi@@ plug now supports the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been drawn up with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support and that the EX@@ IF support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photovoltaic system . if the EX@@ IF support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photovoltaic units you may not be able to look very slowly or the generation could be very slow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most beautiful things of &amp; digi@@ plug , is how easy to expand its functionality by modules : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE image plug@@ ins Interface Project ( manual ) is a joint module structure for &amp; digi@@ plug . the aim is to provide the modules with all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as well as a user can be manipul@@ ated ; by writing a small module to complement one function than the changes to &amp; digi@@ plug . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to simplify the window you can either change the side bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change in full screen mode with F@@ 11 and C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
drawing and placing images functions everywhere : you can insert a picture in any other part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ms ; over the horizontal divi@@ ding line or in another application window . the only restriction is that a picture cannot be in rec@@ ess , dat@@ or list or search .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - a file selection allows you to recover the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the text filter is only used for fields that are displayed in the symbol view . so the fil@@ tering is displayed on the fil@@ en@@ ame only when the ind symbol is displayed . which fields are displayed in the dialog box dialog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ que quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums , where they can be stored on the hard disk after the name of their collection in which the album was created first . the date can be changed in the properties of the album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you should notice that it can be saved after editing other image processing programs with the metadata in the image . so , some programs save the EX@@ IF data and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; digi@@ plug , two ways are available for turn . the easiest is to preview and rotating the right mouse button . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can change the location of a keyword by moving it to the desired position in the tree and place there . then there is a menu , which gives you the keyword at a time only once in a tree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can change the properties of a keyword by selecting it with the right mouse button and select the name of the keyword , and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to select another photo as an album symbol , you need to select the picture with the right mouse button and put the photo on the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; order &amp; digi@@ plug has to be able to use keywords , you must first place your photos with keyword in order to pick up your photos by keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can display a photo using any number of keywords . you can choose one keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event , with which it was taken , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you have a photo with keyword , this is shown below the preview of the image in the main window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can remove a keyword in which you can open from the picture with the right mouse button , and remove from the keywords menu . the menu only shows the keywords that were assigned to the photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the time beam view shows a time @-@ dependent hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . to select a time frame you can only click on the lower right angle of the selection procedure . this will display all the related images in the main window .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the box below , you can enter a title and save your selection . this will appear in the list below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; include all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , words , albums , collections , dat@@ est@@ amp and in the future more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neb@@ bi@@ er keyword is a small lamp that will find . if you click here , the fil@@ tering is deleted and all the pictures will be displayed again . then the search is red . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more advanced search tool is hidden in the rider on the left side bar with the bin@@ oc@@ ulars . if you can open it as a Live Search , which always filters you as a search crit@@ erion . after you have saved the ad filter in the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are happy with your selection , press OK and search for your search . the results will select My search list in the main window . if you choose to select your search list in My search list and select a option in your context menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you choose search , select the form for entering your search again . if you select advanced search , the dialog will appear for the advanced search for your previous search . here you will find more rules for the search available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select your search in the context menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Advanced search provides an extended search form with many search parameters available for you in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ plug ; s database can search .
the list of search rules is used to put the options for a search query in the Alb@@ end@@ ow bank . all rules are dealt with by oper@@ ators . any option can be merged with other via the logical operations . any option can be connected with others by type &amp; quot ; AND TH@@ E@@ quot ; create .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; digi@@ plug ; characterized by a long number of a special technique , the hair algorithm . it enables images to compare the difference between two images of the signature . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
similar entries : this is a range in which you can drop every image in order to find a similar . by means of a sponge the result selection can be enlarged and smaller then you can open it over the icon of un@@ easy search in the left side bar and you can drop it back there .
sk@@ etch : clear sk@@ etch color : draw a quick sk@@ etch and &amp; digi@@ plug ; find the right images . also here a sw@@ elling value can be set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this rider sits an intuitive map tool based on the mar@@ ble @-@ thumb@@ nail , or copy it by using the mouse wheel or move it . all images inside the coordinates must be filtered and displayed . this is of course pres@@ umed your pictures encoder data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the box below , you can specify a name for your Ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for a later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ ord@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; digi@@ plug , introducing a separate window available with which you can easily compare images . he works with all supported image file formats , including raw files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choose one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em LED added to the main window . when you are back in the main window , you can open the lumin@@ osity quickly with L Extras . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also compare the images that you want to compare them to the left or right area of the window . if you want to synchron@@ ize information from the tool@@ bar and transfer them to any of the pictures , then you can compare the same range of both pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another mode is better suited to play fast from a series of images , then use the left mouse button at any thumb@@ nail in order to display it on the left . this simpli@@ fies in the right area , through a number of similar images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , normal li@@ tigation are also working directly from the light table as F@@ 4 file ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all image information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both thumb@@ nails in light . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each mountain@@ eering you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ v@@ elling function which you can click to the crossed arrows . in order to preview the visible range of the image you need to preview the picture and the L@@ MB . then both pictures will be displayed in the same image area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; zoom lens works just like in other views . simply use the zoom regulator , under the images or c@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and beyond . this happens in both pictures if you are previ@@ ew@@ ed in the preview mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is a digital stock management ? within the way the picture has been taken into account after the final issue and the permanent storage . each of the photos captured , sc@@ anned or digital photos stores it in a systematic and efficient way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how to secure your images , use , protect , organize , backup , evaluate , evaluate , optimize , maintain , and export image files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; quot ; Digital stock administration takes stock , indicated , categ@@ orized , searches , converted , conf@@ ection , and exports content that can be converted to a mon@@ et@@ root or cultural value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; metadata is defined as data on data . metadata is according to your definition specification , which provide information on or documentation of other data which will be managed by a application or environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I dare to say , if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t need to know how many photos you did , then use the metadata in a database as well as in the image files that you can access to other programs , platforms and formats freely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first thing you do and know what to keep in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to data structure . they must make sure that you have to put them on a reserved drive , or change it at any time you need to change a bigger drive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location . if you have enough pictures , then you will be able to use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
professional photographers have other requirements like ver@@ sion@@ ing of photos , archiving and work flows of images to different themes and a large number of all . within 10 years will have 95 % archives and 5 % work files and you will not want to real@@ ign your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new files from old files .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the separation of original and work files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration , and you will always know if you are searching for an original or a derived image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , we recommend using metadata in the setting page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ plug . this ensures that EX@@ IF data and IP@@ TC data can be stored into the files by clicking on the corresponding item in the menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what if you want to change it ? add a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the main ones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the real work begins , as you now need to select each photo keyword , labels and rating . of course you can select all the pictures that you need to focus on the same attribute . this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now let &apos;s go with words , keywords how you frequently called for other programs or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you import kat@@ zed pictures from another source with embedded sampling ; automatically the tree for you will build up the images to the right place . the changing words are processed by &amp; digi@@ plug , updated while sub@@ tree is being persec@@ uted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the graphic shows how different metadata is cut . this is a very coar@@ se representation , as each block consists of metadata in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ame and calendar data consists of all images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enough the keyword , the next section refers to labels or comments , the third important tool for catalog@@ u@@ stom@@ ed your metadata . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to let most anyone know your photos yourself , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . they are sure to be interested in your photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check out this panorama . from the distance , not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look closer to see some details , people , the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and now I say to you this the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; you may even hear the silence . you may even hear the silence . the writing has completely changed your perception of this panoramic position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for others consider their photos , the title may be more important than the image itself . if you have pictures you should tell a story to tell him about the motif that you are moving to understand what you understand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is okay if a picture is not perfect , if it has the strength to work only with a label for yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with &amp; digi@@ plug you can save as many text in an internation@@ alised alp@@ habet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) as let@@ tering . you can even export it for a selection of pictures at the same time . so you can tell you the story in writing and / or the title of the web gallery .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find in another city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with images the train leaves the spatial presentation now with light speed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can also export the possibilities of ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alisation and can be easily accessed in the future , using pictures with ge@@ ographic maps . you can also export the photos at the reception site . you can also export the images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a vocabulary with copyright and den@@ otes the practice to remove the copyright on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms are also applicable in all changed versions , also for the work of others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following description tells you what information in the Direc@@ tion page of &amp; digi@@ plug has to be deposited as information :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should add your name or the name of the photographer . if it is not requested to protect the identity of the photographer . if it does not be changed to the identity of the photographer . this field does not support comm@@ as nor semic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator .
author ( syn@@ onym for Auth@@ orship ) : associated with the author . this field contains the working name of the photographer . examples of this field holds the title of freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a note to the author &apos;s field , it must be completed as well .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for sellers ) : use the vend@@ or field to identify who offers the photo . if the picture is shown here if the picture is shown here if the picture is shown here if the picture is shown here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright parts , even though they have no need to protect against mis@@ use . anyone who is a little more than the basic knowledge in the image is digital water@@ mark . for individuals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ plug , in the near future there will be a module for batch processing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; topics : record fail@@ ures , plate failure , power failure , EC@@ C , transmission errors , ag@@ eing of the storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , lifetime , size , spread , spread , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that lost on the street or a fire . this kind of loss is the same that will also happen to you by traditional paper pictures or neg@@ atives . in this section , we are dealing with the so @-@ called new media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; roll On@@ es , the world &apos;s biggest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which have reasons for data loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , they must not be handled more than a few years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality . of course , you can claim CDs and DVDs in a lifetime of 100 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CD / DVD disks may be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable than the cheapest way to choose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to errors , even if you are just written to protect you . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for form@@ atting and the check@@ sum@@ s . despite this massive protection they are needed for form@@ atting , ultra@@ violet light , scratches , dust &amp; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for defective CDs and DVDs there &apos;s a cheap program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which appears to perform wonders at CDs and DVDs . there are also similar applications available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged disks , hard disks , flash drives , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks to win the format war against the HD DVD . a dual player Blu @-@ ray disc can store up to 50 GB , and thus it &apos;s true for the Blu @-@ ray disc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make sure you want to copy the media up to the next generation of media in a not appropri@@ ated format . after that , you should copy the data to the next generation of media before using the latest hardware or software you can read these media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flo@@ or@@ manufacturers retain their statistics for themselves . your production guarantees include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study about the error mechanisms of hard disk drives : dis@@ mis@@ erst@@ u@@ das . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly this error occurred in the temperature range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C . with lower temperature correc@@ tions the most common error cause damage . electronic parts of Controller are the most common error cause . these are especially readers and publishing teeth . the expected lifetime of life is between 4 and 5 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only about the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also protect data loss from a current failure before using the files , but these losses can normally be produced without major problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while most electric devices do not make a good deal of devices that can take heavy damage . these can cause serious data loss , complete data loss , hardware detection , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from the non@@ avo@@ id@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most widespread protection against sp@@ ikes is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absorbed a part of energy bar , and it is usually stored in the form of a connector bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , take care of the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this ensures a certain minimum of protection . this ensures that he protects the protection against lighten@@ ing and protects the properly connected devices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an over@@ voltage can use any cable to your computer , you should also ensure that all peripheral devices can be connected to your modem . others provide connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the TV card . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have a notebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a large number of these devices are specially designed for lap@@ tops and therefore also contain the protection for the modem . thus , they are ideal for traveling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while over@@ voltage protection your system protects against smaller variations in the power supply , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can be meaningful to invest in a interrup@@ tible power supply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to protection against over@@ voltage these devices can automatically transfer battery energy , if you have the power failure . some models allow them to work properly . in addition , they will be able to transmit the same quality requirements like a over@@ voltage protection . moreover , the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remember the potential risk that your computer system is suspended and compare his security with the costs of avo@@ idance of this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can cost you as good as your computer . at the end , you should always think all cables before you travel to the holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Amazon Web service includes S3 - simple storage service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to store it as a backup target for your software . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , compared to hard drives at home , however very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost and dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data on a compar@@ atively slow Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the solutions are therefore only a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the photo @-@ community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . your free memory is not available at full resolution online . for $ 25 per year you will get unlimited memories which should only be checked in reality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the web solutions are very safe from the point of view . transmission errors are automatically adjusted , thanks to the TCP protocols and include a secure storage and a distributed memory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the diagram illustr@@ ate the elements of the transmission grid . all transm@@ is@@ sions are pr@@ one to transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem , and b@@ tr@@ fs provide at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the worst thing is that no one has occurred when it happened in your hardware . all these distur@@ ban@@ ces have occurred . all these distur@@ ban@@ ces remain un@@ discovered until you have not thought about it . no one seems to have thought about it . no one appears to be much safer than that in your machine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate intern@@ ments within data flows . in normal file systems this error has un@@ noticed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if you are currently not affected by transm@@ is@@ sions at the moment , you should look for the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Z@@ FS from Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates that can be treated with record lack on low level and can only hope that it is available soon also for Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
Oracle created an own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ l fil@@ esystem . this is still in an alpha state . this is still using the same protective mechanism which uses the z@@ fs and is also available for &amp; Linux ; however it is not part of the kernel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not under@@ estimate that ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss during the notebook and 46 % in work@@ station systems . at Not@@ ebooks , the share of theft is 50 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
data loss due to viruses is less widespread than most of viruses . it leads to a lower loss rather than any theft or new installations ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been seen before .
open source file systems are less pr@@ one for data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to find the wi@@ ped fil@@ es@@ ystems . here you can find a very good English article here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent cor@@ rupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investig@@ ating process is higher and an un@@ defined status will be avoided before the problem appeared , it is lost . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical limits . this means that while technology is further developed , a natural limit for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s cameras are already high for compact cameras . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result , your limit for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive is responsible today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make any other data loss in every year . secure your data in every year from a data loss . ensure anything more dangerous than the re@@ installation of your operating system , to exchange disks or size changing of hard drives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suppose you take your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive every day . if , then , one day , you will be lucky if the drive wasn &apos;t connected in the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a disaster hits locally and destroys a lot . forget aircraft un@@ fortun@@ ate : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually concern a whole space or the whole house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ vor@@ any means not local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as above already said , a common cause of data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save one day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all the files that are to be secured . it is a snap@@ shot without hist@@ ories and represents a complete copy of a time .
differential backup : backup of the files changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snap@@ shot of two time points : the total assurance and the last differential backup .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files changed since the last backup . it creates the original status at any time again and rest@@ oring a ver@@ sion@@ ing system at the next with the exception it is only cancelled and not continuously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily configure your machines . unlike the script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer files , r@@ sync will only be compressed when you want to enhance safety over ssh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure important images right after you have saved them on your computer , or a different optical medium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this approach can be enough time to discover and re@@ produce losses . at the same time you come to create a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly schedule for at least one month and a snap@@ shot of each month . every additional fertilizer should be done manually after which you have made a complete check .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; themes : metadata , stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC files , volume , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ loc@@ ating images and metadata , copying images , virtualization , visibility , ... , use of the internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that valuable images will survive the next 40 year , that is about the time you &apos;re interested in your childhood or youth , there are two strategies to be considered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the future is un@@ fore@@ se@@ eable by your nature , you need to see everything today with caution . all 5 @-@ 8 years you should have in@@ compatible with caution . if less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this question should actually be answered by declar@@ ations in this document . use or change to open standards , supported by many applications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
virtualization is now available for everyone . if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you modify your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or you want to convert your library and if necessary to convert your library . stay with open standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scal@@ ability is the professional expression to change a system in its size . this means always enlarge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s go out that you have planned and enlarge the scal@@ ability with your dedicated disk or partition . if you want to enlarge it on a dedicated disk or Linux , you can copy this area and store it to a new plate : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the d@@ mes@@ g command , whether your new record has been recognized by the system , but do not depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B / dev / S@@ DC # Source / dev / S@@ DC # Source : the new record is / dev / S@@ DC current / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the disk in MB@@ ER / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of travel FS if necessary
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software can read it , then you can create it yourself . this task is easier for year to year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
GIF is a proprietary and patented format dis@@ appears slowly from the market . they should therefore no longer use it anymore .
P@@ NG has been designed as an Open Source Standard . it can be used for any more . it can be los@@ s@@ less and supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata that it is not so many as TIFF and a slow compression has . P@@ NG is able to recommend you to save your pictures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TIFF is widely stored as image format . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . with some cameras you can edit your images in this format . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
DN@@ G Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a license @-@ free and open @-@ image format that was developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G has already been developed based on the need for use of metadata . a hand@@ ful camera producer is now available to use Canon and Nikon at any time .
this is possibly one of the reasons why the X@@ MP technology has been introduced to replace the &amp; quot ; licens@@ ing Met@@ adata ; licens@@ ing Met@@ adata ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata ; licens@@ ing by operator &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many photographers prefer to archive a original of your recording , mostly in rough format , because it will fit the metadata separately from the image file and the image file will be ignored . therefore , you should think of whether you use DN@@ G as container and place everything there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organisation which focuses on architecture and modelling , community and collabor@@ ative work in the D@@ C@@ MI teams , annual conferences and workshops , standard associations and collabor@@ ative efforts to achieve an extensive acceptance of metadata standards and practices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . so long the pictures on camera work can be used as a temporary backup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
convert blank files to DN@@ G and save them in your body archive . this function is not implemented yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a fin@@ ery processing you can use external programs . when you click the images back with &amp; digi@@ plug , then you should add the metadata again . these were cut off under circumstances of the other programs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protect the processed images for the copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export it into web@@ gal@@ eries , code you in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print , &amp; etc ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ . in the section Add a photos you can already add . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your album bench . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug , connect it to the computer , turn on the camera to the display mode and switch on . another description will be found in the manual of your camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you start the camera interface , you try to connect with your camera . when the connection is made , a finished indicator at the bottom and preview images of all photos can be displayed at the bottom and display the thumb@@ nails for each file , photos , movies , music etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you can download the photos on your machine , you may need to view the camera information about any entry . with the side@@ bars features and metadata you can see the properties of a single entry or its metadata . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this dialog shows file properties and the photo information to be stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the picture has not been downloaded to your computer . note that if some digital cameras do not have any information available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Rider Met@@ adata shows the internal metadata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer effect , GPS etc. of image processing . please note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button to download and then download the photos from your camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ plug . when downloading the photos will be downloaded securely in an album before you delete the photos from your camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos you want to download the desired option of optional options by &amp; K@@ DE ; as soon as you choose the photos selected and then download the selected photos . the button Sel@@ ected Download driver can be selected as long as you have selected some photos .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your camera supports this option , the new pictures have yet been downloaded now . in this case you have downloaded the new pictures with a star in the pad@@ window . if you choose this option only the new pictures are downloaded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use the buttons All download or use the chosen album , the list of the existing albums will be displayed in the section My albums . then select the destination album from the list and press OK . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after taking the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ plug , photos from the camera to the album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you &apos;ve downloaded the desired photos you can delete it from the camera . you can delete all of them at once , so you must select it first and delete the selected photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please note that there are no way photos that you have been deleted from the camera ; so they should be completely deleted , if you want to completely er@@ ase the camera store , as this is much faster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ame for the photos frequently not particularly meaningful name . the fil@@ en@@ ame are usually re@@ iter@@ ated when you upload photos of different recording products into the same album . so it can be useful to integrate the photos of different recording products into the same album . therefore it can be useful to integrate the photos from the camera .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next section , you will find options for turning and mir@@ ro@@ red signatures . if you use this latter option , you will automatically create a folder per day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the options on the transfer opens three additional options to be done before the photos can be saved on the plate . with the last option , you will be able to correct the corresponding items from the EX@@ IF data to IP@@ TC items . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the latest option , you may correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you desire another date format as the standard format you may use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % % % H : % M . turn the option date &amp; time . for further adjustments you should read the help of the command .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use the camera fil@@ en@@ ame option , you have the option to change the fil@@ en@@ ames in lower@@ case . or in upper@@ case , if you prefer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ plug ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name , which will be used to ren@@ ame the camera . your settings will be saved and automatically used when you open the camera window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; digi@@ plug , all information can be used on the orientation of the camera to carry out an automatic rotation during the recording process . in the section of Met@@ adata you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the automatic rotation is normally switched on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t want this information , the photo will be switched off . if you turn off the automatic turn , use the Automatic Rotation in the bottom of the window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when your camera is made available to which the photo was made available to which the photo is made available . all pictures with the same date are shown in the same album . all pictures with the same date are available in the same sub@@ title . in the section side bar met@@ a data you can read what information might have embedded your camera in the photos .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this option is normally Off , and in this case storing &amp; digi@@ plug the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , use the button Create and select date @-@ based sub@@ ver@@ bs at the bottom of the window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the easiest way to download photos from your computer to your camera is the button to download . then select up@@ loading . the file selection dialog &amp; K@@ DE ; appears to be uploaded as well . you can also select more than one file with the Standard &amp; K@@ DE ; methods .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the picture selection is finished , ask &amp; digi@@ plug , you where the images will be loaded too . select the folder selection dialog for your camera . select the folder and press OK to delete the upload . the images will not be deleted from your machine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
GPS ( Global Position@@ ing System ) is used as a general term in this document and can be displayed on a map which can be displayed on a map . the identification of data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian GLO@@ NAS , the europ@@ ean Galil@@ eo or any other system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only for professional photographer it can link to a picture with a precise ge@@ ographic place . not everybody is using an airplane to carto@@ graphical using the GPS data . environment plann@@ ers , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have forgotten your photo , where exactly the photo was taken , you can loc@@ alize the area if you want to loc@@ alize the place of the photos , or simply want document the position data of a photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question is how the GPS data is supported in the image ? first of all , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v2 supports many GPS data fields , such as heading , saddle and map references . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far as we know there is no camera that has integrated a GPS device . but there are a few , which work together with GPS receivers . either as card module or through transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the download of GPS data from one device can be used with g@@ ps@@ man or G@@ PS@@ Babel . however , you must save these dates in the GP@@ X format , as this is the only format supported by the ge@@ ographic classification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data from images and from GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you know the long@@ itude and la@@ titude , or other data , you can use this script using the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey , for example map@@ s.@@ google . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European road cards . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish . all navigation details for Europe show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; digi@@ plug too ; there are many at@@ titudes regarding his work processes as possible . to modify this settings , you need to edit the behaviour of the settings . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the icons of the left . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select action can be displayed on single preview or image processing . so , if you click on an entry in the main view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically logged into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields using the option when downloading from the camera interface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author is a syn@@ onym for authors . this field should be the job title of the photographer . this field should be as a freelance photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer or independent , commercial photographer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
publisher is a syn@@ onym for provider : use this field to enter the photo . this should be listed here if this is a photo agency like e.g. Reuters or Associated theory ; then the group should be registered here if the picture is available here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the IP@@ TC promotions store data into the respective IP@@ TC @-@ ri@@ der@@ s. this ensures that the metadata is constantly available in the picture , and not only available in the database of &amp; digi@@ plug . these metadata is also available and can be imported without lost . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
image descri@@ p@@ tures as embedded letters ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments you can also add to your pictures with the images included in the images . this synchron@@ izes the labels supplied by the &amp; digi@@ plug .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the page Settings contains all the options for the information , which appear when the mouse cursor is displayed in the main window over a file . depending on the selected option this information will appear or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ plug , supports a number of different image formats and some video formats and digital formats . to specify which data types and digi@@ plug too ; Alb@@ um@@ folder , which has no one of these extensions is ignored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can reset the default settings , by pressing the button Update to the right of each category . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings of the lumin@@ ance of &amp; digi@@ plug can be switched on this page . each time you have switched on this page . if you have one click on fast computers , if you have one , then you can get better viewing results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer another color you can switch it off , when you use the tool@@ bar in full screen mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over@@ - and exposed areas of a picture can be marked with dark or bright color in the image . these colours are set here . in the image processing the picture mode can be switched off and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling , the images in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance are coded as in the color formations . please read this article in Wikipedia about the nearby explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with P@@ NG @-@ compression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this surgery is not reducing the image quality , because P@@ NG has an los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value on a high compression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the option TIFF @-@ files you can un@@ load the Def@@ ine @-@ compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it has no effect on the image quality since de@@ sl@@ ate algorithm actively works .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the adjustment of los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files you can drop los@@ s@@ less than the normal JPEG . when this paragraph is not supported , metadata is not yet supported , but was in the planning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ plug , image processing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently it develops quickly to a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog , you can change the image processing settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the default value is that all green pixels are equal to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels with a minimum loss of details . if you use this option , this is a bit soft , elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern using the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this option is set , the white camera is used immediately . otherwise , the automatic colour balance is used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this setting is only used when the white is not set . standard , it is a permanent colour balance , based on a white map which is photographed in sunlight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors this option will get the effect that under@@ estimated images in four steps more details into the top models . for other cameras this option will be ignored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the standard is the top @-@ lights , so the parts of your images will be shown to see the pinn@@ acles of your camera as a continuous white . finally , you can try to recon@@ struct some of the missing information from the nick@@ names . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , you can try to recon@@ struct some of the missing information from the nick@@ names . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is possible because blue pixels in general satis@@ fies itself not so quickly as green and red . &amp; d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to recon@@ struct the missing green@@ - and red percent@@ ages from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question , how many colour or white you want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select the option , select the option to set a level . this is a value of three one compromise and can therefore be individually adapted to each image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to put it slightly higher than the standard 1 , but this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ plug , you should be conservative . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a demo @-@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to obtain a complete picture of the particle data which provides many cameras and that is known as a matrix @-@ color pixels which is also known as CFA @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour construction .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; and D@@ cra@@ w are available to you three alternatives : Bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number from Gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm that used by me . Bil@@ in@@ ear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with acceptable results .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you know the color deviation of your lenses , you can place the red and blue pro@@ o@@ fre@@ ading values here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction correction because you will be performed during the pipe conversion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a profile transl@@ ates the color information and speci@@ fies instructions like this again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ plug ; information such as colour information from a colour gam@@ ut in the others , so that the colours are as accurate as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behaviour questions if a picture is opened in image processing / color management module with blank .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; color profile file Put here the folder , such as / us@@ r / share / color / ICC or / home / .@@ color / ICC , where you can store all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ plug , these folders followed during startup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; settings of ICC profiles , you have the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profile . everything can be changed when opening the blank file later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ro . here only your pictures are not managed on the whole screen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the input profiles should fit you to the camera gate and model you use . not all profiles are listed on the same way . currently , d@@ cra@@ w Gamma is not correct for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you need to carry out the color mapping yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are other options like the Soft Pro@@ of profile , with which you can em@@ ulate , as your printer can have a smaller color range than your camera and some colours therefore can be very satisfied than you can rely on the blind algorithm of your printer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most cameras it &apos;s quite obvious that color profile is fore@@ seen for them . unfortunately , here &apos;s a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is naturally un@@ official : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Canon profile expansion leaves the style of the goal : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for standard style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; K@@ DE ; image plug@@ in interface . it is an interface supported by a series of &amp; K@@ DE ; by delivering of this interface ; many modules are supported to work together with any program running the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your distribution is installed by the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you see a list of available modules . then , these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and additionally you will find some also in the context menu of the preview pane . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brief commands for tasks , which are performed by modules , can be set in the menu under settings short@@ commands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found on the K@@ IP@@ I project using htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ in or in the manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ m settings should be easy to understand . the upper knob adju@@ sts the time between the images , usually are 4 @-@ 5 seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the camera properties shown on the left is a list of all currently supported cameras . on the right side there is a button Automati@@ cally connected to identify the camera . here are serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass memory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the bottom end you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass memory camera . you need to select a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass memory camera from the camera . you must enter your camera here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug , you need to connect the camera to your computer , put it in the display mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try out , whether &amp; digi@@ plug . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after you set up your camera , your camera will appear in the menu camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . in case you have more than one camera , you can insert all of them here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the option of confirmation dialog for the re@@ loc@@ ating &gt; frames in the tra@@ sh bin , you can set the conversation points ; for del@@ eting a photos in one album you will find more details . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editorial section through the right side bar can be used sil@@ ently through &amp; digi@@ plug . if you use the option to use alter@@ ations in the right side bar without promp@@ ting . otherwise you have to save the changes with the button changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also download the display screen of &amp; digi@@ plug ; when starting , this accelerates the starting procedure of &amp; digi@@ plug . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; setting B@@ m Start the new photos to search for new photos ; let the base time deleted by &amp; digi@@ plug . this extends &amp; digi@@ plug , if something comes out of the base folder , ask whether it will delete it from the base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
various colour sch@@ emas can be used in &amp; digi@@ plug ; to adjust the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected under the tool@@ bar settings . preview of the available designs are listed below :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ plug , you will find more information about this tutorial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; digi@@ plug has a quick image processing with some basic tools . you can use this to preview your photos and start correction and improvement . the image processing can be accessed by a click with the left mouse button to preview and selecting the entry / editing .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ . so you are not part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in section Image Processing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a status line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , the file name , magni@@ fying factor , and the current image size indicates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a menu bar at the top edge , including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most common features . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the editing features of the image processing change your photos . however , the original photo will change before you save or save the original photo , once you have saved the original picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you should then add a copy of your image before you change it , so you can do it with Save as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by restore the original image to restore the image processing in the tool@@ bar . you will lose any change that you have done in the photo since the last store . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; virtually any action of image processing can be revers@@ ed or re@@ inst@@ ated . the latest action can be revers@@ ed , converting editing or re@@ inst@@ ated by selecting the Edit menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use this frequently , you should move the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z to und@@ o and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ bre@@ alt @-@ Z to restore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you press the L@@ MB ; over the back @-@ over or restore button in the tool@@ bar , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions are revers@@ ed or restored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you have started working order , you can use the photos in the same album , or use the same keyword in the tool@@ bar , picture above or the entries in the menu , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can enter in the photo , and you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the saf@@ est menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to adjust a photo to the window size you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select a magni@@ fying factor automatically
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; view Full Screen Saver displays the picture in full@@ screen mode . normally , you can use the tool@@ bar button . usually you can call it in the browser dialog of &amp; digi@@ plug . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to print the current image , select the menu item and get the Standard &amp; K@@ DE ; printer dialog . you can customize the settings here before you print your photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of the main menu , you can print individual images or whole sets . you just need to select images with the standard methods and follow the wiz@@ ard . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you just need to make your choice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; digi@@ plug ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides important information and promotions for selected images . the same page bar is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
multiple click on the same rider will appear or disappear once again into the edge .
in the labels view you can enter or insert marking with unlimited size . this means that all special characters are allowed in the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC@@ - fields that you can use other programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the IP@@ TC data support only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are re@@ shaped by 2000 characters , and special characters will be converted into other applications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after inform@@ ing it , use either the button application or simply switch to the next image , the labels will then be saved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the user button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata in the selected file or database . but this will always be done if you have chosen a metadata setting always in the images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evaluation scheme shows an evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting algorithms . it can only be used on a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC @-@ Bo@@ ur@@ gency . encoding follows the scheme in the following table :
the sample view shows a search box for the filters in the keyword and a selection box with the head@@ words previously specified in this &amp; digi@@ plug ; at the session at the session .
the keyword is dynamically adapted to the entered keyword . you can limit the number of possibilities in search of a keyword fast . this ability is especially useful when you have lots of keywords .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the input field at the bottom ends is a further relief when entering the keyword at a picture series . if you have entered various keywords , they are stored for quick access . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; keywords can also be set in the tree by selecting the corresponding check@@ boxes . all keywords of a picture are stored in the keyword box . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if several pictures are chosen in the main view , select a keyword in the keyword tree , if you want to select a selection with a keyword if you have a selection with a keyword please read the keyword : keyword . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the page column keyword is used to change the selection of the displayed images displayed in the main window . usually one or several keyword filters from the right side is used only the cut volume is displayed on the right side . all created samples are available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also draw words and drop your words . if the keyword is already selected , you can easily draw on the right side bar and put it on the selection . then a dialogue that you will ask if you want to put the keyword . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the top example the main window shows the pictures at a calendar day . the keyword is selected on the selection of three images and then a keyword from the right keyword is drawn to the selection and put aside . a dialog will ask if this keyword will be set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this search for changes takes place in each start of the programme , and it can be switched off with settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have a rule with and realized that it is one or its needs , you can easily change it with a double click on the text and in the control range . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 1 ) : the entry to which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , which is already placed in the database . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , you can specify a wide search of all elements of the database with the following options : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to group options , just use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button to take group@@ ing . the options then look as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why not listed Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flickr ? free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the pictures in full resolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this article / Tut@@ orial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly found it on &amp; digi@@ plug , specifically tailored implementation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason why one work@@ places a color@@ less workflow , which can be found by your camera or scanner . with a color@@ fully changing workflow , you can achieve the colors in your camera or scanner that match you or on the web to those from your digital dark@@ rooms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the theme is reflected in colour management , everybody wants to put buttons for the results that he wants to put forward decisions regarding colour management to make your own informed decisions to make you hit the desired results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your picture work@@ flows meets all six criteria listed below , then you do not have to worry about color management . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they work in a monitor calibr@@ ated to the RGB colour space . ( more information please see below )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your only other issues are by e @-@ mail or web , where RGB is the de facto standard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , when RGB works so well and makes life for all so easy , why should you use another colour gam@@ ut and make thoughts about colour bl@@ am@@ aged ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a visual example of the limitation of RGB in comparison to the colours we can see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see the hu@@ gged region and the paint in the RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of RGB with a number of larger colors ( please visit Bruce Lind@@ en@@ oma ) and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working spaces .
do I have to install my monitor when I decided to work only in the RGB color space ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes ! if you do not work in RGB colors or not , you need to install your monitor on RGB mode , then you need to use your monitor on the RGB standard , use a suitable monitor profile or both . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tool produces five automatic correc@@ tions which can improve the image in most cases , before you try to manual processing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the functions norm@@ alize , equal , automatic and contrast of the menu Cor@@ rig@@ inate automatic dra@@ fting will automatically try out your colours the best . you will need to experiment with these effects to see what works best in your photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the whole picture , so the dark@@ est point is black and the brigh@@ test point as bright as possible . this function is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or washed away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; same : this method adju@@ sts the brightness of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity as flat as possible . sometimes it achieved only tra@@ sh . it is a very powerful operation , which causes either wonder at a picture or destroys it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
automatic cut off : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in red , green and blue canal . it determines the dark and bright border @-@ tones and jus@@ tify the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram .
contra@@ sted by contrast : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ ance of the RGB values of a picture by moving the lowest and highest values in between . this is only visible with balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the white stre@@ et@@ off &amp; digi@@ plug , is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform whit@@ eness of a photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the white @-@ off correction is slightly restricted as a colour gam@@ ut with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you are able to run away from the original image if you are working far off the original mode so your chances for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white label with copyright protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ y@@ m . you can launch it via the menu entry paints white edges of image processing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side , both the original image is adapted as well the preview of the tool . if you want to see the original value , then it is enough to click on the window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the preview of the target photos has a red mar@@ ker . the lumin@@ ance of pixel under this mar@@ ker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the right above , a hist@@ ogram will see that once you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful as soon as you see a very small lumin@@ ance . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow of adjustment allows you to improve or download the routing details of your photos .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play with the above controls , you should use the color temperature Pi@@ p@@ ette . click on this button to use select color to calculate the colour temperature of white stock . this button will also set the temperature and green values automatically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , you can set the white button with the list of pre@@ ferences . the following settings are available : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the over@@ exposure @-@ dict@@ ator increases the colors when more than a color channel of the pixel image is shown . this is displayed in preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; save the B@@ utt@@ ons as and loading , exactly this . any setting of the white flag that you may have placed in a text file and later re@@ load . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the button def@@ aults to all filter values back to their default values and the associated neutral white cover . note that also neutral settings will result in your original image . if you save it , your original image will be changed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can adjust the coding depth of the processed image here . 8 @-@ bit encoding is the popular JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit encoding is better for high quality images . this encoding is only needed for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and DN@@ G only . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tool opens the same dialog like editing color images . it uses the change and as@@ cer@@ ation of colour profiles . color mapping can be performed by the sub@@ window for the brightness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another important tool is to be found in the menu under colours sound value adjustment . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several colors at the same time . this is useful when your camera , or your scanner require the same errors , and therefore you will always find the same correction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very powerful way to correct expos@@ ing problems is the tool for gra@@ dation to find that you find under the colors of Gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; digi@@ plug , tool color effects provides you four color effects , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ via filter , a Neon @-@ effect and a can@@ oe filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect of the effect when using a partially developed printing a short flash . the result was a partial neg@@ atively negative image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the intensity controls the Solar@@ isation . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what chem@@ ically possible . ultimately a negative image creates that it is not possible to create a photo paper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the solar factor . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that has been processed ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter sim@@ ulates the so called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a sati@@ ety pad which makes it a stronger contrast effect which makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it emb@@ ell@@ ished many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for one on daylight optimised color film by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and therefore a reference for its smooth picture structure . Vel@@ via offers a very saturated color . the characteristics are also a few pic@@ ograph in which the barely landscapes cut off too much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ne@@ on@@ filter sim@@ ulates Ne@@ on@@ light on the contra@@ sting edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result , and the sli@@ der re@@ ps the thickness of the Ne@@ on@@ lich@@ ts . in large images the filter can overload the CPU for a moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; digital cameras are often having problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual the colour contrast and the lumin@@ osity can be correct in preview . once you are satisfied with the result , use the button O@@ k and you will be applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have a photo of bad lighting conditions , you can reduce the reverse problem : a good choice for satur@@ ation . all changes you can do in preview . if you like this , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between the complex tool Gra@@ dation and simple leu@@ k@@ strength / contrast / Gamma is the tool of sound methods based on the exposure of exposure . even if the dialog is very complicated in this tool , you need the three slide below the hist@@ ogram . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the window contains a graph of the intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active canal and the selected area . under the graph three sliding properties are clicked into the image and the left side represents the dark and right side the bright areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the easiest way to learn to learn it is to move the regulator , and mind how the image changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the right hand , the original and preview of the image can be previ@@ ew@@ ed . the preview will be updated dynamically , based on the settings of the image , the following options are available on the left . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sc@@ aling : using this selection box can be adjusted if the hist@@ ogram is represented using a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic y @-@ axis . in this case the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case the linear organization is useful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three controls : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for middle tones , often known to gam@@ ma@@ values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three shades can be used in the preview of the original image , in order to adjust the levels of shades , medium and light tones . in addition , there is one button for fully automatic adjustment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; returns : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two regulator , e.g. using output values can be used to create a hidden picture as background for something else in the background . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automatically : with this knob , the image values are automatically placed depending on the intensity values of the picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; save as and load : with these buttons , the fil@@ esystem values can be saved and later re@@ loaded . it is used that Gim@@ p levels format is used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you use this mode and the three colors , the input rate is automatically adjusted to all shadows , means and sun@@ shades . select the color view of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the option over@@ exposure @-@ dict@@ ator controls all colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixel and display the combined result of all channels . this means you can see the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect to see in the final result .
below you see an example of the adjustment of the entries applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel and the output rated is unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the left , half of the original and the target image are displayed . the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings . on the right side the following options are available : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
modification channel : this drop @-@ box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beside this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures featuring a digital camera , the linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , if you move a curve part to the right , for example the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones can be correspon@@ d@@ ely connected with the dar@@ ker image pixels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the preview of the original photos , a red mark is shown . if you are going to change this mark to the panel which represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
save as and store : with these buttons you can make exactly this . every curve that you can create can be stored in the file system and later loading it . the file format is the Gim@@ p package format for this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you want to create this method and three colour pi@@ p@@ ettes for all channels of the shadow , medium and solar tones . select the color picture to set control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the option over@@ exposure @-@ dict@@ ator controls all colour channels in order to display over@@ exposed pixel . this means you can see the combined result . this means you can see the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect to see in the final result .
here you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white picture which was corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun notes are applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the channel mixer of &amp; digi@@ plug , image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shade of the photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the channel mixer is another developed tool for mixing the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : you can preview the relative distribution and strike . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed as comparison with the own rider . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preview of the target image has a red mar@@ ker . if you position this in an image , a vertical line in the Hist@@ ogram will display its colour value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the controls for the module are shown in the right below : control for red , green and building allow you to activate these channels . if you are reading the corresponding colors , the channel mixer then is able to reduce your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , especially if you mix Mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise which occurs on the same spot in the color channel , which helps you improve your Mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion into which you can reduce the colour space first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saving as and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any Mixer &apos;s settings can be stored for later , then load it . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the option over@@ exposure @-@ dict@@ ator controls all colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixel and display the combined result of all channels . this means you can see the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect to see in the final result .
here you can see a photo in which the blue channel is re @-@ activated . the option L@@ umin@@ ance is activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography is black / white a work step as colour images can be easily converted on the computer . also with a set of film roller profiles .

green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a green len@@ tic@@ filter . this looks good at all scenes and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . so much like the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange @-@ Filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with an orange l@@ ord@@ ed filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . just like the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Oran@@ ge@@ filter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; red filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white cin@@ ematic diagram with a red fil@@ let filter . this creates dramatic stability effects , and can sim@@ ulate lun@@ ar scenes for day time . therefore , like the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) rotation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
j@@ aun@@ t filters : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow len@@ tic@@ ular filter . this is the natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and with it similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow fil@@ tering .
S@@ epi@@ aton : produces hot light and medium tones while being a bit cold in the sh@@ aw@@ s . this is very similar to the process of a print and re@@ development in a S@@ epi@@ at@@ scho@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and therefore similar to 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) S@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool texture allows you to apply decorative tex@@ tures on a picture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by adding a texture to your picture whether it is a colouring or not , you can look like an oil painting on a canvas , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or as a mur@@ al on a wall . the image processing can be used for this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the semb@@ lance of the depth or the dimensional of the texture on the image .
a paper of textile that has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and that changed in less ( 2 ) and this model has been added to 200 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the &amp; digi@@ plug , the tool frame can add a decorative frame to add a picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to keep the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not a light function . an opportunity to keep its attention is to set the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the stra@@ pping eye . under the frame , the module can be launched from the image processing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
type : with this parameter you put the desired frame type for your image . in detail the picture is wrapped with a large line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) . it ends with a cute three @-@ dimensional setting .
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . value range for the width is from 1 % to 50 % limited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the target image will be larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the aspect ratio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this practical tool , you can insert simple text format@@ ted in a picture at any point . this also works in several places if you need it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type the text one and place it with the mouse . the larger the character set , the larger the character set will be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each setting you have chosen for your text can be changed , until you click the button OK . once the picture is saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool template can apply a template on a template .
the menu image template uses in the image processing can be used to insert templates through a picture .
for sten@@ cil there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation . you need to add the P@@ NG file format and should be made using maximum compression ( 9 ) to add to the size of the template . if you want to add your template in English ; template @-@ list digi@@ plug @-@ U@@ sers @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use this tool for first time , you need to copy your template with the button base folder in dialog box . you can select the folder click here for the next start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the root folder for sten@@ cil has been restored to a tree view that reflect the folder structure of a folder . the selection of a folder will update the template &apos;s template .
under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this knob expands the displayed picture . it is cent@@ ered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smaller : this button is smaller , including the underlying image . if you want to apply the template onto the whole image , you need to minimize the image properly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
move : use this button to move the image below the template . take the picture and put it on the desired position .
use OK when you want to apply the template on your image . the image will then be adjusted automatically .
&amp; digi@@ plug has three different tools for sharp@@ ness available . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sharp@@ ening is a traditional tool for sharp@@ ening . it is very quick and easy , but creates , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sharp@@ ness mask works on the contrast of the edges to be a picture . actually it does not work a bit , it works instead of Gim@@ p and it &apos;s protected by Copyright Chang . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ref@@ ok@@ us@@ shaving is possibly the best of the three ones , because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photos without focus as well as most digi@@ tised images need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this means that there are some sharp edges to a paint dot . the same phenomenon can be observed when colour points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras are usually required more subsequently than normal cameras for the individual user .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in JPEG pictures often a camera has been applied contemp@@ or@@ ously . images in the rough format , however , must always be corro@@ bor@@ ated during processing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some scanners require a sharp@@ ening already during the reading of the image . if you de@@ activate it you will receive control over your image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some situations , you can get useful results by shar@@ pen@@ ed a photo with the sharp@@ ening rating . that can be applied with the menu entry K@@ rig@@ inate sharp@@ ening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you should deal with this however carefully because the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharp@@ ening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too c@@ run@@ chy . the solution to shar@@ pen the image is much easier than to shar@@ pen the image . use the preview window on the right side of the dialog , displays the effect on your photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the filter is un@@ sharp mas@@ ked is a very good tool to remove sli@@ cks from your photos . a demonstration can see here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the original image and the preview can help the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and amount . the default values produce often good results . if you make the def@@ ici@@ er mask strongly , noise and impression of gr@@ ates are creating sharp edges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the radius is like many pixels on each side of an edge affected by the filter . high resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , images should be the best in its final resolution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ per picture which is added to the original . thus , the thickness of the sharp@@ ness is set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sw@@ elling value is a rup@@ ture of the maximum RGB value and the c@@ apped differential amount . this way , areas can define a soft change between the killing of the tones and therefore avoid beauty errors in faces , Himm@@ les and water surface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the un@@ sharp mas@@ king filter . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the processed image the ( 2 ) was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a bit value = 0.@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; digi@@ plug , tool refra@@ c@@ ine uses an image by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted un@@ folding filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this tool seeks a painting by &amp; quot ; re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ing . this is a technique called F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese fil@@ tering . this is a technique called F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese fil@@ tering . the traditional technique for sharp@@ ening images is achieved better than in@@ hot mas@@ king . you can launch it from the menu by calling colors Ref@@ ok@@ u@@ ze .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in practice , the circular folding is much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ altung has a very long tail , depending on the distance results far from the original pixel is influenced by far from the remote pixels . it causes undes@@ irable results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ann@@ ular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of bull@@ se@@ atic F@@ altung . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most pictures you should see a higher value when your image should be very un@@ sharp but should be considered on Christmas notes .
correlation : the correlation can help to reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation is reduced to the sharp@@ ening effect of the module .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking filter : an increase in the smoke filters can help you eliminate art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values are higher than 0,1 . however , the image quality is very poor . a usable value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will still contam@@ inate the image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gau@@ ck &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ck &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases , use this value to zero if you use a value zero , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the smoke filters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix size : this value determines the size of transformation at@@ rix . an increase in the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you choose large values for this parameter . in most cases you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saving as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any refund parameters can be set , thus can be stored for later and can then be charged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
try all tri@@ mming , color and intensity settings based on the image before you use the module .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , you should use the module before changing the image . the reason for this is that a lot of operations make changes not immediately visible , but later we left un@@ comfortable arti@@ facts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you read and comp@@ ress pictures , &amp; play ; than JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generally , un@@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results than hot . this could be caused by in@@ sharp mas@@ king a larger neighborhood than hot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; theore@@ tically , in@@ visi@@ bly mas@@ king has to generate arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never show the effect of the U@@ IR Wiener filters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; practically , the result of the F@@ IR Wiener filters are always just as good as the U@@ IR Wiener filters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; below , you can compare a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused image : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original un@@ sharp colour picture has to be corrected . this image is made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused outcome is in@@ sufficient light for the car focus lens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for more information on the explanation of sharp@@ ening in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at that address . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sli@@ der sli@@ ff sets the rough@@ ness of the area , it was dar@@ ken to create a more natural P@@ up@@ ille . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the color tin@@ c@@ ine provides an adapted color for the pup@@ il . if you like blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust it here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tool image error correction is one of the most widely developed tool to remove un@@ desired arti@@ facts using un@@ parall@@ eled speed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the In@@ tangible algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS lab@@ s in Ca@@ en / France , and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this tool contains various settings as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the tab smooth@@ s and advanced settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; detail@@ ing p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of details . a small value leads to a smooth smo@@ othing over the picture . a value of 0.0@@ 9 should be seen so that no ac@@ count@@ ability should be sub@@ ordin@@ ated always to the direction of direction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; direction @-@ dependent alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ ed evenly to one direction only in one direction . if you have a film pattern or CCD det@@ ries will produce a high value wave pattern . JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts are best eliminated in a value of 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fl@@ atten &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum speed factor above all@@ po@@ . p then define the relative smo@@ othing . therefore apply this value to the degree of noise in your image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; This parameter is affecting larger structures . the higher this value is set . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; repeti@@ tions : returns as often the algorithm and usually reaches 1 or 2 , usually . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
angle Adju@@ st@@ ment da &#91; 5 &#93; 90 &#93; : angular dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is small chosen you should also produce such a long runtime . you should therefore choose this value as greatest possible and acceptable for your needs .
integ@@ rating stri@@ de length &#91; 0,1 to 10 &#93; : integ@@ rating stri@@ de length in pixels . you should avoid the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ness and never exceed 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the More to quality that you receive by selecting this option is only low . it doubles the runtime . we therefore recommend it to leave him out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; buttons save as and loading , exactly this . any setting of image errors can be stored in a text file and later re@@ loaded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; error correction is compar@@ atively very fast during work . however , it can take a long time and get a high CPU load off . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button crash . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
below you can see how image errors have been removed with small arti@@ facts . the module is shown in a photo that is caused by an analog camera . as you see there is a unique piece of film during the trip is@@ del@@ .@@ The original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; digi@@ plug , rob@@ bing reduction is a very powerful tool to limit image noise . it uses an copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tool provides selectable image filters for example , to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts that come from dust or hair on the lens , to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; -@@ effects of c@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you need more information about sensor noise , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the screenshot above shows a typical scene which was made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity , showing a gra@@ dient noise , which can be successfully removed with this tool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following cases , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window settings can remain at the default settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) which is needed for the filter . big values increase the amount of the filter per pixel and can be smooth@@ ed through the picture and the colour in it , adjusted for smaller faul@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the edge of the filter . if the value is higher , the adaptive filter picture details will not adjust . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter picture details can no longer be maintained and smoke or decorate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; edges : controls the edge of edge for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong cannot remove all the noise , or remove h@@ edges , if you want to remove a low noise or JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bulb : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image , we recommend either to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process by the details settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; color : controls the colour toler@@ ances of the image , we recommend either change color or lumin@@ ance to improve the image . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process by the details settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ ating tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance levels of the dar@@ ker areas which are typically more ru@@ de to increase . it does not pol@@ lute the sh@@ ad@@ resses .
d@@ amping : controls the adjustment of the phase edge d@@ amping . this value defines how quickly the adaptive fil@@ tering due to variations of the lumin@@ ance can occur . it can remove h@@ edges and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter on the edges . it can remove noise and is the recommended method for it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; save under and load : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for noise reduction , which you have set , can be stored in the file system and later loaded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the correct cut can be applied to the default settings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes a picture is too cris@@ p for your purpose . fortunately , use the image to shar@@ pen the image and experiment with the smo@@ othing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Photo restoration is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this filter to rest@@ au@@ ration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts , film gran@@ ting , scratches , compres@@ sive images and subsequently receives the content as it also makes human eye . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same algorithm can be used for color and text analysis . the text of the text is developed by another tool that was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ s in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ s . it is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect ; in some areas it generates a few compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ac@@ ts@@ quot ; - small standards that can be found in un@@ compressed image . this setting is intended to correct these problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; buttons save as and loading , exactly this . any setting of photo rest@@ au@@ ration can be stored in a text file and later re@@ loaded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photo rest@@ au@@ ration is compar@@ atively very fast during work . however , it can take a long time and a high CPU load to move forward . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; below you can reduce a photo with tie @-@ shaped noise .. The module is applied to a black and white photo , with a min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film screening on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and that corrected under ( 2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; below you can see another example for the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures were viewed using a scanner which could be applied using a scanner . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; digi@@ plug , tool Hot@@ Pix@@ els allows you to remove Hot@@ Pix@@ els photos which were used with a CCD camera to remove eight . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project , protected by copyright Dick@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bright , tot@@ e or hot pixels are especially a problem when many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ ot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pix@@ el@@ ot ; on a photo with a dark sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel .
load this file in the wiz@@ ard with the button dark . the tool will detect the automatic and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview pane .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important to detect the dark image directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixel by using a CCD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should find the right dark image to correct image . note that the wiz@@ ard will notice the last dark and automatically re@@ charges it again in the next meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image area and preview help you correct the result within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all preview areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select an area around the def@@ icient pixels on the preview and the results of the filter , select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dur@@ ation : an average of the neighbour @-@ pixel is determined . the resulting color will be assigned to all defective pixels in the blo@@ c . for 1 @-@ dimensional Inter@@ pol@@ ation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel block will be drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ d@@ im ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ D@@ im ) and then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
quadra@@ tic : this is the default filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ d@@ im ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ D@@ im ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ D@@ im ) or to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cubic : every pixels with a distance of 3 or less should be drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ d@@ im ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ D@@ im ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the blo@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction for a color photo taken from a defective digital camera with an sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image is increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is under ( 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; digi@@ plug , Vig@@ net@@ fication correction is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net@@ work , or under exposed corners , of a picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wide angle lens , especially those in the medium and large photo format can often smoothly highlight the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ or quot ; ( sh@@ ady ) they can reduce the light using the sensor there . tel@@ e@@ objective show under circumstances also this behaviour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it has also draw@@ backs . many centres filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 at the aper@@ ture filter , which should be able to use the camera with the hand . wide angle lens should also use a hole of f / 16 or smaller then otherwise un@@ conventional effects can be created through motion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the great exposure ranges of today &apos;s filters and colour cameras , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a Cent@@ er@@ filter by using a cent@@ er@@ filter for an image . the algorithm is protected by John Walker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with three shelves , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ point correction filter and with three additional exposure of the target image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of lighting atten@@ uation at the point of the largest density filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which make density to compens@@ ate for a larger degree of v@@ ign@@ ation , reduce it by a small degree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Leu@@ ch@@ starch , contrast and Gamma settings : the editing of a picture with the Vig@@ net@@ correction correction is reducing the lumin@@ osity of the pixels . you will need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options as you only need to increase the settings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to adjust the alignment of the target image , you can zero the values of lumin@@ osity / contrast / Gamma at zero , and use the Gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing from the menu Color Gra@@ dation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the v@@ ector correction for one image . the original image ( 1 ) indicates the exact image ( 1 ) and the correction of a den@@ ial figure and a contra@@ sting correction was also done in the picture with this tool .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; digi@@ plug , lens distor@@ tion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses to photos . it uses an copyright protected algorithm by David Ho@@ d@@ son . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this tool works with geomet@@ ric distor@@ tion . color@@ fully distor@@ tion can &apos;t be corrected using this tool .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coefficient of the second engraving is treating the general geomet@@ rical distor@@ tion of the lens , and can correct the con@@ cave or conve@@ x form of the image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coefficient of the third degree has a similar effect , but fl@@ atter on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coefficient fourth degree corrected the removed facets to the second grass . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ ric distor@@ tion can be eliminated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
general : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion second grave . with negative values can be corrected and positive values ho@@ ver@@ ted distor@@ tion .
corner : this value controls the strength of distor@@ tion fourth density . this value is more powerful on edges than in the middle of the image . for most lenses the &apos; corners parameter is the reverse sign of the parameter General .
zoom : this value will re @-@ re @-@ size the image size and thus creates a correction first gra@@ des . negative values are accelerated while positive the image is smaller .
clear : this value adjusted the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners that increase positive values .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to help you find the best fil@@ tering settings , illustrated the dialog with a preview of distor@@ tion correction . the values you use for your picture are stored and the next start will be used as default values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ton@@ n@@ - or ho@@ ver@@ ular correction should be done before all tri@@ mming and size changes . in case you require a picture to re @-@ cut and then perform a ton@@ al correction would be the effect of the Fal@@ se .
to help you help the best correction of this tool gives you a vertical and a horizontal auxiliary line . move the mouse cursor to fix the dot@@ ted lines in your image and press the left mouse button in order to correct the ton@@ n@@ - / kis@@ sen@@ ic distor@@ tion with the help of the lines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you correct a kis@@ sed distor@@ tion , the resulting image will remove the black edges . you can remove them using the cutting tool in the menu using the zoom regulator or via the zoom regulator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for most pictures the ton@@ al correction consists of . the next logical step for some motifs , such as recordings from front , frames and paintings , it &apos;s the view to correct the camera with the hand you will always have a slight distor@@ tion of perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the ton@@ al correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to sim@@ ulate infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ gur@@ u.@@ org website which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infrared film . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the left hand side of the window , you can select the area for preview . when you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
below the preview you can adjust two parameters of the movie gra@@ zing and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . the ISO regulator changes the amount of the film gra@@ zing and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in conversion . green meadows are white as snow !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the filters contain dyes to re@@ produce inf@@ ra film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply to black / white photos as the color information are missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the infrared fil@@ tr@@ ate applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is placed under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) and the processed image is placed at ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the charts .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter screens is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to re@@ produce film gra@@ zing on your images . this is known by classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films by the manufacturer &apos;s large sil@@ ver@@ - emul@@ sion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the film @-@ gra@@ zing effect gives your photo a certain mood , or seem to move back into the past . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , soft sight especially to your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you must use this filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the regulator , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated for the control of the intensity and gran@@ ularity of grains . if you need more grains if you need more grains , then you can use the filter several times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the film reaction to a black / white picture . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) and the used movie sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; digi@@ plug , filters oil paintings created the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; digi@@ plug , filters oil paintings offer your digital images a nice look like an oil paintings . natural images and still life are good for this effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two controls to influence this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thick brushes are better suited for big images . smo@@ othing , the smo@@ othing or , from the other side look at the hin@@ der@@ ness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the processing volume is marked with the ( 2 ) image size for this 640 pixels high picture is 1 and smo@@ othing 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; digi@@ tisation ; filter coal drawing uses colour and intensity gra@@ dients to create a coal @-@ tas@@ ze . so , pictures of gra@@ dient could change slowly and what scene you would have chosen to sk@@ etch you . this would be good pictures to begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two regulator with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob oses the pin size , and the lower adjust the contrast ( smo@@ othing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the carbon labels . the original picture ( 1 ) and the modified picture ( 2 ) and this changed picture ( 2 ) . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; digi@@ plug , filter engraving is shaped as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses an copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; digi@@ plug , filter engraving is a fast tool to return your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ umental landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the converted picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by distor@@ tion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
shaft block 1 : spl@@ its the image into cells and makes it look as if it is seen through glass blocks .
shaft blocks 2 : analog to the shaft block 1 is distor@@ ted to the image here with another version of g@@ lass@@ blocks .
some effects need a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button .
this filter group allows you to transform a normal photo into an artwork by bl@@ ur@@ l effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; zoom Un@@ shar@@ fe : wi@@ pes the image along the shaped line that turns off from a central point . this sim@@ ulates a visual expression of often seen in sports photography . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
radi@@ al im@@ shar@@ fe : wi@@ pes the image by rotating the pixels around a central point . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a rotating camera .
distances : bl@@ ur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera @-@ eye . the object seems to come back in the background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement of motion : wi@@ pes the image by horizontal movements of pixels . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a linear motion , z : B : from a car or train photo shooting , camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
soft rib@@ bon der@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ pes the image soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or for adding a warm and subtle maneu@@ ver@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sh@@ ot@@ ting shar@@ per : wi@@ pes the image by random displac@@ ement of pixels , thus sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a moving camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
intelligent in@@ shar@@ fe : find the color bas@@ ins in the picture and wi@@ pes this without changing the rest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the photo into rectangular cells , then creates it through the col@@ t with an average pixel value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some effects need a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button .
the shelves are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops on your picture . this gives it natural images a n@@ ag@@ ic appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n by copyright @-@ protected algorithm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the size of the picture , it is often necessary to reduce the size of the drop . number changes the size and density of dro@@ pl@@ ets . fish changes the optical effect of the drops on the image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can keep using the &amp; digi@@ plug , image processing a range free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . if you start the filter application , the area will remain free from ra@@ ind@@ rops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the ra@@ ind@@ rops Fil@@ ters . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset over a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can use it through mirrors or turning into the right direction . you will find the tools in the menu for trans@@ forming or trans@@ forming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo infl@@ ate is definitely one of the most advanced tools in order to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a picture to smaller is simple . the great question is , how can you zoom up or guess the missing information ? how can you see the missing information again ? how can you see the missing information here ? try it and you will see it yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a picture has the wrong size , you can change it on the desired size using the size of the menu and specify the target values . the dialog box is below to see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tool is used to change a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method in order to enlarge the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with better quality , then try the tool to infl@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many image processing programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation like Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . the underlying algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ s in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the tab new size , and are listed below : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; keep aspect ratios : when setting up the new size , the aspect ratio of the original image is retained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; This parameter is affecting larger structures . the higher this value is set . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saving j@@ acks as well as loading will be used exactly , as a text file can be saved and later re@@ loaded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photo infl@@ ate is very fast at what it makes , but it can take very long and a high CPU load to move . you can cancel the calculation at any time with button fastening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; below , you can see an example for photo sho@@ ots by showing a small colouring of the double size . the original ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard magni@@ fication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drawing a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a commonly under@@ estimated tool in order to create a photo , by pressing the mouse button and drag the rect@@ angle , you will see this rect@@ angle then motion while you move the mouse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you leave the mouse button , the area of the photos will be cut off . by doing so you get a good overview as your photo after cutting . a new rect@@ angle can be created by clicking on the left mouse button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The cut button of the image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the file Save or file to save the newly added photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in dialog will remain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the tool According to the aspect ratio , you can indicate the orientation as high @-@ format or landscape format . in portrait format the larger value of the height and in the landscape format is assigned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tool uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always equal , regardless of whether you can use cen@@ tim@@ eters , in@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons to set the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or vertical .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; below dialogue you can use the Max . ratio knob to cut into the maximum possible , depending on the chosen proportion and orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you use the EX@@ IF data format , these settings are displayed as default values on orientation ( horizontal or vertical ) , the EX@@ IF data are reflected in the EX@@ IF data format and not the original image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the help of the help enable you to hide your images better , so that you can put your pictures better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harmonious triangle : harmonic sub@@ divisions are based on the simil@@ arity of the re@@ semb@@ lance . like the third party , harmonic triangles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle in a similar way to the diagonal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
golden mid : the golden middle is a division which is based on several natural growth patterns as the spir@@ als of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the bl@@ ouse leaves of a sun@@ flower . it emerges in all sorts of things we see as beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1.@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was already used with ancient Egyptians and Greeks , making their images , buildings and even photos in order to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 34 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 34 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 34 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 34 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 34 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 34 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 34 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 34 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 34 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 34 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 34 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Golden Center provides liquid aid lines when you put together a picture . these help will count below :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Golden spiral will bring your goal to get good results for your photos . in comparison to third party the golden spiral produces a smooth line of the eyes , and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another rule , the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also referred to the golden spir@@ als . it may be a line to produce the golden spiral ; it can simply be there without the eye , and it will fulfill its task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the golden triangles are also derived from the above @-@ mentioned gold spir@@ als . in contrast to harmonious triangles , golden triangles are not equ@@ atable triangles inside these lines can be placed in a static object dynamic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you use golden triangles to break down your frame , you can use a effect of professional photographer &apos;s dynamic symmet@@ ry . try your image viewer at one of the triangles and other visual information in the triangles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the options Horizont@@ al reflect and vertical mirrors can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines . in case you have a picture of many colors and a high contrast , the auxiliary services can be invisible to the colour of your current image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Free rotation is a tool to turn a picture around any angle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you make a photo , it makes it easy that you turn the camera not exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . you can fix this with the &amp; digi@@ plug , image processing and the tool free rotation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turn your image with the slide angle . the slide values on this slide are measured in degrees . with the button pre@@ ferences , you can reset the slide on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture will be shown on the right side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to help your help , the Free rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line . after you move it over an important point of the picture , you can fix it with a print on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle like in previous section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after you have shot an image you will find undes@@ irable tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to repair it is the function trans@@ forming from image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is automatic shift . select one of the following options :
the option Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing uses the picture a bit after the rotation . note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tively trans@@ formations are performed to adjust the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares to the corners of your image . the preview will then be re @-@ calculated automatically . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which help you to change the perspective :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas produced by transformation , in pixels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new height : indicates the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
angle left at the top : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed object .
angle Right angle : displays the current angle in degrees on the top right corner of the transformed object .
angle left : displays the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed object .
angle Right down : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed object .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after adjusting the perspective , the picture becomes a little bit poll@@ uted . for individual adaptation , this effect is small but two adjustments produce a double the strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after setting up the perspective , you will have unwanted tri@@ angular holes at the corners . a possibility to transfer this is the image with trans@@ forming from the image processing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the shot tool is used to shift one part of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite . with other words , a per@@ verse is transformed into a parallel ogram . you can start this module via trans@@ forming she@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; edit your picture by viewing the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you press on pre@@ adjustments , the angle will be displayed on zero . a preview of the object will be displayed on the right of the preview area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to your help , a vertical and horizontal line ends . move the mouse to fix a wall on your image and press the left mouse button to adjust the lines to adjust your image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you have performed the sh@@ ear , the image is wi@@ ped a bit . for a single sh@@ ear this effect is mostly neg@@ li@@ gible , but two shots are causing twice as much pol@@ arized and therefore you should avoid that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following the sh@@ ear , the image has a beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to remove this is the image with transformer and cut off from image processing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; digi@@ plug , needs a number of libraries and other packages to read and write . the available formats are therefore connected to your system and , in some cases , you will be able to print a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ plug . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system . but you will always find JPEG and TIFF below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; digi@@ plug ; displays only files into formats , and displays only files to the list . if the extension is displayed in the list , you can modify this list of file extensions ; you can modify this list of file extensions ; please find more information in the configuration section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras can even select the format used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ plug . both formats are supported .
image compression is the use of data compression procedures on digital images . redundant information is reduced to save the image data to a more efficient way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general there is better , smo@@ other results than JPEG in the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save los@@ s@@ less when indicated in the settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to learn more about the raw image format that you can find out more about the raw image format in English . you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF . in section configuration you can find further information on the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ plug .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; digi@@ plug ; supports the loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is available in &amp; digi@@ plug . all support cameras can be seen below on the web page from Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats that received from &amp; digi@@ plug . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many digital cameras will support the absorption of short films . these clips are often stored in AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG @-@ format . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ plug ; the &amp; K@@ DE trans@@ forms ; the &amp; K@@ DE key is used to play movies to play the program for playback .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go forward to the previous album in the chron@@ icle , but you can only go forward if you have gone back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syn@@ cing the metadata between the database and all files of the current main window , the images will refresh the metadata of the database and not unlike that menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; menu entry of the K@@ IP@@ I module for manual , automatic twist / reflect the current image using orientation in EX@@ IF information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorted all images in the current album after their names , path , date , file size or their review . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start the metadata of all metadata between the database and all files , so not only those in the current view as with this menu . the other option can be over@@ written from the Menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all configured cameras are listed here . you can use the camera to add a new camera to the list . please look for further information in the camera section .
K@@ IP@@ I module produces a series of images in a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed using Goo@@ gle@@ .com .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do the steps 4 and 5 that you can do good if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four alignment with the Module White . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many tools you need to work in &amp; digi@@ plug . your description will follow here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all image processing tools like sharp@@ ening , soft signs , refra@@ ction , refra@@ ctive mask , which shows the effect in a preview before the filter can be applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture user quot ; in this dialog : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image . on the left of him allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the display area . these modes are :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vertically parts without dup@@ lic@@ ate . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter , applied to the area on the right of the selected area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; horizontal with no dup@@ licate . the upper area shows the original and the lower indicates the filter , applied to the area below the selected area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
vertically divide . the left area shows the original and the right side for comparison the effect of the filter .
split vertically . the upper section shows the original and the lower to the effect of the filter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &apos; Mouse about &apos; Style : shows preview when mouse is not in the preview area , otherwise the original . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that can be switched on to show super@@ - and under@@ exposure . the used colors can be customized in the general setup page .
( 3 ) : the frame to preview the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and click on the part of the image you will see below . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your standard values . all adjusting entries are noted from the last use of the module .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the side bar features show the essential information on the selected image , and is widely explained in the following sections : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters at the shooting of the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data if they are available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this rider sits an intuitive map tool based on the mar@@ ble @-@ thumb@@ nail , or copy it by using the mouse wheel or move it . all images inside the coordinates must be filtered and displayed . this is of course pres@@ umed your pictures encoder data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; cau@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is a editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and to choose and nam@@ ing colors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pall@@ ets files that are installed by &amp; K@@ DE ; can be installed either for the whole system or just one user . in the latter case , they are used in your personal folder for &amp; K@@ DE ; settings and hot user defined paint and last used colors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the dialog box , you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or browse the folder to files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cursor is displayed as a line in the pallet view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it shows onto the colour beside it . color is described under the pallet view . here , the color name can also be changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can also be used to choose from . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor there . then move the mouse on pressed lin@@ ker mouse button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the check box by the cursor is inserted below the cursor to the cursor is inserted . the colour is selected either inserted or over@@ rides a different ; depending on whether the mode is selected or selected by selecting the check@@ box below Bei@@ m cursor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a selection , which is generated as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions of copying , cutting and past@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; col@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; used the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color follows three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name . in case there are three numbers in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit .
the colors in the palette and the output selection can be pulled with the mouse .
choose a color somewhere on the screen and then select it in the color selection on the left .
&amp; T@@ graph@@ s ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ Graph@@ s ; These programs are based in science ; in particular in computer science ; these programs are based on the program vend@@ or &amp; X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programs with just a few functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; project has set itself to the goal of replacing these programs by a modern , user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all features of a well integrated &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing from &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ Graph@@ ene ; Graph@@ ene with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; K@@ DE ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph in &amp; Kate ; graph@@ s new calcul@@ ates and in &amp; graph@@ s ; represents )
menu to open the graph@@ s in &amp; Kate ; opening or graph@@ s in &amp; graph@@ s ; in a &amp; Kate ; component to open
load from large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems with approx . 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to present more than those knots )
other required software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; program that pre@@ suppos@@ es the &amp; graph@@ ic@@ us ; -@@ Tool &amp; dot ; for the presentation of the graph . needs :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main window displays the opened graph@@ s , each in its own sub@@ window . at first , the tool@@ bar contains only the icon below . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the icon below . click the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after you have one or more dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the lower screen picture :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed when the graph is larger than the character area . you can select a fixed position of this overview , or choose this position automatically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special buttons , left and right for pressed &amp; old ; -@@ key ) ;
zoom is restricted in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum processing of a graph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the straight into &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; loaded file changed from another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can choose if the graph is re@@ loaded or if you want to change your decision , so later , you can change your decision later , you can set up your decision later , see ... see also . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you can open a graph outside of running &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; -@@ instance , you &apos;ll have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; -@@ instance if you want to display a new &amp; k@@ graphic display . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when starting the program startup , you can open all graph@@ s of your last meeting again . again you can change your choice as well as change later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also specify how the graph should be divided into several pages , the number of horizontal and vertical sites can be chosen freely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you use multiple pages , you can select whether the parts of the graph are to be ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the sides are not filled with the respective parts of the graph . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
side preview with one on several sides distributed graph@@ s without head@@ line and with another font
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the page Er@@ ne@@ ut store opens the way to specify the behavior when a file on the hard disk has been changed , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can download a default behaviour ( automatically re@@ charge or cancel the program ) or the program each time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the page open gives the way to specify the behavior of &amp; graph@@ s ; specify when a graph can be opened without any current session ( in a new window or in a window of the already running session ) or determine that each time you are asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the site administration site gives the opportunity to specify the start behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; you can open a default behaviour ( which can open or not ) , or specify a default behaviour during each start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the context menu , which usually appears in a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; appears , offers additional options : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Lay@@ out@@ algorithms . the entries as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the algorithm uses the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) , and then trying to produce as short edges as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ shaped graph@@ s . it produces illustrations in accordance with the spr@@ ing@@ unit model . thereby the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wai @-@ algorithm uses the same volume with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm generates a spr@@ ing- model model layout . it uses the Fru@@ it@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold he@@ uris@@ tic and includes a multi @-@ grid for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; cir@@ co ; algorithm re@@ arrange the no@@ des , according to the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of several cyc@@ lical structures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens a dialog where you can specify a Lay@@ out@@ command , which will then take the graph to st@@ d@@ out in the x@@ od@@ ot@@ us format . with such an layout mode , you can give specific options , or modify the graph@@ s with a filter before being drawn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
define the type of graph@@ s ( directed or executed ) and apply the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for sh@@ ined , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for geri@@ atic graph ) .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Flickr is an online photo database on the Internet . with Flickr is possible to let people coming to humans , which are important to photos your favorite photos and show your photos safe and secure your friends and family around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the module exports to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to an Flickr server on the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use the module for the first time you are done through the process of generating a token . this is used quasi as your authentication . a browser is launched , so you can register with Flickr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the successful registration , the module can send photos to the Flickr website . you will be presenting the following page according to a successful login . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just close the browser window and return to the program . after you have pressed on Yes you will get the dialog to upload photos by Flickr . this will be shown in the next section .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the module is launched to Flickr for the second time , you will also be able to use the following dialog boxes . the module currently supports no other per@@ missions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the button Add you should be pushed once once you have placed all the other options . with this button you can click on the O@@ k button . if you press on the O@@ k button the upload of the photos to Flickr server .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the keywords can be filled with words separated by comm@@ a , which will be added to the image as keywords . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the options Public , friends and fam@@ illi@@ e you can set the per@@ missions to your pictures . by default the photos are classified as private . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the maximum size can be used to determine the maximum height of the images . the size is so changed that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module gallery Export is a tool to export your images collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Gallery export is currently not a documentary . in case you are interested in writing these are interested please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I teams under K@@ DE @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of a picture , and the geographical data will be stored in the EX@@ IF keyword which can be displayed in a map in an external browser . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization is available to loc@@ alize pictures geograph@@ ically in spher@@ ical coordin@@ ate system , which is used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , long@@ standing and la@@ titude . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to cor@@ relate your pictures with ge@@ ographic data , you need a GPS track in the GP@@ X format . G@@ PS@@ Babel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data to you from your GPS device . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
image Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alization Cor@@ rec@@ ator . this interface can result in a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the images that cor@@ relate to the main window and call up the menu . in order to load a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you will need to upload a file with GP@@ X file to the same places as the pictures of your camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the file is loaded an automatic correlation , which shows the coordinates in red . GPS track data are converted into GMT using GMT . this can be performed using the GMT mechanism . this can be done with the time zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the deviation for the maximum time vari@@ ance gives a higher deviation between the GPS time and camera wisdom . , there is the deviation of the dates below , the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have no track data from one place for pictures , you can manually edit the GP@@ X file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate all images in this area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you do not know suitable data , if you know that in reality you can place a location in a great time difference between camera and GPS , and then push the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coordinates can be manually set up with this dialog . this is useful when you notice a number of photos at the same location . since the dialog will use the coordinates from a call to the next , you just need to use the button to put the data in the current photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the location can also be found with the displayed map and it can be found . so , select the appropriate region and increase it again . the card can always be selected manually . the card can be changed manually between card mode , satellite photo and a mixed mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to hang up the GPS data to the images . here is a small script used to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I Module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums than HTML pages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this module can export your albums in a gallery of HTML pages to version 4.0@@ 1 . you can select the albums , and specify the parameters for HTML pages . the character set is encoded as UTF @-@ 8 , to provide the best possible internation@@ alization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the module has four horse@@ men in which the settings can be customized to select all albums , and you will need to select all the albums . with the three buttons on the right side you can easily select a large number of albums . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the three buttons on the right , you will need to display a large number of albums . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tab appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is widely explained in the image . if you click on a picture , the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your favorite images . choose a folder on which you write to write . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you select the JPEG file format the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with other colour depth you can change the default color depth , which naturally also affects the file size . all other settings are explan@@ atory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rider thumb@@ nails allows you to customize some of the settings from the Album tab for preview images , which are small pictures to be displayed in the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an progress window displays the user as far the action is . press qu@@ itting to break the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the module created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore preview the program reports to preview the preview of the gallery . press Close to close the module . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL based tool to watch images .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to watch a selection of images and operate on them base operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or blocking . it was designed for quick viewing and quick access to its functions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the start a picture is shown in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this module allows the promotions to save images in JPEG format , without the usual losses of quality and metadata . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size is increased , as no compression of the colour information takes place . this is also possible for the P@@ NG format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera clip is a tool that you can connect your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera counter has no documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I teams under K@@ DE @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. email : the participants of this list speak English . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Met@@ adata editor has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact Mail@@ ing list K@@ DE @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the import function of the metadata model you can copy data from one image to another . then , select the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the desired image . the data will be copied after clicking on the button OK . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any target format . JPEG is supported by writing . please check out Ex@@ i@@ v2 , in order to see what formats are supported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Code module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slideshow .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG @-@ video using a defined length . this module uses the packages of M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ mag@@ ick . you can also add a audio file to the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slides .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition to this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XV@@ CD / SV@@ CD / VCD file for your DVD player . finally you can use the K@@ 3@@ b program to burn the medium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first you need to select the images that are packed into MPEG Di@@ vers . after that , you can start the module via Extras MPEG slide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the images selected from you are then listed below image files in the portfolio , where you can also change sorting of the images or contents of the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you are happy with your list , you should select the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , XV@@ CD , SV@@ CD and NTSC . PAL is pre@@ set and is most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next step , you should indicate the time in seconds which will indicate the speed of the images below . a low value creates very sudden , very smooth image @-@ change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave them black . the name and the path of the created file , you can define as the extension mp@@ g as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you specify a audio file under the name of the audio source file , you can easily drink the production of the movie . depending on the speed of your computer you can now drink a coffee or enjoy the slides when you are back again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a note appears that coding or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ mag@@ ick packages on the right below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the print assistant allows to print several images on a sheet of paper , together in standard phot@@ og@@ lass . this is e.g. useful to print , or print it with Gim@@ p module to direct expression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import and convert your data stored in the RA@@ W format in one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w from Dave Coff@@ in . it does not expect the same results as the software from your camera owner . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first you choose to convert the RA@@ W file , then start the module . the Ra@@ w image converter window appears in mode for a single picture . with the button preview , you can view the effect of your current settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides how g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can later edit the image later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected , so that you can use contrast information . in case your camera works in RGB mode the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can select one of the three output formats and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tagged image format , TIFF , reserves all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are planning to process your images frequently or you later use the JPEG format , because there is only a limited number of operations before the image quality is wor@@ sen@@ ed . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case you select JPEG as a memory format , the metadata that are contained in the RA@@ W file are stored in the JPEG file in EX@@ IF information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the batch editing mode allows you to convert various images at one time . therefore , use this mode when you are safe , e.g. by testing on a single picture , which are the best settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , this is useful to over@@ write existing file . this is useful when these progress made in an earlier attempt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the progress bar shows how far the conversion has advanced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in one album . the program convert the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ mag@@ ick Package . the following image formats are supported :

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ NG format file format is not very suitable to minimize the size of photo files , but it &apos;s best to use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend you to JPEG format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select JPEG pictures below , select the original files in the JPEG format , then the original Ex@@ i@@ f@@ data will be added to the pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fil@@ en@@ ame option provides , that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images in the lower left corner will be displayed during the presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a loop loop . after that you can manually start eating with Es@@ c ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the option images randomly select that the pictures are displayed in random order , so it does not use the sequence of images in the album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under lag between images , the time distance between the images can be set between 1.5 seconds and is a good default value . the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are more than a dozen trans@@ ference effects between which you can choose . randomly cho@@ oses a different effect when switching between images .

the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the desktop surface .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu as background for your K@@ DE work surface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you press the mouse to the associated entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select another person only the pictures are displayed , on which both persons are shown . by this selection procedure , you can limit the number of displayed images to a few thousand images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have selected all the persons , locations and other settings , you can view photos with preview images to view images of your activity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the picture every person has the same symbol in front of its name . you can store with &amp; photo album , but for each person you can have their own thumb@@ nail , this also applies to locations , keywords and other categories that you own . see the image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to view images next to the names , select the button to view your category separately ( if you can view images with images of persons and at the same time ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to enter a sequence in the text font or description , you may also enter a date which will be searched for , e.g. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all images for certain names as you can see in the picture . here , the pictures are shown by Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the user guide book for &amp; photo album , if you don &apos;t like to read manu@@ als but rather try to try out features , have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , and take a look at the quick exit , screen shots and the introduc@@ tory videos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &amp; photo album , and select the demo album , if you start &amp; photo album ; for the first time , or select a few example images and you can try the functions of &amp; photo album ; try . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the website of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a related HTML document to download . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the time bar . a picture of this bar you see here : as the name says it shows date statistics on the pictures in your database .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the time line can display several different time units . each bar shows a different unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database , showing only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the time bar can be inter@@ actively used on the following ways : you can select the displayed output view from the database ( if you indicate a date , the time line will always display the current date of current displayed images when you view in preview view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also select a range of the time bar , drag the mouse button and drag the time information about the ruler of the time line . you can cancel the selection only pictures of this period , by clicking on a bar of the time bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; K@@ hot@@ album ; introduce two ways to create HTML web pages with your images . the one is integrated in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version is described in the following part of the user name . create an integrated version that you can use in the HTML ... file .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before HTML pages are created , you need to make some settings . these are divided into three areas content , layout and target . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , enter the title of the review and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on photo album ; HTML example pages , see an example for this settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next , select whether a &amp; photo album ; -@@ export file will be created to see the export page displayed on the review page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , you can choose which information is displayed on the HTML pages . so you can &apos;t download all images displayed by a party . for example , you may not use all images from one party . so you can &apos;t use all images to hide certain pictures before particular viewer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this section , you can determine how the HTML pages should look like . most import@@ ation options are clear , which is why it is not specifically cited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . this will have the need to download and monitor a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the viewer can change the resolution at any time at any time . so , it can result in your pictures with low resolution which results in a lower transmission time . if he wants to get a picture larger , it changes to higher resolution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this setting , place the various folders and URL where your website is stored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; best for all your HTML files , choose a base folder and a new sub@@ folder for any of your HTML files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first you have to select the main folder , where all your pictures are saved . this folder will be saved and then select the location for all future pictures . here you can choose to select a folder or a K@@ DE protocol , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you have created your images , you can verify if you have created a URL to your computer . if you have created a URL for the Base folder , you can set the URL here . otherwise the web browser should start in the wrong folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the HTML files created by you do not have to enter it manually . so , you will need to enter the final target of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder inside which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the just setup options all refer to base folders or URLs . in this , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you define in output folders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are looking forward to a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or anywhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you may have to add a HTML page to view images , reception location , etc . , you do not need to make this work even more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &amp; photo album , you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import and import them into your database . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in the file , or if you have all images added to the file . the obvious dis@@ advantage is however the file size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the menu Export ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file , you will create an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a external .@@ k@@ im file searches the pictures in two ways . at first , the images of the URL where you can find in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file , the images of the URL where you can create your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML Export . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following , the dialog for exp@@ orting images is described by the Export menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main option of this dialog is whether it is intended to take internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three selection options are available to you :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when using Manu@@ ally , you will need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using Automati@@ cally , copy the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; copy the images automatically for you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; .@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most pictures already been compressed with JPEG . if you do not want to comp@@ ress the files , just select the export file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last option of this page is maximum image size limit . if you send your friends pictures , you might want to limit the size you might say , for example , that each image should be maximum 800 pixels high and broad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you import a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the Menu Import menu , the exported database will import as described in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the assistant to import consists of four steps . first you need to select which pictures you want to import , in which folder which import images to be copied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it can be that you are person@@ alised in the category individuals of the imported file ( if you are a da@@ ys@@ .@@ This is why you are to be imported to the file in the third dialog window and which categories of which to be imported into your database .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the current database with the categories of your current database . one example above , see the image here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must be easy to search and view images : if you look at images , you will often like to see images from your Italy holiday and see a picture with your boyfriend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this manual , you will run the various steps from ( 1 ) to pass the information about your images , via ( 2 ) that pass through and pass until ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was started as a program to manage your pictures . however , it was aug@@ mented and today also takes care of pictures . at many places in this manual it will be done about images , but also happ@@ ier videos with one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; photo album ; stores all his information in the file index@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of your pictures . this is a simple XML file , which you can copy to a disk or re@@ visions in CVS , where you want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ illers album ; check the folder where your pictures are saved and use this in future Star@@ ts . if you want to start another folder in &amp; photo album ; use the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / index / inde@@ .x@@ ml .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; via the menu entry and photo album , up to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; photo album , you will be explained in the following section of the user name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the left you can see six different symbols , which allows you to preview and the options for the viewer , which you can retrieve a detailed help by pressing a button on the F1 key and click on the desired option . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has been described to you as you can set different properties for each image , for example , persons , locations and tags . you can also create your own groups such as items , animals or albums . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to view the dialog , which is used to edit already existing groups . for each existing group you can select a label and a icon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the section sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialog box , you can set up complete members of membership , e.g. all members of a group in a group rather than all groups of a middle class as explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the selection options available , you can select the category options available to you . with the listed selection list you can select a list with the current category and in the right list of sub@@ categories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; photo album , divi@@ ding his modular system with other graphics applications , like digi@@ p@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is named K@@ IP@@ I and K@@ DE ; image plug@@ in Interface . click on the homepage of Ki@@ pi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the modules can be called through the Module modules . however , they are not described in this hand@@ book ; but most modules have a help page that you can call on the modules itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the modules of several applications can be used together to each other , you can test the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; demo database only with the command &gt; k@@ screen album -@@ demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or not , I wouldn &apos;t have warned you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , which means that some modules with &amp; buying album ; do not work . this is the dis@@ advantage if you share functions with different applications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; label the biggest difference between &amp; photo album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , this kind of order is not sim@@ ulated , sim@@ ulates them for some modules the order for albums , so you can use the following functions with &amp; photo album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current album is sim@@ ulated &amp; photo album , which corresponds to the current view , so all pictures that show you the picture preview at the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next to the current album you need &amp; include a photo album ; the modules also have a list of albums . here you go &amp; photo album ; as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when &amp; photo album , s browsers show the content of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry represents an album for the module . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or it will be the category that you have defined in the setting dialog as a category for virtual albums , for example , if you have selected individuals to view it and share this module . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since some modules with &amp; photo album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . then start the setup dialog and select the module , which modules will be charged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the picture you can see an example for a home screen , as soon as you start &amp; photo album ; start your own images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see the window with which you have entered your image database . at the moment we will show you no information about your pictures , now click on the images below that shows you an overview with all existing pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the main functions of &amp; co@@ co @-@ album ; is the possibility to view each picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons that have been recorded in the picture or for example on all pictures Jes@@ per is shown and all pictures in Copenhagen have been recorded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all these notes can be used for searching and brow@@ sing as you can read in the section , if you want to see these notes when you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case you can see three lists with a text box by setting people , places and keyword . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , since you will always be able to use information about your pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following idea lies the shifting of the images within the list : if you are shown for example a family party and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons can be moved , so you can find the specific names possible to find and assign them faster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sorting by date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have selected notes for each picture individually , you may need to edit all selected images and click these pictures with ann@@ ot@@ ations . click in this case just before and back buttons , which are under the preview of the picture on the right top . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . besides , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as an over@@ group . to show you that it acts around a group , a special symbol is displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of context dialog@@ s you can add an entry to an existing or new category . additionally , you may also add an entry onto a category . please note that you just sort your categories alphabe@@ tically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move the individual elements of the field dialog , by selecting the glue , which forms the outer edge of the frame , and move and move from within a frame by going out of the window zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have adapted the size of the window to your needs , click on the button options to save the current structure and appearance of the window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also make a frame fully f@@ ading out . if you want to see this window later again , use the button options ... and then select a window . this process can be seen in the picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select the index pictures in your browser , you will find an overview of preview images of the currently selected pictures , or any pictures if you don &apos;t have any filters you can configure the size of the mouse with the middle buttons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is furnished as background image for your desktop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you click on a picture , this image viewer will appear . if you don &apos;t have a window with a picture viewer , a new ad window will be created . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the picture preview , you can delete pictures from the image preview or delete the image file or select in the menu Edit menu . now the window will appear you can see in the picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ illers album ; for this problem you can have a solution to you . you can also use the pictures stored on the hard disk if you have to be saved onto the disk index . in the picture you will need to view the pictures of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from disk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures , where the upper right corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . however , the preview images are displayed at the pictures 1 @-@ 9 , so you can view these images not with the image viewer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you see , this feature does not require you to copy files from the folders and avoid it in order to avoid any of your images back in order to store all images back to your pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the menu images you will need a sub@@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to remain un@@ accessible by the bottom of the menu , you may also filter all the pictures you can see your little sister , you &apos;ll want to unlock all your little sister , to unlock everything except the current view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , you have set out what pictures are hidden in the case of your little sister , which allows you to delete the pictures you &apos;ve closed , click on lock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also possible to specify a password , which must be entered to unlock the images . simply change your password in the Privacy menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please remember to read or delete all images on the hard disk , and anyone can read or delete all the images on the hard disk or any other that can be found on the file index@@ .x@@ ml ; not very familiar with regard to private images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason why you manage all your pictures with &amp; photo album ; manage and write about hours with this , of course you want to be viewing . for this reason you have one photo _ and video viewer . you can preview this from the preview , as described . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the viewer can see you in . it shows the image , but additional all the information you can set on the image , for example who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the Info@@ Box is at the top part of the picture you will want to see and somewhere else . you can also configure which information will be displayed and if all these options are displayed on the viewer right @-@ click on the viewer . all these options can be viewed below .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click here , the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you &apos;ve selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene could have chosen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have several images on the viewer , you can switch between them and jump back . you can access the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these features can also be accessed from the context menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if several pictures are loaded in the viewer , you can start this as a slide . then download a new picture by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l button and plus or minus . then the slide show is stopped by the keys C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful skill of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it possible to change the full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the whole space on the screen . simply use the input button to change full@@ screen mode and back .
if you use the viewer you can insert a rect@@ angle using the mouse . you can zoom up the plus @-@ key in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom rect@@ angle is marked again and shows the end result of ZO@@ O@@ MS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the dot key , you can reset your zoom so that the image will not be zo@@ omed . with the equ@@ alizer , the ZO@@ O@@ MS stands that every pixel image is based on a pixel image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations that work with videos , that &apos;s in and out with the Plus@@ - and Min@@ u@@ sta@@ ste . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the functions from the Con@@ text menu , you can turn the image . this does not work with videos . you can make any comments on the current image with the menu item from the context menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you can see images that you can see a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten to insert this name . at the moment , you can open the image and see how to highlight the picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer , to see the photos on paper and mark it as good or bad , while you can see one after the other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the two examples above , the viewer allows you to view images with features while you view them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can put a feature to press the corresponding letter . in which features A , B and C are set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you have set features on your images , you can see them in your browser . so you can use all the pictures you want to print , print or whatever you want , in order to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; categories and special features can be displayed in preview view . if you view categories in D@@ re preview , then you can simply press the characters for the feature , after the picture has been selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case , you will be allowed to paint &amp; photo album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the painted will not be saved with the image , but in the database . on the way you can und@@ o your vegetables later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to draw a picture on the painted page . to turn on the painting from the context menu , simply select the cross in the tool@@ bar on top of the window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you must not fully control the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; but documentation about &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the object tree you can select single objects . then their properties are displayed in the object characteristics and displayed in the object in the wire models .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , since all accommodation objects are already selected with the object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to insert a new object in the object tree , select the location to which you insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are possible positions , the next fold @-@ down menu will allow you to choose the correct position : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with del@@ etion either from the menu bar under edit or from the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have changed properties , click Apply to Apply this changes . if you entered invalid values , you can report invalid values and click on instructions or to cancel changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you enter the Path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution so you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you edit a texture or a part of texture , you can see a preview in the Met@@ adata page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
press preview in the Met@@ adata page and a small example of the scene will be interpreted using the chosen texture . as the default is selected as a texture within a texture map and not the full texture map ) .
the screenshot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these check@@ points with the mouse button and thus change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a transformation is chosen , the control points and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts within the whole window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each object has as a wire model a V@@ isi@@ bility level or as absolute value . objects are displayed only then , if they are selected or their visibility is smaller or equal to the tool@@ bar defined in the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window order as default . the object tree and the view of the object features are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window rules or if you need a different arrangement , you can also save multiple window orders and easily change between different directions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to anch@@ oring a window above or underneath a view , drag the pine@@ apple to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle indicates the new position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create a new column , drag the pine@@ apple to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then ancho@@ red at the right or left side of this view and extends beyond the entire height . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to arrange more views in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card reader on the top in the views .
the last possible window rules are floating views : views that are not ancho@@ red in the main window . to view a view from the anch@@ or@@ age or click on the little arrow pointing at the left @-@ pointing arrow in the An@@ f@@ asser@@ strip .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to view a view , click on the small cross in the An@@ f@@ asser@@ t . to stop closing , click the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu you can find items for any type of views . new views are narrow , you can anchor on any spot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current window view can save you with view window order ... to save . it will display a dialog where you can save the window rules below an existing or new name .
when you created a scene you can ren@@ ame them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be installed properly . this version is currently not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 not supported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ren@@ ounce the current scene , click the Ren@@ ame icon in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry view scene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a R@@ ender mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; he determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to insert a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can create any number of R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview of up to full @-@ quality images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you click on the R@@ ender button in the tool@@ bar or the View menu View menu View menu , the following dialog will be opened : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each R@@ ender Mode has a name . you can enter any desired name , but it is a name to recognize the properties of the mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the card size , you can enter the width and height of the apped image . if you want to ren@@ ame the cross section and enter the image section to the rendering in the input fields . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in combination @-@ down quality you can select the properties that uses &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user refle@@ ctions . a detailed description of the R@@ ender features can be found in the user &apos;s guide to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a picture is rendered with only one ray per pixel , there are often a variation of fashion effects in curves and lines , in addition , details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixels . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing , to reduce the influence of this error . generally , pictures with this feature are better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you add anti @-@ ali@@ asing , comp@@ utes and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard , an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive , because every pixel is again divided and adapted because every pixel depends on calculated colour values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray is using a ray per pixel . if you calculate the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be charged at a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the difference between two pixels will be comp@@ uted : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixels , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixels . the difference is then : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + ab ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + ab ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recur@@ sive method will start with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the colour values are divided , the pixels will be pursued separately and can be evaluated on further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of records can be adjusted with depth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the production of noise for the ray process , called j@@ itter@@ ing , changes &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays to avoid a tiny amount to prevent regular patterns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the final setting for the quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this feature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this map , you can adjust if the alpha channels are calculated by using POV @-@ Ray . a pixels is then transparent if the associated beams have no object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene file to import , select the menu entry file ... and select a file in the dialog window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; yet not the full range of commands of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; when import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings may appear , a dialog box shows a list of messages .
if you don &apos;t support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds to the source code of the object into the open text file into the editor and drag him into the object tree .
with copying and past@@ ing in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ;
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is P@@ ov@@ ray or x @-@ P@@ ov@@ ray .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you click on the Help View , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er , the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation on the displayed object . here the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 will be supported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you insert files to the folder , you need to enter the path to those files here , the first found file will be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the view in the camera view and in the windows type license .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can set the score of the points on the grid in the context menu of the wire model . here you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bigger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore require more time for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects , e.g. the ball you can set the detailed level for two directions separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you cross High detailed projection screen for advanced projec@@ tions , all projec@@ tions are used with advanced projec@@ tions . advanced projec@@ tions are a better approach for projec@@ tions , requiring more time to rendering . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you tick the wall , a wall is framed behind the objects . the wall is shown in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you tick the bottom , a bottom is framed below the objects . the floor is displayed in a check@@ er@@ board pattern of two adjustable colours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you tick the tick check , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering of scenes . the values for depth and sw@@ elling can be set . in section of the parameters you can find in section of R@@ ender @-@ modes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the section window orders it is explained how you can create and save window orders .
the combination field standard window rules : displays all existing window frames . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window rules when starting the program .
the list of existing window orders displays all existing window orders . a new arrangement can be added using the button and er@@ ase a selected layout with the button .
each window order is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list below shows all views of the selected window rules . new views , you can add the button Add and delete selected views with the button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new column lets you create a new column on the right @-@ hand side of the existing window , using Un@@ ten and the view is not ancho@@ red in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so you just have &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to create without more accurate knowledge of the two programs . if you can follow all the steps in this tutorial you should be very popular among beginners : a bul@@ let on one level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but you should consider the following war@@ nings , before you make compl@@ aining that you can only use a black screen . if you use a 3D programme for first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you set no camera , no rules for rendering can be applied as a result you receive a black image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not insert a light source , your whole scene is in the dark and you will get only a black picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have installed everything fla@@ w@@ lessly installed you see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following default window rules :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation , so that you can get an appropriate performance of what you can expect from this program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols often , so you should mem@@ ori@@ ze the menus and symbols and their applications as well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to remove this guide you first have to remove all objects from the object tree . select the menu item to delete . thus you have a scene without objects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the camera vision shows how the camera shows the whole scene you produce . in particular , this is the view from the scene from the point of view . this shows you the result of the scene from the scene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . when they click on it . in the user documentation about &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray you will find further details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not change anything about the basic settings of the camera , but note that the camera in view control points has to change with which you can change the camera from the mouse on a control point and drag it to the desired place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you press the button application or the input button , change the wire views and the object tree immediately in accordance with these settings . as a result they see the scene from the perspective of camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many possibilities to create the ground for the scene . they could insert for example a qu@@ ader ( In@@ sert endless body Qu@@ ader ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 but this is a comprehen@@ sible method for solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler option . you can use an infinite level as a floor :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good advice : select the plain in the object tree , change the name and press the button application or the input button . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the wire drawing view now indicates the plain , even in the moment only as a limited plane . when you ren@@ ame the scene , the level extends to the horizon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you view the object tree on the object , you will find the default options for each new object . in this case you will find the default options for each new object : scale , turn and shift . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the object description . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this scene , you should move the soil to exercise a unity under the horizontal line , so select some of these parameters . select shift and set the values as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choose only the soil to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but select something from the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in both cases a dialog will open in which you can choose how to change the object . please select your name in the object tree ( name = bottom @-@ pig@@ ment ) with a click on the button preview please see how the pig@@ ment looks like now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the preview of Pig@@ ment is showing only a matte black material , because you need to check the pig@@ ment for the pig@@ ment . do you now give the colors for the pig@@ ment . but there are many options now , but take the easiest way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you don &apos;t see color on the qu@@ ader and ball in the preview , click on the Apply button and then call the preview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the material for the floor is now correct . if you ren@@ ame your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course this is not the color list . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes . in the color list you will need to do two new attributes . then select this entry twice ( you can use this also more frequently , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
select in the object tree jed@@ es@@ mal and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this step should be simply done , as you should have understood the basic mode of work of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you should be understood as easily as the ground : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . place the ball contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball must float above the ground as you have shifted the ground around a unit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; naturally , yields now yields a strange result : as already see before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . set out a suitable material in the following step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have selected the ball , you can add a material now . just like the bottom , enter the ball a pig@@ ment than color : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choose your first object and modify the name for example in ball pig@@ ment . click on the pig@@ ment , then select Unic@@ ol@@ oured and adjust the values as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take time , stop some finish properties : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
change the values like in the following screen shots and click on instructions or press the input button .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brightness effect and reflection results in partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal is not selected : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you should now have a good impression of what opportunities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er , offers . hopefully you &apos;ve learned so much that you can create simple but nice scenes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ tra@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two dimensional picture of a three dimensional scene or model .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you ra@@ p a scene of ra@@ y@@ tra@@ ces , the ren@@ unci@@ ation hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera , reflects the visual effects of the lights in the scene and how atmospheric effects work as mi@@ sts . ) the scene will be processed for pixel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t see the camera without a camera , the camera is simply black . obviously , the picture is simply black . obviously the scene needs to be taken , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
opens a file . in the standard file dialog you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whenever you can open or create a new model , the file will be inserted in this sub@@ menu and replaced the oldest entry in the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you need to enter a name and space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rest@@ ores the scene in the last saved version . all changes have been ej@@ ected since the last update .
you can only select this menu item when you haven &apos;t added any changes listed in the scene .
repeat the last updated command . you can only select this menu item when you use editing .
store the current window order and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this menu , you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cuts and the default behaviour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change it with this option pre@@ set short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; add or add new commands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens a dialog to create tool@@ bars . you can add , add and remove the tool@@ box for the tool@@ s with this option . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a pump map is a possibility to treat rough surfaces without having to model , without changing any bal@@ es on the surface and without changing the geomet@@ ric shape of the object itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is common to use the same file for a B@@ ump @-@ Map as well as for a texture map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basic bodies are simple geomet@@ ric shapes , which you can use as blocks : very complex 3D models are generated from dozens or even hundreds of those fundamental bodies . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic look . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis using an image file as a color card .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the picture or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can click with the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or press Return .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can set , whether each image should be displayed in your own window , or if all images should always use the same window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you are looking for a specific file you simply type the first characters of the fil@@ en@@ ame in your browser window . then a small input field appears in the bottom right corner . when a suitable file name is created . then you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the dialog box - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show , there are five cards . in three of them , General and Mach@@ ining and Sli@@ deshow , you can set the mode of work &amp; short commands for the browser window and short commands for the windows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the picture is not large enough to fill the screen in full screen mode , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color , which you can adjust further down . default is not full screen mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this point is enabled , invites &amp; bul@@ lets show ; even the next picture in the folder , while you choose to see the current picture , and is especially suitable for a slideshow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this option stores &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; when closing the name of last opened folder . next start opens &amp; ball show ; this folder will be opened in the browser window .
click on the colored beams to fill a background color . this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . when in the window mode the window is larger than the image is filled with the selected color .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can and ball show , so that only some of the file types are displayed , which can also display the program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this option , the display window is enlarged to the full screen . this option is switched on as default . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
speci@@ fies if the slideshow can start with the first picture in the folder or the selected image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the time span between the screen change in a slide show . to change the value , you can input a new value in the input field or the small arrows on the right beside the input field . the default is 3 seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the number of repeti@@ tions is set to 0 the slide show is repeated so long until it is canc@@ eled by the user . to change the value or the small arrows on the right beside the input field . the default is 1 .
change the short@@ cuts here for the various modes of &amp; ball show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display and short commands for the browser .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the file system ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in one window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
displays large symbols for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short display .
displays small symbols for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short display .
displays thumb@@ nails for files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short display .
the image shr@@ inks by 10 % . the factor is based on the current size of the image .
enlarged the picture by 10 % . the factor is based on the current size of the image .
includes the display case for the images . &amp; ball show ; will also be closed when no browser windows is opened .
view the image in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the fil@@ en@@ ame , select the file . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; image processing based on the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing . &amp; show@@ room ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ plug ; project page .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a quick image processing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the rest of &amp; K@@ DE ; &amp; show@@ photo ; an Open Source project . this means it depends on that the user reports its part , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the menu will show you as easy as possible error or potential improvements . if you use this menu , your browser opens a page to reports of problems and wishes . all required information is already complete , and you can simply follow the instructions for giving your message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers may help each other . if you want to answer any other users of &amp; show@@ room . in this Mail@@ ing list you will be able to answer any other users again . in this mail@@ ing@@ list English language you should be powerful .
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ room ; to take part in the developer mail@@ ing@@ list . guide to the Beit@@ er of the Mail@@ ing list from &amp; show@@ photo ; .
&amp; show@@ photo ; try to give as much control over his work processes as you can . there are many options that change the behaviour of &amp; show@@ room ; to change them in the Settings menu . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the icons of the page .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the exposure indicators you can select the color , which is shown when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure @-@ dict@@ ator should display . under@@ exposure should display a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge that provides important information and promotions to the selected pictures . you can also view these pages in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images which do not work more than images to scan and car@@ pl@@ ers .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan and store images which do not work more than images to store and save the images in a given folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display images before dro@@ pping .
you can check the status of support of your scanner at the s@@ ane project page by using the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ Fo@@ t@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog is opened to choose the scanner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the user can select the scanner which you use , and press OK to open the scanner . exit &amp; sk@@ an@@ ite ; finish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other settings include more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) these options do not treat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to can@@ find a picture , the user can only start a preview and then run the scanning area for the final scan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to better choose the picture , the user can zoom into the image and select from the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom into the window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the picture is selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when before saving a preview shown in the settings , the picture is shown in a preview window as shown below , the image will be saved , and sch@@ lie ? EN leads to a demo@@ lition and you get back to the main window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the button settings , the same named dialogue will be opened before the main window . you can change the main settings here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the user can preview the image if desired , before saving before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview before saving the user . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this setting allows them to select the type as &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; images saves the dialog in front of any designated picture . if &amp; sc@@ an@@ l@@ ite opens them automatically with a generated name in a previously defined file then you need to query without after a fil@@ en@@ ame to query .
this setting defines where the images are saved without after a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are saved to save a file name . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this parameter defines a image pre@@ fix for the automatically converted images and is additionally displayed by a numer@@ ical Su@@ ff@@ ix of each time , when a picture is saved . the string # # # will be replaced by the numbers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the user can adjust the image quality to save the image quality . if select the image quality , the default value is not used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the button help starts the K@@ DE @-@ Help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; button above starts the K@@ DE about dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; the button Settings displays the dialog for Settings and Connect can be used to finish &amp; sk@@ an@@ ite ;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used like all other programs of the short@@ cuts . here you can define a list of these short@@ cuts in the player window , click on the right mouse button to click on the player window and select short commands to select ... select . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you may need to set up existing multimedia keys in such a way that they as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ short commands work . this makes your keyboard to the Amar@@ ok ; control centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface from Amar@@ ok has many general functions that can usually be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P function , playlist , playlist , playlist , and z@@ b ; look like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE ; additionally Amar@@ ok has some own command line options .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should you give the user a feedback if the script is not executed due to a lack of depen@@ dency , please check if all the required modules are present and use k@@ dialog when a script does not run . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the scripts / template , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can simply use them as a basis for your own scripts or simply converting them to the required functions . you will quickly find that scripts are relatively simple . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use de@@ co@@ p ; that should be enclosed with any K@@ DE installation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most scripts feature the exec@@ uting of external programs and commands . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can mostly be called . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here an example in Python :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; send messages to all running scripts . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default entries and react accordingly to events . of course a script should also ignore the events when it does not use it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
configure script displays the script . to store and loading the device data you need to take care of each script . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the work folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; track@@ Change shows that a new piece is played . the script might now query further information about the new piece ( for example , the metadata or the unit length ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
volum@@ et@@ Change new@@ volume sign@@ alizes a change in volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ men@@ u@@ cli@@ c : sub@@ menu item - contains the path to the selected files in the playlist . in order to add a custom menu entry to the menu you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok@@ ay@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) to be removed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; or when the user stops a script , send &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal is S@@ IG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed , e.g. saving data or configuration settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Amar@@ o@@ ks &apos; script management can also install script packages that can be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) which is optionally also available with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) that the user can clearly recognize the archive as Amar@@ o@@ Script script package .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the broad@@ ening amar@@ oc@@ script . for this reason , you should immediately ren@@ ame your script packages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) and the rest of the modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar @-@ parameter -@@ p to get the file rights :
if your script package is ready , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org with the link to the Wik@@ i scripts side of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on K@@ DE @-@ apps you should use the Amar@@ o@@ ok list .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist , instead of using endless menus . perhaps search for a very specific title for thousands in your collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you would like to hear ? then the playlist will automatically choose the right music after specific criteria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain depen@@ dencies have to be met with that they can be used . details on the system requirements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
activ@@ ates de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help you develop &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should be able to use full full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without effort using the setup dialog . the setup dialog has multiple flash@@ cards to setup the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
player window displays the player window in addition to the playlist and / or off . if the option is off , only the play@@ lists window is displayed .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; atmospheric design : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar , the colour scheme for the mood is changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dis@@ covering the music files at the music files : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if this setting is activated , .@@ mood files in the settings folder of the respective music files are stored ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you will be started when a browser is needed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use other browsers : here , you can specify the path to another browser , which is not included in the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , based on the playlist . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files will be saved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to keep the pieces visible on the part of the window , that the play@@ lists window will take up / off , in order to keep the continuous pieces always in the visible window industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
changes in the context of the context into the context of the context and automatically re@@ covers the context of the context as soon as the next piece is played .
in the corporate identity you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is divided in three parts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the font section , you can select the use of various fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; by selecting different typ@@ ef@@ ul@@ lab@@ s you can select the following area : play@@ lists window , player windows and context browser . select your font from the selection dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the selection of customized colour scheme , you even have the source of choice and allows you to use your own color scheme . use the activated colour selection for front and background color . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; playback at the start brings rise that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , playback will automatically continue with the piece in place , with which they hal@@ ted at last finish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sub@@ window On @-@ Screen Display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . when on @-@ screen display , a preview of O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first option is the font . click on selecting the font for the O@@ SD , selecting the text font shown in the O@@ SD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to customize own colors , you can use the possibility to select the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . a click on the color areas opens the dialog to color selection . if O@@ wn colors are not checked , the pre @-@ set &amp; K@@ DE are used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the input field displays text displayed in the O@@ SD text . by entering plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adjusted to your own needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholder and what they mean . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama user . thus , you can define on which screen from a multi @-@ monitor environment the O@@ SD is to appear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the card chart can select an audio driver from the drop down box , and some drivers enable additional adjustment possibilities in this card . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection , which includes the folder and type of database for the collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here you can select the folder , select &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in order to include a folder to the collection using the selected folders . this section also includes check boxes , such as the selected folders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; browse sub@@ folders : this causes , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the cru@@ ised as well as their sub@@ folders to music is well known . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
monitor changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders based on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) to make the necessary changes to your collection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; import play@@ lists : causes , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collection folder ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection will then appear later in the play@@ lists web browser . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the part of the Colle@@ ctive database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : , you can select between SQ@@ Lite or MySQL . if MySQL is selected , another device is required in the sub@@ window MySQL device . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the MySQL facility is used for inser@@ ting the database for &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; used under machine : the MySQL database is specified below which the database is specified below . name : is the database name to which the database is established .
use username : and password : to enter the data you need to connect to the database .
the card mapping is last@@ .@@ f@@ m is a support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can provide the names of rehear@@ sed pieces at a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations in terms of the current unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , enter your User@@ name and Password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; send forth pieces and upgrade the profile : this attitude allows it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
similar per@@ formers : after activation of this setting is called &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters can be viewed in the context of your browser . note : you will not need relief .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix Systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . further information is available in the summary of features , and gallery with screen shots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs so no other K@@ DE packages . you need to be installed k@@ deli@@ bs ( including the programs included in it ; for example modules or scripts ) . we have just written a small guide how to comp@@ ile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some functions like O@@ SD will require that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org , for example , we try Amar@@ o@@ box to support all platforms , so we use cro@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , as these constitute an excellent development environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
probably you will add a bug in the Tag@@ li@@ b library for days . you can also check the file in the Tag@@ li@@ b library under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and will also report this bug to the crash . after that you can delete the file and leave the collection again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the time is that Tag@@ lib when reading the Meta @-@ Info from this file , please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is something sophisticated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make sure that all of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; used libraries with the same compiler version , if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; but then comp@@ ile with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ x . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then disable automation . if in@@ active for ... in setting the Sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace back by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens in a crash ) , and you can send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be guaranteed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is because many program write data as UTF @-@ 8 in Meta @-@ Info , but do not fix it as Unicode . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
# ! / us@@ r / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ day = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ day ; print &quot; error when writing the tags of $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &apos; . $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ day , amp ; UT@@ F8 ) ;
this script needs the MP3 module MP3 : : Mp@@ 3 . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : mp3 lib .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the stat@@ us@@ bar ( random patterns / repeti@@ tive playlist ) can be seen in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known error in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . please note that in some cases you have to click on a icon until this setting will display its effect .
if you get this error : cat@@ amar@@ ca : symbol indicates error : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pix@@ eli@@ mit : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pix@@ fix library . this can be found with ld@@ d &apos;s amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error you might need to remove any col@@ li@@ di@@ zing Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ conf if Amar@@ ok will find the right version first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are some possibilities . most installation problems clari@@ fy the easiest by using your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or using the developers , using the IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to look for help . please enter there only one error if there is something about the correction of an error in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only an empty playlist will appear . how do music pieces come into there ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is simple , use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the start window into the statisti@@ c window was turned into the statisti@@ c window . you will find it at ex@@ tras statistics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ o@@ 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are calculated for evalu@@ ating the user , while the points are calculated automatically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to evaluate small pieces , each playlist must be displayed in the playlist . click anywhere on the list of each playlist . click anywhere in the list box . just click anywhere when Amar@@ o@@ ok is in the background . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the files you want to remove , and press release on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then choose from playlist menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drag a playlist file with your mouse to the playlist and let them fall there , just as you would like it with other files . that &apos;s how simple it is : - ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the tool@@ bar , right next to the Add button , the button is located to the playlist . click on it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
probably the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config would probably be missing to you . install the package X@@ M@@ MS @-@ max@@ el and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package includes many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the equ@@ alizer is located in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) , and you will also find it via the menu bar under Extras Reg@@ ulations .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; none . yes , this really is true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is the real issue of what kind of media support is supporting G@@ asp@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / N@@ DE@@ mm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you see , we support this pretty much every conc@@ eivable audio format . G@@ asp@@ amer can even de@@ code lyrics and P@@ NG ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it may ! perhaps you will not use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which in the pre@@ set no MP3 Decoder has been provided ( for pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : alt @-@ F2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 K@@ DE .
start the Y@@ ast online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s ab : - )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use the g@@ link driver using the Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink , the device must use a bl@@ ender and simultaneously connect the device to the same time ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the output of this command should help you in search of the problem and a solution . for G@@ iss@@ amer , you may need to indicate another link ( e.g. os@@ s@@ cars ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this does not do and Amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must be de@@ coded first . g@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you need a de@@ code and send the PCM data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just as x@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really magnificent ! ) or optim@@ ise the settings of sound . select sound server with highest priority ( real @-@ time pri@@ or@@ atory ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see the next item of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ sw@@ ra@@ ctor SU@@ ID is set : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia co@@ dec@@ s , which can cause st@@ aging playback . read this error report . the En@@ large sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either do not use the Arts Driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE key to get the faster Arts Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ c &amp; etc ; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; probably use the Arts Dri@@ vers . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the buff@@ ers , the less than the visu@@ aliz@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us to fix it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ asp@@ amer is installed , but if I want to change to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crash@@ es &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the installation of G@@ Stre@@ amer , you will need to register all components . run G@@ ST file , to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask in IR@@ C @-@ channel # g@@ bin@@ amer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try this ( exit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Lo@@ ad vent file , comp@@ ile and install it as a system administrator and once again as your normal user . delete the G@@ ST file folder , please run G@@ ST @-@ config file and run G@@ ST file . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
please report under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. if you have a whole list of proposals / desires , send them best to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very and find that the name sounds good . furthermore , the name also contains the magic ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . put an alarm in your calendar program and run with the alarm to execute this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this command leaves &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play safely , make sure you go to bed , then you will be wo@@ ken up to bed , then you will be stopped before going to bed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do I get to know the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ongoing title if you are on another computer ?
if a working SSH environment is present you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpre@@ t and title of the current piece from SSH -@@ I ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ RSA _ id _ RSA _ id user Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and I@@ hr@@ User@@ name with your username . this requires that your identification is available in the file ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ RSA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; in a separate window , press on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer , in the size of changing windows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + right mouse button represents a piece in the queu@@ e track . by pressing the input button the first search result is played and the search returned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK , the player window and the playlist will have tri@@ ck@@ rich functions , but how does the icon in the Control strip look like ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n , click the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browser must be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is based on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database can not be created and on the console many errors appear .
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok on a local drive or use am@@ aro@@ K@@ s MySQL support .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play the CD , then select a file browser with multiple folders . select a few pieces and drag them into the desired target folder inside a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic code you will use files from folders mp3 or og@@ g . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically it fits the previous assessment with a cap@@ turing value , based on how often the piece was played . the less influence has been performed on the overall score . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can simply enter the rating for a piece by clicking on a column head in the play@@ lists window . then , you can click on a column in the play@@ lists . then , you can edit the evaluation or F2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the developers don &apos;t want to release you when you are going to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages must not bring together a set of release of the un@@ specified plan of Amar@@ ok . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a new feature in Amar@@ o@@ ok , but some users can also find ner@@ vi@@ g . disable the option symbol when playing in the general settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings tool@@ bars ... and take the desired changes there .

probably &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; compiled before using x@@ ine or g@@ asp@@ amer . therefore the . / configure routine does not comp@@ ile these output modules . you need to configure and install Amar@@ ok ; re @-@ configure and install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now I &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules are still not released . and now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; probably use a distribution to install the development files separated from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , you need to install the pack@@ et file . after that you need to re @-@ comp@@ ile and install x@@ ine @-@ dev@@ el . after that you need to re @-@ comp@@ ile and install it again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer Cri@@ tical * * : factory for &apos;@@ adder &apos; has no type .. how can I fix it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she compiled her version of G@@ Stre@@ amer , it is in@@ compatible with pre@@ mate . you have to comp@@ ile G@@ Stre@@ amer without pre@@ mate . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ TC : uses no LD@@ FLA@@ GS if you comp@@ ile Amar@@ ok . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there will be the error message there is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype au@@ dia / mp@@ 4 although the module g@@ bit fa@@ x@@ ad is installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play mp@@ 4 or M4@@ A files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , it must also be installed in the g@@ bit quick@@ time next to g@@ bit fa@@ x@@ ad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will receive the mistake there is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype Audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you play an MP3 stream , but the module g@@ stra@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run Amar@@ ok . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a second sound@@ card and use AL@@ SA . how can we use Amar@@ ok the second sound card ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; setting under Settings Amar@@ ok ... audio output , enter the device . typically , for example , HW : 0 for the standard sound card and HW : 1 for the second . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here you can see an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 code@@ c and an USB audio device :
p@@ c@@ m.@@ Which 8x@@ 0 { type digi@@ ti@@ v@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; HW : 0 &quot; } ct@@ l@@ .@@ intel@@ li@@ .@@ intel@@ li@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; HW : 1 &quot; } ct@@ l@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type HW @-@ 1 }
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter the setup dialog from x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of the sampling rate , channels and so on ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device to disable the tick check on the sound card m@@ map .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this attitude is not active , your playlist will grow continuously , and they will not be heard in this playlist , and they will play in this playlist using the already played pieces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; played pieces - this is the number of played pieces that should be kept at the beginning of the playlist . thus , you can easily see what pieces were recently played . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the number of tracks included in each played playlist . if you want to add more than 1 , the playlist will only be played , because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings on the right @-@ hand side are described already in the previous section . on the left hand side of the dialog , you can choose from existing play@@ lists and to add multiple play@@ lists ; random pieces from each of the crossed play@@ lists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some scripts enable your own settings . you can customize settings by launching the script , and then click on it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can open new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; scripts , where you can install on the script . after you install the script , a new entry will be installed directly from the Internet . you can also install new scripts directly from the internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not want to use a script longer , you can delete it . please click on Un@@ install script . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are looking for information on your own scripts , please take a look at the writing of scripts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the dialog window visu@@ alisation plug @-@ ins is used for activ@@ ating the available visu@@ aliz@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plug@@ ins . in order to use a plug@@ in next you activate the check box next to the name .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this quick start will show you how to create an audio CD in four steps ; in order to complete the steps , you must have a loud installation of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and create a folder with audio files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a dialog window , where you can select which files you want to burn on CD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 or other los@@ s@@ less compressed formats , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is created . you can check if a audio CD has been created from a los@@ sy format . use the au@@ CD@@ t@@ ect project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this dialog window you can &apos;t do anything . please wait until the calcul@@ ator completed the burning process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this quick start is to show you how to copy a CD @-@ CD in just four steps . to complete the steps , you have to have a loud installation of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and they have sli@@ pped the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for copying a data CD , please select Extras , CD ... from the menu . you can now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small lin@@ ux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and play automatically all videos in the base folder of the CD .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a convenient method , recently opened projects . the associated sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on one entry brings the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saves the current project . if the project has already been stored , the file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog box is displayed , with which you can choose folders and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
saves all opened projects . this is the same when you need to save up for each project file .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conclu@@ des the current project . if a project has been changed and not saved , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after what should be done . you can then cancel the closing time and keep the project so open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; includes all opened projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; will re @-@ ask for any project that is supposed to happen , just as you &apos;ve accessed for each project file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; includes all opened projects and finished &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for any data stored , what should be done thus , as if you had accessed the File Station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you call this entry , you can use the appearing dialog files to add to the project . if you click the files directly from the top view into the project file , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dialog will open dialog for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the Properties @-@ dialog of the Project . the only difference is the additional button burning , der &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for burning the medium it can only open when the project contains data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . every project type has different possible settings , most of which are described ? -@@ help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this entry will only appear with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it is useful to import files from a previous meeting in the current project . it is useful for you to view the files existing files and folders for you .
this entry will only appear with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes files from the current project . all other files will remain in the project . this function removes all files from the medium . they only merge the previously imported files .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the CD @-@ copying dialog . this also enables copying a CD to another medium . alternatively , you may also want to burn a copy of a CD instead of normal copying , if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the DVD @-@ copying dialog . this enables you to use a DVD to another medium instead of copying a DVD to another medium . also , it &apos;s also possible to use a DVD to another medium instead of copying the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens the dialog to form@@ atting a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) format which will complete the content complete . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; allows you to choose between writing modes and incre@@ mental . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
burn a previously set CD image . the dialog will not burn after a * .@@ is@@ o * .@@ rescue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source that will immediately not be supported by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not allowed to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
this is also burning a DVD image . the dialog will ask you after a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button .
a previously un@@ read DVD @-@ video may be converted . this dialog window will usually be used on the reading of a DVD in the syn@@ op@@ view . it contains information about the read video , code settings and even ways to change the size and cutting black edges .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shows information about the pic@@ kl@@ ed media . this information is displayed in the contents view and contain properties of the medium , such as size and title length of CD or DVD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shows a list of tool@@ bars by &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this is crossed , a small body is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden .
to@@ g@@ gles the folder view or out . the folder view contains an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . in case the content view is displayed . CD / DVD drives also includes a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and unlock the disc .
turn on the contents view or off . the content view enables selecting and drag files into the project view . the view is also chosen to read audi@@ o- or video CDs ( if a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD is selected in the folder view ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head@@ line represents a narrow range in the project view , which is only visible when the project view is visible , it looks only pretty and separates the project view from the other views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this opens a dialog window to change the keyboard orders for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after you have selected one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key assignment below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will start the K@@ 3@@ b ; alignment assist@@ ants for burning CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administr@@ ators will need to set the password for the system administr@@ ators ( root ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work on incen@@ tive , and this dialog is meant for person@@ alisation and fine tuning of the program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many others &amp; K@@ DE ; applications also , using a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled for example via a Sh@@ ell@@ script . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; you can use either the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . so both programs are key to the functions of the scope , which will give you the same program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this chapter , we assume you use command line utility d@@ co@@ p . to make sure you have to make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b is started . then enter something like the following in the console : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , all &amp; K@@ DE ; program common , supported &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts that are described below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface from &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; features functions like copy@@ ri@@ ghted , format@@ ted DVD and other functions for creating new projects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

as a result of such a cre@@ at@@ e@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you can create a D@@ CO@@ P reference on the newly created project : # K@@ 3@@ b -@@ K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b @-@ Interface is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface which can only be used on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then folder files into the new folder : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD player ; out @-@ read for &amp; K@@ DE ; with it you can easily read audio CD and also other formats are possible depending on the encoder installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD files ; files in WAV files on the hard disk ) and from many Ko@@ di@@ fiers to be installed ( compressed ) for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) . more co@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , the title of the &amp; CD is read and stored in WAV files on the machine ( loss @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) is compressed into the MP@@ 3 or OGG format or other formats such as the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD , it is used by &amp; co@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not installed , it has to be done now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the second step ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ pre ( for OGG ) or other co@@ ders installed . all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distri@@ butions . however , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile any other Linux distri@@ butions . if , for example FLA@@ C cannot be used , it is not necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which coding / file format should be used ? the chapter Which co@@ ders will give you a small introduction about Ko@@ di@@ erer , audio quality and compression factors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already mentioned ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used to read the audio data from the &amp; CD . this program is not intended to read any protected audio CD . in any case it can not be able to use any protected audio CD . simply avoid the mechanism of copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the setup has to be made only once ( the setup dialog only has to be called up to a suitable configuration ) , after the daily use of reading a CD . this leads to an understanding of the slim approach of the user interface , through which you will frequently stum@@ ble on the start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can convert many formats - depending on which coding programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can &amp; CD release from Free@@ D@@ b from the internet or can work completely without network , where everything is manually captured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only a brief list of commands in the main window . on the page step , for example , you will find further information such as this program is used as well as screenshot for the configuration of the program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; starting the CD@@ DB inquiry to the CD @-@ data according to the arrangement of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case must first be made the connection to the internet . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
start reading and - if a encoder is configured in the setup settings in the setup guide - encoding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens a sub@@ menu with a list of the available encoder , so that the selection can be read with another Encoder than the standard . it is configured to configure the encoder settings in the setup dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the file manager , making an already selected file to en@@ code will be selected instead of a complete &amp; CD player . read and en@@ code . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
opens the setup dialog for the kind of messages ( such as protocols , Pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for Progra@@ mmer &apos;s ( such as reading the &amp; CD ) .
opens the main setup dialog of &amp; co@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with various flash@@ cards ( like encoder , to setup the En@@ co@@ ders ) . you need to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ ders and compression ratios and helps you choose the correct coefficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if no audio information is to be lost , no los@@ s@@ less audio format is needed . next to FLA@@ C , there are also other than &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; Mon@@ key &apos; which may be used to playback these files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the audio formats that lose information by data compression according to their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG have the most common bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but over this bit@@ rate the differences are less important because both co@@ ders produce very good audio quality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
O &apos;@@ Not so &apos; free but l@@ ame is supplied with the majority of the distri@@ butions for free but there are open license issues
+ High to very high quality sound ( at high bit@@ rates ) but compared to OGG slightly lower quality at lower bit@@ rates .
OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG actu@@ ators is present .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special Auto stereo systems . nowadays , these devices usually support the MP3 format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a short list with parameters for audio quality and resulting compression ratios for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &apos; --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = This attitude is usually able to offer most people and most of the music , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi audio equipment with high quality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 until 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi audio equipment with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate around 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi audio equipment with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good recovery for the music by adolescents and portable devices and car stere@@ otyp@@ es . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &apos; --@@ pre@@ set Ins@@ ane &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you want absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &amp; CD provided by the program can be edited manually or by the program automatically generated by the program as a list of parameters . you can use / needed / used as a list of parameters and to create the file names and the characteristics of the music files .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the coding and these parameters here . the manual or help to Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ern explain the switches for these programs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example to add the &amp; CD title to the keywords ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are encoded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ tt of l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator must be added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; audi@@ ts ; parameters which can be used ( = button name in the assistant ) :
that is what the Free@@ D@@ b is : a free database to read / enter the audio CDs that you can download / enter the information instead of yourself in the machine : &amp; CD : title , artist names , names of pieces &amp; etc ; not from the audio file itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , it should be legal , but I don &apos;t think that you are missing from the &amp; CD . however , the artist can &apos;t be added to the music business . all information can be obtained with a bum@@ ble by a &amp; CD , business , physical or virtu@@ ell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this kind of configuration , the e @-@ mail address is not used in this kind of configuration . in this type of configuration , the e @-@ mail address is not used when invo@@ ke the server ( This can only know the programmer that has checked the code . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in many countries , there are copies of the main database . if &amp; co@@ audi@@ o@@ ists are set up , the ge@@ o should be used to use Free@@ D@@ b . this saves bandwidth in the network and re@@ sembles the load between the hosts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org delivers a recent list of mirror servers for the online call of &amp; CD . information during reading a &amp; CD . if alternatively the entire database can be downloaded or ( usually monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is rum@@ ours that there is cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ; who wants to know , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CDs ; see it has to be installed first , if this has not yet been done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to save the read @-@ read WAV files , the Ko@@ di@@ ver and the FLA@@ C ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( combination @-@ free compression for audio data ) can be added on the tab . other co@@ ders can be added on this tab . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution , before the co@@ ders may be used . this is also necessary for the pre@@ defined Ko@@ di@@ ers . more on Ko@@ di@@ ver can be found in the warmer Ko@@ di@@ erer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after installing a Ko@@ di@@ ver &apos;s installation , you can get further information about the switches such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this can have many causes . check the device of the device name of the &amp; CD and / DVD drives that are either cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia as well as the audio @-@ codes of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) . please try to give both programs with a command line in a terminal .
check if you do not want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD . please check the cover of the &amp; CD player ; this will not succeed !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a chapter with a step @-@ by @-@ step example . even if you use other settings , this may be tips how to proceed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have you read the complete manual and understood everything but are somehow still un@@ sure what to do ? well , and you will get enough information to set up those fields that make the program exactly what you want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this example we will start the program for the first time you can set up everything and use our first &amp; CD . we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable Bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it need to be cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution , as it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , whatever you can do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
please make sure that the directory / us@@ r / share / cd includes and that you have read cri@@ es on it ( eg ; by trying to copy anything inside ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first section handles the basic setup of &amp; co@@ audi@@ o@@ ists ; , something that is likely to be done once and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD player ; what has to be repeated for each calling &amp; CD .
here we determine the compression of the compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 until 256 k@@ bps ) . as we are lazy to use the program containing Free@@ D@@ b to download the CD provided .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although we may change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them at any time out of a &amp; CD , when the matching settings are found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the device name is handed over to the output program and it can read the &amp; CD @-@ data / pieces .
frequently / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real name of your running process . if this is not working or if more than a CD / DVD drive can also be used on the drive with other program entries for the CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the card file General Settings . here &apos;s not a lot to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything will be shown / entered as shown in the screenshot picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only for full information qu@@ eries , so you will be informed when information about the creation of keywords ( tags ) are missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the card mapping CD ; -@@ settings . simply select both entries . we are com@@ fy and allow the &amp; CD to download the data on the Internet from a Free@@ D@@ b machine .
note : the calcul@@ ator must be connected to the Internet during reading the &amp; CD player ; so that it can access the Free@@ D@@ b server .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD . entries found immediately . if you are dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the result list , the ID3 tags will be changed using K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; K@@ DE ; tag@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from this example , please note : if you want to insert everything manually . however , you can use Free@@ D@@ b locally in offline mode , the two selection boxes will be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following box card . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD@@ DB is for us Free@@ D@@ b . this is settings for the data @-@ request for the calling of the CD . how does the system know what data to get the CD ? read the section on Free@@ D@@ b . read all this as shown in the screenshot picture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org site and look after a mirror server in your vicinity . on this way the load is distributed between the hosts . this setting will work as first attempt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both works equivalent to the server as well as many fire@@ walls as standard , but maybe more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this example , we do not want to transmit any CD : data to the Free@@ D@@ b server . the first check box should be enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
simply take the settings from the screen picture . ( make sure that the folder / t@@ mp exists on your computer )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; number of simultaneous pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive ? they don &apos;t know , so simply try yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CD : after reading the last piece , check this out around the &amp; CD : throwing at the end of the trial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; user @-@ defined file for temporary files : if you have to check this folder , then the folder / folders can be saved in which the files will not be saved when you want to make this folder when you want to make some WAV files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anything like this is at the screen picture . the command is something long , under the circumstances anything must be fli@@ pping to the right to see everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , the resulting bit@@ rate is sufficient for excellent audio quality , even for very good stereo hi @-@ quality . the resulting compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
notice the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for limitation to the creation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags may be also deleted when required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an internal variable in the name of the input file ( including the complete path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) .
put the rest like in your screen photo . some comments for future use outside this example :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; number of simultaneously codi@@ fication WAV files : in case of a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine , you can try to code more than a WAV file at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is what we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; co@@ audi@@ o@@ creator . this configuration is used as a default for any reading &amp; CD . if you have chosen the organisational structure of your music you never need to change it again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this section , it is described as the process of reading the &amp; CD . we will set up a connection to the internet . it will be built in the previous section and we will be able to pick up the disc into this section , must be repeated for each issu@@ ing &amp; CD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as we have a &amp; CD player that &apos;s not included in Free@@ D@@ b the screen pictures are slightly different than the data collected for a CD . so you will learn the &amp; CD player if you want to get out of the internet . comments are available to the differences .
try not the &amp; CD : this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of this manual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this is not yet done , the &amp; CD now has to be put into the drive , which is defined in the main window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as shown in the screen picture . this only when the CD @-@ CD has been identified and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia can be read . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this is not done , search in the section questions and answers by the help or go back to the previous section on the basic settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attention : if the CD has been picked up from Free@@ D@@ b , all the titles of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and album are shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD player ; Key to your &amp; CD player , and you can select the database entry , which your opinion will be best to your &amp; CD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you don &apos;t have the check box for the automatic query of Free@@ D@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; -@@ settings in the dialog for the Settings ) can be selected manually by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have any local database but you need access to the Internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first unit
specify the data for your and CD : according to the pattern on the next screen picture . the title of the title in the first line of the &apos; actu@@ ator &apos; records the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the artist must not be entered in the input field &apos; actu@@ ator &apos; , unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply for all pieces of the CD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attention : after the successful recall of data from Free@@ D@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it &apos;s always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor ( e.g. all words with big letters or not ... ) , but also to examine whether there are any unwanted remarks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and at least 28 characters . this option is set up to the encoding tab . do not have a look at the &apos; Basic Settings &apos; section .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time with the Tag Editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tags are not supported by all coding and file formats . see how to get more information in the body to get more information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just opt for an entry which corresponds to the style of the issu@@ ing CD . in this example , this is not important as we go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about categories . pop or R@@ ap for example can be found under rock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , return to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD editor window appears again and you see that the fields are already filled with the entered data , which we recorded for the first piece . enter the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the CD .
attention : this window doesn &apos;t appear when you downloaded the Free@@ D@@ b data . it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed on the list of items .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note that there is a check @-@ in before every line of a piece . only the tracks are selected , or choose the button to select all pieces at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when clicking the button select selecting the reading process , this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we will have a look at the window with the orders and track what expi@@ res . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click on the rider orders to switch on the order window . it is in the left top half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is currently read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this error message will see if you try to work with a Ko@@ di@@ ver , which you have not installed . pieces which were not successfully codes are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target folder are not what we have entered here for the temporary files and target folders ? ; - ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now it &apos;s clear why the error has occurred directly after the end of reading the first piece .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is to read and code in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the author of the program has no configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that configur@@ able , is the number of parallel processes to read and en@@ code the result of powerful machines ( however , it does not seem to have two different pieces ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the last title is read , while another piece is coded and a third order is coded in the queu@@ e of the body . after the last piece is encoded , a small window with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window appears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the successful use of &amp; co@@ audi@@ o@@ ists ; , you &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG , you need the tap of your choice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is maintained today within the &amp; K@@ DE ; CVS as part of the dec@@ ep@@ un@@ media package ; if you already know a pre @-@ compiled package . most distri@@ butions have already a pre @-@ compiled package . if you read this you have probably already done ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this section is directed to people , compiled by source files , and not for users intended to use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are looking for assistance like the program can be adjusted to your needs , then the following is right for you : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a program that calls many different programs , has many variants at settings . at best read the step for step example to get the options and settings . it also displays comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hello , I still read on ? even if only the help menu has been clicked before starting from this somehow empty screen ( especially when the program boot is not an audio CD , or from the un@@ usually short menu ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s it ? who read this , probably already the program has started . it should look somehow like this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author cannot do this hand@@ book . it is the first version to add or change this manual . and if you read this , he does not agree with this proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strange if you have succeeded in getting the source file from &amp; K@@ DE ; SV@@ N ; then you don &apos;t need these ind@@ ents but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ aoke files of &amp; K@@ DE ; besides others it has also not have some characteristics that others &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; K@@ DE ; support works on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; K@@ DE ; support works on all systems . AL@@ SA is being included as soon as it supports a sequence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s simple to follow the piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
graphic display of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag in &amp; K@@ DE ; any MIDI file from a &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to the Mid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; supports the two existing standards , to save text in MIDI files ( song property or text events ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
seat support . if you exit &amp; K@@ DE ; during the playing of a song K@@ mid starts the next time with the same song .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , you can open ... from the menu item . it appears the usual file dialogue with which help you choose the desired song . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can also insert a file from a &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; window in the &amp; k@@ mid ; this will also work with multiple songs at the same time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play a piece of music , open it and click the button to play in the tool@@ bar , select the entry file from the menu item or get the space bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts , as soon as you move it on the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played each other . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the k@@ mid play a piece , you can jump to any spot by using the middle mouse button and drive back with the regulator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you find that a song is too fast or slow off , you can click on the arrows on the left and the right of the speed display . to return the original speed , double click on Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a print on the space bar appears as a pressure on the button pause or the selecting the menu bar while no piece is played , start &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
song lyrics can be saved to two types in one piece of music . some pieces use textile box and other both . some pieces do not have any text : - )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can configure which events will be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically selected , so you &apos;ll have the option to change this if you want to change the other way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to set an event type , select the entries to text items or property events . the same function also includes buttons 1 and 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you can summar@@ ise . in this section , you will be able to make collections efficiently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create a collection , open the collection manager . you will find this in the menu Collection under the item Organ@@ ize .... Click here on New and give the name for the collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying , then copy the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the outline in the collection manager . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the temporary collection includes all the songs , which you want to add to any other collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when leaving the application , this collection is not saved . remember that if you add many pieces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to add songs to a collection , it has to be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song to add to what help you choose the desired song . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the automatic addition to the collection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece will be added to the active collection using opening files or Drag &amp; Drop ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Automati@@ cally add to the collection is not checked , a temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then added to some opened pieces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click on removing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can select the order in which the songs can be played , when you select the set off the menu sequence of the menu theme , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be defined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to jump a song , choose the next song , the record next song from the menu or press the arrow on the right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to jump back a song , choose the button previous piece from the menu or press the arrow arrow on the left . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , choose the collection manager there and click on the button del@@ eting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted , but this doesn &apos;t matter , since it is not stored when leaving the &amp; k@@ mid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers that are not General @-@ MIDI , in this case the MIDI @-@ map General @-@ MIDI events in events that under@@ stands syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map which convert all events of type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et , making it always a trumpet should play when originally playing a piano . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you only have a sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI map because all the Sound@@ cards are compatible with GM ( including AW@@ E and G@@ US cards , FM equipment and so on ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI maps , so you have to edit the appropriate file by hand ( using your favorite text editor ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all needed requirements for the playback of a piece .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each section must appear only once , except the Key@@ map section which may appear so often as desired . pre@@ condition for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Name of Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; A further key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D
see that de@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section begins ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please send me your map file as email , so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be compatible with devices that are not General @-@ MIDI compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this section , the patches of General MIDI is shown on your specific keyboard . general use looks as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . so it is assumed that the GM patches are in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so do not change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the optional All@@ key@@ s@@ To M is needed to lay down all tones at the tone with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) that you use the following in the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so if now , a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 ( guns ) , it takes around 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of what sound stands in the MIDI file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please note that here with the term drum patch the patch includes , at which each tone is a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist instrument ( Dr@@ ums , pools , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc . ) , does not mean the pitch of the always same tum@@ our ( as it may own some keyboards ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Key@@ map section is used to indicate how sounds on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as in the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important as its presence . so you must create 128 entries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can define various key@@ maps for each channel and every instrument . you just have to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ maps are used primarily to form tones on the perc@@ us@@ sions channel . take a look as an example the provided Key@@ maps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this section can be used to arrange some channels to others , if you want to exchange for the first and second channel , do it simply in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , these settings are useful for Key@@ boards which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , and others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; n is the channel , which is depicted on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , all events will be ignored in this channel when you use the For@@ ce@@ patch option to change the patch on this channel . in this case always Patch x will be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the For@@ ce@@ patch option can be useful to use the perc@@ us@@ sion@@ al patch on the perc@@ us@@ sions channel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio amounts to , in which ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der events are calculated and then passed first . the value 40@@ 96 is used , so that in the map file no dec@@ im@@ als are available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this setting is needed because GM is going to play a pitch with the value 40@@ 96 to play a note up to one oc@@ tave up . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit using &amp; mid ; try . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use a MIDI map , just open the MIDI settings dialog . you can find this in the menu under settings , item MIDI settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the channel view is a window with a whole line of pi@@ vi@@ als ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on this pi@@ vi@@ atures , you can see what sounds are currently being played . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the channel view has ( up to now ) two different views to view the played sounds . in the menu Settings , select &quot; Settings &quot; in the Settings menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speed LCD displays the speed , with which a song is played . the higher the number , the bigger the speed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so you can change the temp@@ o of a song . if you find it , a song is too fast to change the text , use the arrows to change the speed and turn right from the LCD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a MIDI file is a file which needs to be played like a piece of music . it contains the same MIDI file on two different devices , as well as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , I can &apos;t force anyone ; but using a typical MIDI file , you can use a similar sound quality ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer , you can also change the single instruments , speed &amp; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this can happen if you have compiled a distribution distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; to fix the problem you have to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not agree to simply supports &amp; drop , drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add to &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in advance , activate the automatic addition to the collection . otherwise the files will be added to a temporary collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can mix the arrow keys on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD , to slow playing . to double the standard temp@@ o you can double click on the LCD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;ve installed on a &amp; K@@ DE ; desktop a &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI folder and / k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I want to play a MIDI file ) or I want to play a file only in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or file . I need to change the file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you just want to listen to a file without entering a collection , turn the automatic addition to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . open files &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s assume you only want to play the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. assignment just once you want to add or open a temporary collection , just this a MIDI file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then do you decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid , and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you so much ! when I hear these songs , edit the postcard , encourage me to write to &amp; k@@ mid ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for my hob@@ bies . I studied mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a , I try to take a little time for my hob@@ bies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , I study program , MIDI files , make music and pro@@ positions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files if you want to make a question please write an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or else if you just want to make me happy an e @-@ mail : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you send me a postcard from your location or a MID@@ I@@ - / Kar@@ aoke file , will send me a postcard or a MIDI file . before you can send me a MIDI file , you should contact me if I already have a MIDI file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have written and k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and I want to empha@@ size your money , so I just want to progra@@ m@@ programming , because / when I get feedback of users ( postcards and e @-@ mails ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wai and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - correction of the bug that the pitch was too high at AW@@ E cards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my thanks also applies to Jose L@@ us San@@ chez for testing the G@@ US support , reference Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and of course my thanks also applies to all these excellent musicians on the net that give us these wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition to this can be found &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on his website which can be found under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ous@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ ht@@ ml . there you can find links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs and others ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , since the sound quality depends greatly on your sound card . it is not the same if you use a FM radio or AW@@ E card . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not have a sound card , you need to comp@@ ile your sound , using the MO@@ DE _ D@@ EM@@ O _ ON@@ LY@@ VI@@ SU@@ AL . it then runs as if you would not have a sound@@ card , except that you can &apos;t listen to music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you are having problems please contact one of the &amp; K@@ DE ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files of M@@ Player or ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as playback of DVD s , VCD , TV and camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the documentation for &amp; cro@@ pping was not yet finished as &amp; K@@ DE ; installed on this computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for additional help , please check the K@@ DE website on new versions , or send the question to The &amp; K@@ DE ; User Mail@@ ing list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application window is made of so called and@@ o@@ bi@@ dden windows . there is always the window with the playlist . and finally there is a window with the playlist . and finally , there is a window window that will display only when you are going to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is possible to send the preferred links under the book@@ marks menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries , you should use the category continuous playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarch@@ ical trial . if you have done an entry , his group and all his sub@@ groups will be copied into the current category and playback begins with the ordered entry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the categories &apos; current pieces &apos; , Television and Permanent playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do it by editing a category . just click on a name for a category . simply the XML content of this part is displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after changing XML files , must be selected from the menu with the same playlist and select either the processing mode , or select another category . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all changes are lost when the processing mode leave , or another group is selected without using the playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the ease of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation when starting and closing can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c and modi@@ fying &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will convert the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / directory / k@@ m@@ player / Ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the animation when starting doesn &apos;t need short , it will automatically termin@@ ate by opening any other source . however , the user may end an application a second time at the end @-@ animation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; gt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; gt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; gt ; / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / .
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here the path can be set from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troub@@ les@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar from k@@ m@@ player . here the output of m@@ player is obvious .
there is no tab@@ s for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ master . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ de@@ c Mozilla will be played .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player , and can even be used to insert the special field Emb@@ ed for YouTube in the playlist XML . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so that the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module needs to be specified as a service provider for the M@@ ime Type Application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setup dialog box of K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or oder N@@ k@@ m@@ player ; can be found in a con@@ sol@@ ete application and after error messages concerning the loading of the browser module library . if no error occur here is the back@@ end output inside &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console or console from the context menu ) .
with this set always a given back@@ end for a certain M@@ ime Type ( of course only if this has been determined ) must be done through manual changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ master . for example Phon@@ on will play all og@@ g files :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play from TV cards , either by using M@@ Player or X@@ video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ Player ) . for this purpose the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or can manually edit the configuration file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to configure the V@@ DR ( video data rec@@ orders ) settings in k@@ m@@ player is the dialog in Settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there you should be found out of which one is selected . the correct name probably has a DVB to it .
since the V@@ DR support from k@@ m@@ player only can use X@@ video ( probably this kind of playing video devices under Linux should also work ) . this is also only available on the first screen ( : 0.@@ 0 ) and therefore it must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internally they are used by KM@@ Player for sources different names . at the time of origin of this documentation , dv@@ d@@ resource , t@@ v@@ scanner , t@@ end@@ source , t@@ end@@ source , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are activated , beginning with the playback of the playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are there indications like I can make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the VCD / / ) ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ e 8 / dev / c@@ drom is run as user root after connecting the device . it is absolutely sure to set out that / dev / c@@ drom is shown on the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine starts up slowly but why does my CPU need to be tested for their performance ?

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is required to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ ile ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lat@@ ex ; : a professional written application . among Unix @-@ like systems , most probably run on the package &amp; tex@@ ex ; respectively &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of these components can be included in the &amp; Linux board . for installation , documentation of the distribution and installation CD / DVD should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; k@@ ile ; Project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are on the k@@ ile , website included . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this hand@@ book is for everyone - regardless of experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; K@@ DE ; , &amp; &amp; Linux ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advanced users must hardly be able to read this manual . however , the support for this project or documentation should be made , should be made contact using the k@@ ile ; website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if any questions on or when comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ ile ; on or are extensions desired , this should be addressed to the mailing list k@@ ile @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ environment for the use of all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ functions in a graphical interface as well as conversion tools for these . lock@@ able ; the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant to be called lat@@ ex ; reference and powerful project management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to learn more about &amp; Kate and its possibilities to learn the manual on Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile , can begin directly using the editor of &amp; Kate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for fitting &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right choice : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . if it is difficult to use it is also possible to use a La@@ p ( English . lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros . a less demanding but more realistic solution is that it desc@@ ends from the last name of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; watch here only a good view to &amp; lat@@ ex ; is it not the ultimate book on this . to be able to handle &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as other en@@ vision@@ aries include &amp; lat@@ ex ; a introduction to the gener@@ alized properties such as paper formats , page number@@ ing and text windows , the opening begins with the command \ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the quick @-@ entry assistant to &amp; k@@ ile ; is a popular function for the creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; the selection of the document can also be made to create a document related to the document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
documentation : this is the type of a document that is created : articles ( items ) , book &#91; book &#93; , article &#91; letter &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , report &#91; reference &#93; , film &#91; Prosp@@ er &#93; or customized .
encoding : this is set to encoding the encoding . modern systems increasingly use UTF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . if they should increasingly operate UTF @-@ 8 encoding ( to correct processing of lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this list contains the most commonly used packages for lat@@ ex , for which they can only be selected in the check box . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; articles ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , Letter ( DIN ) : the documentation classes of Kom@@ a script ( to comply with the German DIN provisions ) should always be used in the preparation of German text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new users are therefore not worried anymore , just a short description of the functions and further information about this will be given in the section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers - just like other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . through &amp; k@@ ile ; you would like to create a simple problem with the modest appearance of the output file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the automatic legacy of the environments , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ \ } ) by &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically a blank line is created ( for input the text ) and the added line to the command at@@ ile ; setting up the La@@ Te@@ X commands automatically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all documents are typically sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex , the sub@@ division of the document in the following items ( part is the most beautiful and sub@@ divided element ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the document , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click on the respective window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be found very helpful . once a DVI ; file &#91; Back Time file &#93; was created , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking on the corresponding row in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in the lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document as well as other information such as font , conversion and printing from DVI ; files for printing and printing from DVI ; files for different systems and systems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when using the sensor search are the elements of the DVI ; file with the editor window . once upon a element in the DVI ; -@@ file the exact opposite is found . as soon as click on a section in the DVI ; -@@ source code is clicked on the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer .
Master document : this function is used in working with multiple files . using a master document it is made easier for working with different files . using a master document a project @-@ wide master document can be adjusted to project settings .
quick construction : the lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if no error in the source code is available ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surveillance of file surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is being applied to the planet and is not a call of &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when editing the Edit cap@@ e , the three large pad@@ dies should be show@@ c@@ ased for the rapid breakdown of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first selection box is for the rapid breakdown of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... the sub@@ division is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the No@@ .1 option is for use in articles such as keywords , fu@@ ther notes or references . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; name : this command is identified as a section for a section , a image or other element . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reference : is used for reference to a fixed name ( selection of a selection panel ) .
when using quote there is a selection list with literary in@@ scriptions . for &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file is needed for a project . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; files can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; files can be written by hand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last selection box with the names of the names are used for determining the main text , which can be specified for the main text , mer@@ gers , etc . , are the following fonts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when calling &amp; k@@ ile ; two selection criteria for completion of a new document are written by selecting the document type and cou@@ ching settings . 2 . the document can be written easily by reason of the document .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brackets after the command \ \ &apos; document@@ aries contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the font , which may not be set at the beginning , may also appear in the text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
once the above source code input has to be entered has to be compiled ; the sim@@ pl@@ est way for this is the use of the volume of building or the bu@@ ster quick construction .
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; k@@ ile ; for storing the storage automatically .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strap is a comp@@ iling of the document , should be searched for the logging after the errors . if using quick construction &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece . if this is not the case , the recording should also be considered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an environment ( English environment ) is a text that is treated like the rest of the documents , and only a few south you should begin to create a different font in the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the promotions are supervised only within the area ( from \ \ ) . ( environment } up to \ \ , { environment } ) , there are no fittings within one environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , there are many possibilities to read the read and us@@ ability of the document . these commands can be found either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; \ \ opens { premature ejaculation } : this command is for short print , and is long run until it can be closed with \ \ the { premature ejaculation } or another environment . a single word in a set can be displayed with \ \ receiving { word } . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; \ \ Qu@@ ote : created a quote from the document . the quote starts with \ \ , { Qu@@ ote } and ends with \ \ end { Qu@@ ote } . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after writing the source text with the lat@@ ex ; indic@@ ating language , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once in the assist@@ ants a bit text was entered , a few adjustments were to be done for the better read@@ ability of the document . they should be a quote , a few spots in the fat and c@@ si@@ veness and a graphic poem to use these commands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the document has been viewed , it can be returned to the editor by editor view or Str@@ g E ( for the internal viewer ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a Post@@ Script file . simply try and have fun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
DVI ; is a main file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ ace ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF @-@ conversion or computer screens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for printing a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for creating a document , can then be printed using the document ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tool@@ bar displays the conversion of the DVI ; file in other formats . once the DVI ; file is created from the lat@@ ex ; source code , the conversion into converted other formats can start in the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sum@@ mer@@ time searching for the direct jump from the editor to the respective position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Bin@@ d files . this only needs to set up modern under settings K@@ ile ... tools of building to be balanced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to search for the preferred search , the mouse cursor must be placed in a line of the source text and attached to the appropriate place within the DVI ; viewer simply happens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with one click of the medium mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document of &amp; k@@ ile ; subject to &amp; k@@ ile ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; as text editor you need to set up a text mode ( Editor )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if using quick construction of the &amp; DVI ; viewer can &apos;t be a bug . if an error has been made , it will be displayed in the recording file or the message window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logging file will be used to record the error in the source code . in the editor you can still see the faul@@ ty line of the faul@@ ts . in order to be clicked on the faul@@ ty line , the error must be clicked on in the logging and jumps to the faul@@ ty line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once upon the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to choose from the template used for the document . the default settings are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for selection of empty document a document can be written either , or the assistant to quickly create a new document . more information on this document is included in the section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ Ã ¯ s users of &amp; lat@@ ex , mostly use the same introduction for nearly all documents . templates can be saved in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create a new template , you need to create a new record , or create a new file . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template using existing document and selecting file from document ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when creating a new document , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or sign @-@ encoding ) . these variables can set up and set settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know what strings of which variables are replaced : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ RE@@ SO@@ P@@ TI@@ ON@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by the input in document class . typically they are used as used in document class : \ \ &apos; document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ RE@@ SO@@ P@@ TI@@ ON@@ S $ $ &#93; { items } .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the easiest way to create a template is the use of the assist@@ ants and the associated entry for commands in the editor . once the document has been created , the following steps were executed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when creating a new document , their own template can be selected instead of the standard used standard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files created , a simple way to create a template , should be searched for one in the internet and searched under the steps below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for reading and high@@ lighting of many different types of text files ( among them also &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for Kate . can be made out directly from &amp; k@@ ile ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to learn more about Kate and its ties , the book should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile . you can start reading directly with the editor of &amp; Kate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command@@ line reference which can be called for the help of La@@ Te@@ X reference which can be found in the following commands which can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use can be found as well as their syntax .
a double @-@ click with pressed string button to extract the &amp; tex ; that means that in this way click on \ \ v. \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ .
the selected text will automatically be copied to the clip@@ board at the drag of the text with the left mouse button .
when using the arrow keys with pressed p@@ ush@@ button key parts of the source text in the Edi@@ tor@@ window will be selected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; allows you to browse and empha@@ size the most diverse types of source textiles . for example , the lat@@ ex commands differ from normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ul@@ ae can be highlighted by another colour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many assist@@ ants can come into a text of book@@ marks inside the text . this spr@@ inging stamp shows the jump to the smallest or last spr@@ inging mark . this spr@@ inging stamp is also highlighted automatically with the first input of a character . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; k@@ ile ; although &amp; Kate ; already excellent opportunities for writing ; &amp; lat@@ ex ; special commands for their selection . among editing suites , the following commands are included : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
recur@@ ring a complete paragraph ( group of lines that contain an empty line ) with a paragraph does not include an empty line with the text ; &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source text . this is the only elu@@ sive thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; so that the deposits are separated by two empty lines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; w@@ it the word underneath the current cur@@ ry position . this sel@@ ections also has an extended meaning , since this command is also lat@@ ex ; commands with a high yield ( * ) at the end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to read a part of the document can be removed from this first , and can be removed by dr@@ ink@@ ing@@ . &amp; Kate . the key commands are removed from here to your own commands . under Edit Rem@@ ove the following commands to read the text : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; removed a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile , is contained in the description to edit properties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has already been clari@@ fied that environments a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , offers &amp; k@@ ile ; for further orders placed under edit environment for a m@@ Ã ¶ ent simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this command , the command starts at the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly before the command to run the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this command , at the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to merge the surroundings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the cursor is set before or within the command \ \ , { surroundings } , becomes the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when entering many other environmental orders it can quickly go beyond . this command is close to the last modified environment , so that the superior surrounding structure will not fail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the lat@@ ex , groups , which are determined by cl@@ amps { ... } . among the Edi@@ te@@ X group are some important commands to which from editing environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this command is spec@@ kl@@ ed at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed right outside the preceding box .
this command is bol@@ ted to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed right behind the p@@ enc@@ ased clas@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the cursor is located or behind the slo@@ ped K@@ lam@@ mer of a &amp; tex , group # is the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when entering many ou@@ sted groups of bra@@ ised , groups of par@@ enth@@ eses can quickly be lost . this command is close to the last end@@ owed structure of the &amp; tex ; groups not being destroyed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple steps are used as a type for use . for the purpose used is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &quot; is used for two simple contact characters . &quot; does this case be used for two simple past@@ ures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this automatic set @-@ up of the double bonds can be set up under ile settings ... La@@ Te@@ X to be inserted and off .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are also specific settings ( e.g. , or French ) and with the German or French search characters . there are also many other languages available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the shift of Shift ; inputs &amp; n@@ ile ; a intelligent line crash . if the current position is within a lists environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , only a line of line but also the command \ \ item . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within a tables are close to e@@ mit &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ , with an attached line break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pre@@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom designed environments ; these can be set up in at@@ titudes ; setting up ... La@@ Te@@ X .
some users can arrange the columns in tables and arrange all the E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) and searched for each other ; for the next tab in the displayed tab . although this tab is not the appropriate tab in the current tab .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even though &amp; Kate . already a good source code test , this was installed in &amp; k@@ ile ; in order to set special commands ( mostly for lat@@ ex ; ) all these modes can be set up to set up a different working modes ... Ver@@ sati@@ n are set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when starting a new setting , with the command \ \ \ , { surroundings } will &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { surroundings } following an empty line ( for the text ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you hit the kn@@ u@@ ck@@ bar , the last letter of the input is removed and m@@ Ã ¶ IN , the list can be changed by entering a further letter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are fully removed by selecting a command . alternatively , jumping to these positions is possible and the desired parameters can be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
under Settings c@@ ile ; set up ... mut@@ ile ; All these lists can be made for these lists . you can select different purpose lists for these lists ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as enter belong of the general language used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the command mode is not n@@ Ã ¼ tz@@ el to deal with environments . a large list with \ \ &apos; needs to be entered . on the other hand , the environments become so often used that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for the legacy of the environments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when calling the full @-@ editing environment , the command editing environment or the key space will automatically begin automatically , and will be continued in \ \ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be able to complete the environment in the easiest way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once this is accomplished , the surroundings will automatically be closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile sees that it acts around a lists , is even a first \ \ item command . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
among settings c@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; comprehen@@ sible settings of these lists are made . this mode uses the grant list of the full @-@ process mode for tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; supported custom lists of can be replaced without ile , which can immediately be set up by L@@ ile drawing board . as an example of an excellent drawing list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , for example , is contained in the record L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the letter L is entered and the word tri@@ pled the menu of C@@ tr@@ l + Alt Space key , the letter L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gro@@ unded servants are not helpful for the automatic off@@ ence . however , it has been noted that many W@@ Ã ¶ IN can be written in a document more than once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this mode can set up in to@@ ile settings . here can the sw@@ elling value be switched off . here , the sw@@ elling value for the display of the fully @-@ supported can be set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perfec@@ ting files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ ile / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / or personal mode ( optional ) or tex .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the graphics dialog consists of graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics of the graphic formats , the sections should be considered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PS files are not as known as PDF files , but they provide an excellent basis for revision and new orders . if the PDF file is rela@@ yed and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to realize the result of the work , you have to comp@@ ile the source code . all construction tools are group@@ ed into the spaces of creating comp@@ iling , creating and creating value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the comp@@ iling the source text for the viewer , like the ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the other transformation may be used by Alt ; 4 to the DVI ; file into a PS file and can be viewed using Alt ; 5 the PS file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when using the command clamp , a viewer is usually called upon the comp@@ ile . should no own viewer be used , each will create a new window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new project will be asked for the project New project .... In this case the following information is asked for the project :
when switching to the fil@@ en@@ ame window the relative path from the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file must be specified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the script function of &amp; k@@ ile , allows the exec@@ uting of EC@@ MAS@@ S code . the scripts can be managed in the vertical glue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the API scripts are not yet designed and can be used in other versions of &amp; k@@ ile ; nor yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , it has to be said that the language environment of the scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = k@@ ile ) has the following methods : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite balanced system , in which the basic functions are expanded through a variety of additional packages to assist . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a lot of different aid to supporting the user . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; Electro@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ ex ; are delivered with many documents . they contain a documentation for the contained packages and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only about a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are included ) but rather is a fully supported instructions for a particular form@@ atting . it is therefore ideal for searching for a particular form@@ atting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ideal for searching for a particular form@@ atting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ideal for searching for a particular form@@ atting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the quantity of documents using &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ as ; the application of the correct document is not always easy . as m@@ Ã ¶ IN , the small application of doc@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which includes a database with all to &amp; k@@ ile ; supplied documents and includes a graphical user . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all documents are divided into categories , and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or drums . only the results are displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a double @-@ click with the mouse or the bedding of the space bar , indicate the viewer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&amp; sig is a graphical editor in order to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails ; the signatures in the graphical user interface will create random signatures from a list . this command line interface provides the signatures for external e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; email ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any signature will be read from the signatures of &amp; k@@ sig for random signature . by many signatures , styles and information , you can create diverse and unique e @-@ mails . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for daily signatures , the same signature will be read from the signatures of &amp; k@@ sig for all day . for each day , use different signatures , just as the acci@@ dental signature will create unique e @-@ mails . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N file New . thereby you will have entered your new signature ; in paragraph Sig@@ nat@@ en , save them with C@@ tr@@ l ; S file storage or click on the disk icon Save . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you may create as many signatures , then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; email ; if you use e @-@ mails private or professional , there are always sufficient signatures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to delete a signature , select it first and then remove it in the File or click on the icon with the red cross removal in tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the use of &amp; sig ; is &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.5 necessary . to attach your signature to your e @-@ mails , you need a program like &amp; K@@ Mail , or another program that can insert the Sig@@ nature from the output of a command . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all working stack elements are listed here . the older of the stack entry is the lower the frame number . see the example below .

version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in integration into &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; all these tools use comp@@ ost as surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as sub @-@ publishers . the combination makes it a fast , efficient , complete and productive tool .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone , who worked with the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentation has been known , knows how much it is . let &apos;s put it on a graphical interface ; simply click the icon for the XML processor and ready ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this application is expected to be an index@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder , if index@@ .@@ doc@@ s is located in the proper working folder , and then remove the selection of current work folders and enter the folder in the field of other folders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted every time when my pro@@ c is started .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as already said , anyone who at the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentation have been worked , white how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , there &apos;s a great graphical interface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the straight file is index@@ .@@ doc@@ book , then they simply leave the current working folder . if not , then select the current work folder and enter the folder where index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is to be found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it comes to a output on the screen , your file is incorrect . please check the reported errors and try again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the file is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , then you can delete the current file easily . if not , delete it with current file the tick and choose the file using another file - file selection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you only want to know if the well @-@ fiel@@ d@@ st file is well , click the Well @-@ tag selection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for use of a &amp; DT@@ D ; that is specified in the &amp; XML ; ( external ) ; otherwise select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; by definition @-@ UR@@ I ; for defin@@ ing the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection is required .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; application tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should the file be selected in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , then they can be selected , then remove the current file and select the selected file by using the other file selection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter the name of the file , as the result is supposed to be named normally in your home folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plug@@ ins called the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; possibly have little to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even if the plug @-@ in system is very powerful . you can &apos;t wait until someone can use it in a large number of &amp; GUI ; -@@ elements can be found further below .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to install a plug @-@ in or a K@@ Part , we begin with the menu plug@@ ins . this will open the following dialog : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this dialog allows to ad@@ minister all of the plug@@ ins to ad@@ minister and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a storage place &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to searching the plug@@ ins .
many people work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties link .
the name and email entries are self explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and is used for unique identi@@ fying .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders as well as Sub@@ project manager . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the user can look for himself from the list of team members who he is . this is when he expresses the team member from the list and the S@@ etz@@ e button appears . the currently selected member is bold after you are : text .
nick@@ name and identity of their identity are important in terms of messages and notes . see for further information on tex@@ tual notes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the overview of your team , there is another benefit from the capture members of the team : it may be an event to create the team manager if something happens . see for more information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event actions are actions that are executed when something certain occurs in the project . one example would be able to record the opening and closing of the project , or send a script to get a file into CVS by sending a file as soon as they are added to the project &amp; etc ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the event configuration configuration , F@@ 7 project Project Properties dialog will be created , edited and deleted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ see in the receiver list . addressing can be a team or sub @-@ project manager . see in , wei such ladder will be set up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
notes are special comments in documents . they differ from ordinary comments by the following things :
notes to enter is simple . it may be chosen either the note record from the editor context or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment area followed by note text .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; notes can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case , the project manager @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( Role ) is part of the project manager for the enrich@@ ing and sub @-@ project names , as shown in the examples below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nick@@ name and roll @-@ names are independent of big or small numbers , but spaces surrounding the cl@@ amps and the : make the note invalid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scripts and form@@ atting languages that DT@@ D @-@ disease is supported and web @-@ based form@@ atting and scrip@@ ting languages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings are reachable via the settings menu . here are only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings , a short description for the others can be found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings can be set up by setting Qu@@ anta R@@ anta ... This dialog extends over some pages , which will be treated after each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in terms of tags including car completion may be changed .
big / lower@@ case of tags : big / lower@@ case of automatic tags . normal big / minor numbers added to the tags are added as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
big / lower@@ case of attributes : big / lower@@ case of automatically added attributes . normal big / lower@@ case means the attributes are added as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; optional tags automatically include : if requested , is optional for tags , for which tag is optionally available , added immediately after &amp; gt ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automatically include optional tags : as above , for all other tags with the exception of simple tags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automatically update - and closing tag automatically : if enabled , the respective tag is changed and vice versa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
automatic detection of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ent characters in the corresponding encoding during night@@ fall .
M@@ IM@@ E types : facial types for detection of different types of files . using the standard set @-@ up can be restored to standard prescri@@ ptions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; standard encoding : the coding of new or altered files ( where the encoding of the file can be merged ) , but this setting is sent out by the same in project properties if a project is loaded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not detected . this setting is specified by the same in project characteristics , if a project is loaded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; generates regular backup copies , so that during the next start of the program the document can be restored to the file . this is not the same as saving the file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editing area or an own view ( or documentation in one box ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and source code at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; set the window settings back to the next start is useful when the user interface has come through changing the MDI mode and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views through to other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the warning messages range will be used to control war@@ nings if you want to display war@@ nings by means of no more questions .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can change the display of icons instead of scripts and the source code file in the file specified mode .
here the par@@ ser and the structural tree that represents the figure of Par@@ ser @-@ node in the document will be set in detail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the range mouse click on the structural tree , the following action is possible to change the action by clicking the structure tree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the structural tree settings the visibility of no@@ des in tree can be adjusted to the tree and how deep with a change in the structure tree can be adjusted automatically . empty knots are the empty areas of the text when empty groups have been found in which the current document has been found .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the area to set short@@ cuts ( a kind of templates ) which can be un@@ folded in groups , each can be valid for several &amp; DT@@ EP . abbrevi@@ ation are valid for several &amp; DT@@ EP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plug@@ ins can be managed here . plug@@ ins are a part applications from third side , which can be used by any part @-@ capable application , on the most known &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
address : the path to the plug@@ in when it is not located at a location like $ K@@ D@@ ED@@ IR / lib .
input : this information is sent to the plug @-@ in when you start the plug @-@ in ( the path of the current file ) or the project folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; component to load in &quot; Only @-@ reading &quot; mode : check , whether the plug@@ in ref@@ uses the charging . only @-@ reading @-@ k@@ parts normally refuse to load when this option is not selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
check the plug@@ in : if the plug@@ in is enabled and then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the plug@@ in is not available when the plug@@ in is not available yet , but it should be installed later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , the bug@@ ging was built completely new . no more support for the d@@ b@@ g de@@ bug@@ ger . instead , a de@@ bug@@ ger plug @-@ in concept was implemented that allows different implement@@ ations of plug@@ ins enabled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently only a plug@@ in is available that support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; add .
the use of a de@@ bug@@ ger for a project begins with the selection of an appropriate de@@ bug@@ ger plug@@ in to the project settings . using the options next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plug @-@ in box the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bug@@ ger is enabled for a project there will be some additional items in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; user interface :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a view , displayed in the contents of super@@ awak@@ ened variables , is normally in the left dock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a view , listed above all holding points , listed with line numbers and conditions . usually appears in the lower dock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a view , shown in the display ( like in HTML ) of the de@@ bug@@ gers will normally be in the lower dock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bug@@ gers , everything is available or part of the following functionality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this action will make the connection to de@@ bug@@ ger , if necessary , or it spl@@ its the plug @-@ in when a project is opened to de@@ bug@@ ger that normally does not have to be considered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the counter@@ part of Deb@@ ug@@ gen session starts session . includes the connection to de@@ bug@@ ger , or termin@@ ates the listening to requirements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; send an HTTP request to the server to in@@ duce a de@@ bug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser , to display the current document . this requirement is displayed in the display of de@@ bug@@ ger output . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indicates the de@@ bug@@ ger to begin with the execution of the script and to send information on the passed variables , as well as the current out@@ lined line , the execution will start , starting with the requirement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the script starts , the script will start with the requirement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indicates the de@@ bug@@ ger to begin with the execution of the script , without inform@@ ing variables and the current Z@@ eil@@ ing number . if this happens , the execution proceeds as soon as a requirement is asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the de@@ bug@@ ger leads the next command in the script without entering the functions or include files .
de@@ bug@@ ger leads the next command in the script and when possible in functions and include error .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shows the de@@ bug@@ ger , to pass the statement and go to the next so , there would be no current . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered , the monitored value is to be monitored in the vari@@ ability view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this chapter describes how to adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to suit your needs , and how to help you &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; help to get better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
document type Edi@@ ting packages ( DT@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to provide support for brand and scrip@@ ting languages ; their simplicity and flexibility make out of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , easy @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developer , easy to use and productive .
&amp; DT@@ EP ; s is available in two types of family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 ; the script language and tool@@ bar . day folder contain two types of file names and tool@@ bars . day files containing two types of picture buttons ( above the editing window ) to insert text and instructions faster into a document as a user could ever .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; DT@@ EP ; s can be suspended separately ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created using an existing DT@@ D . see details for conversion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , a &amp; DT@@ EP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) defines the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the properties dialog box ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; DT@@ EP ; even . tool@@ bars provide a rapid inser@@ tion of tags in a document without any risk of writing .
tag folder are nothing but folders . they contain only the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder hold the name of the description language and version so present . ( for example ht@@ ml @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML , if they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible for a better insight and more information in working with them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following chapter describes every element in detail . everything about possibilities and limitations is presented in a simple way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the root element of an tag@@ XML document . it can contain only once in one document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains as only element type over itself else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tags type is a script function . when using , it gets ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only valid for the day type . the name of the basic class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for Type Method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs to . ( only family 2 )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if yes , the day has a common attribute board and attributes to this tags may be added to each other day . ( family 1 ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sets a text in the dialog box . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ Tag . that &apos;s an element type element .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; describing an attribute of a tags . this element can only appear once for each attribute . additionally , it sets the name and type of the attribute . additionally , it contains further tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed , and so is this element type element . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
speci@@ fying the source codes used for the attributes in tag editor and in the attribute tree to
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface is within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to at@@ tain the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method@@ ological name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us is used to at@@ tain the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p as a cut @-@ up and a method name . the arguments that can be passed to the method . can be empty or % di@@ sur@@ name % that means the name of the current tags .
a container day that group@@ ed together the elements of a list . it can only occur once for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speci@@ fies the position of the attribute text of a tags in a dialog box . this tag allows for every attribute to a dialog only once ( e.g. once for each eu@@ lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the position and size of a field in the dialog . this day should be available for each field in the dialog . ( e.g. one for each box ; att@@ r &gt; and lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indicates a list of elements that may be found within the specified tags , this element is an element type only . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indicates a list of elements that one day is ending , this element is an element type only . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; -@@ declar@@ ations : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly filled and closed .
spaces influence anything but watch out &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; ; &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; sub@@ mer@@ sion can cause no leg failure but some pieces of work would disappear .
for checking the Tag@@ XML files the tools dialog on the top in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; window to start and checking day X@@ ML@@ A . another dialog will appear to follow the simple instructions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this function is currently not available yet . currently , the check takes place only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following example , an example for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for these Tag@@ XML file should be sch@@ em@@ a.@@ tag . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following example , an example for a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP is described . the file name of this Tag@@ XML file will be over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .@@ day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &apos; 1.0 &apos; encoding = &apos; UTF @-@ 8 &apos; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; Day name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is as fairly simple and there is a editor for it available via DT@@ D it can edit DT@@ D settings . for a re @-@ set &amp; DT@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; should be created with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = U@@ de 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; version &amp; lt ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Tran@@ si@@ tional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.0@@ 1 Tran@@ si@@ tional ) .
a action can set with settings ... created . click New action leading to the same dialog :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this action is assigned to this action . with clicking on the custom button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ einer the current short@@ cut can be removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the easiest actions . it can input a text in the detailed settings and in execution of the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the most powerful hit type . with the help of this action you can change external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not restricted ) that change the document or use them ( or parts of the document ) or the various See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ EPs .
first you have to specify the name of the script and interpre@@ ter . example : S@@ H / home / my@@ up@@ t.@@ sh .
although skilled pile is permitted , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line : $ K@@ D@@ ED@@ IR / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ K@@ D@@ ED@@ IR / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts can be used in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in the case of a local document it will be removed : / from the document name .
% pi@@ d : will be replaced with PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance is running when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control the PID number ; this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; by the external script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; parameters for this event , normally the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or path to project file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the above mentioned methods , a script input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us can be received by default . in the selection input can be specified , which is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
selected text : the selected section of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only meaningful with this setting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to input can also be re@@ directed to the output of the issued application . there are two types of output , written to the standard output ; error messages are to be submitted to the default output , by default output output : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to sub@@ divide the tags in logical group@@ s. it is not too many , therefore you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the parts of this window are rather self explan@@ atory . press the New Action Kn@@ op@@ fes at the bottom end of the window , picking the editing mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fill in all the necessary fields and add them to the suitable tool@@ bar tag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete all and if the tag has attributes and you are planning its use , enable dialog &quot; to edit &quot; when available , so that a input when using the action is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is this a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? then we replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create a symbol that the action represents better , we are &amp; k@@ ic@@ on@@ edit ; select from the &amp; k@@ menu ; , graphic Other Programs ( or anywhere else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ ic@@ on@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels . but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this . select Edit size .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the promotion does , but also all other users of the &amp; DT@@ EP ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the day start , I decided to create a Start button as a symbol , or should at least be interpreted as a symbol , or at least , a message to the user will be interpreted ; -@@ day in current document is to be indicated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the creation of the symbol it is still to be connected to the promotion . this is done via the menu with settings ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selection of the desired action . in addition to the text field is a button to press him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the folder where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; press the application button and continue with other tags , so it &apos;s still there , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suppose you want to add some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; functions to tool@@ bar , or it should adjust it to better overview through some divi@@ den@@ ds in several groups . make sure the tool@@ bar is selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to choose the Tren@@ ner ( top left ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting it , press the arrow keys to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , I want a quick option to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
please note how the separ@@ ators support the group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar might believe that the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or might believe the opposite of the Start @-@ Kn@@ op@@ sy .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by analy@@ sing all symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure in the right folder , after Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , but your tool@@ bar ( n ) should be saved in the correct folder , so that your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be loaded in the correct folder ( s ) if a file is opened by the corresponding type . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the most not@@ e@@ worthy extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the opportunity to add documentation for scrip@@ ting language or form@@ atting language that you prefer to use a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation you could check out the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory if somebody has done it for you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ atting of the script / etc . , then you have to let the doc@@ r@@ c file . we will have to treat the second part here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = Sec@@ a &#93; relative to this file for example ph@@ p@@ 42 / # Sec@@ 2.@@ 2@@ ht@@ ml = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ ht@@ ml tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 2.@@ ht@@ ml tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ ht@@ ml tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ ht@@ ml
the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for instance you see in the &amp; PHP documentation ; documentation so special :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level Elements Top Element = index@@ .@@ ht@@ ml G@@ etting Event = Basic Reference = Basic Reference = Basic Reference = Basic Reference = Basic Reference = Basic Stat@@ .@@ ht@@ ml ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note the # before G@@ etting and compiled User Reference . this indicates that there are sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content , but there is no known limit for the pit ( except the reason ) m@@ das@@ h ; but try it yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequ@@ ent@@ ally at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ das@@ h ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces influence anything but watch out &amp; lt ; notes . these should be replaced by &amp; by ; &amp; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; Res@@ our@@ c@@ end@@ at@@ files be replaced .
the summar@@ ised section is the section of the doc@@ s _ fet@@ ch _ array functions . for example when writing a &amp; PHP file the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file binding list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a simple list of separate text elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now you can easily save your file doc@@ r@@ c and then write to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc / Qu@@ anta / doc / Que@@ r@@ c . then create a folder like doc@@ s in your file doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation to there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are confident that these are good and well worth being shared , please send your doc@@ s files to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory , for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory , are not being worked with the best web development platform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the separ@@ ating resources ( DT@@ EP packages , tool@@ bars ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or otherwise by sending e @-@ mail , according to DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( DT@@ EP ) with email , tool@@ bar code menu and folder files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , where all the other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ users can download them . in order to make a full contribution , the origin of resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for later users . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when up@@ loading you are asked for their private GP@@ G key ( the Pas@@ sph@@ ra@@ se is not saved ) or in the case you can cancel the input fields ( URL preview can remain empty ) and start clicking OK the up@@ loading .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up@@ loading the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( DT@@ EP ) , the tool@@ bar can be up@@ loading , and in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts can be started . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after downloading a resource , before installation , exam@@ ines &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . in case of problems war@@ ns it and it can be canc@@ eled . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , then a message appears with the specification of the Author of resource . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is possible to work in XML languages , which is currently not yet supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it can be more time to work by converting a DT@@ D file into an DT@@ EP package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D Download and Con@@ vert a DT@@ D . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description which should be used . afterwards the following dialogue will appear :
objective name : the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qui@@ st@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type definition line : the string to appear in ! doc@@ type tag such as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC - / / W3@@ C HTML 4.0@@ 1 Tran@@ si@@ tional / / EN htt@@ p / / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d
fine adjustment of DT@@ EP within the conversion : when activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after conversion the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ Editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this option .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , there are some key concepts . to understand these concepts and to be familiar with these fundamental concepts , one must first bring them to these concepts without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; little use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this enables the group of administr@@ ators of various tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which can then be used in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
local elements provide a personal collection of web development equipment for a single user . these are custom designs and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory where they can only use this user personally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project @-@ related elements are only available within a certain project . simply said , this is the most limited size especially for the files of a specific project . all elements are displayed in the folder tree of the project , which means the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ MDI ; consists of some main areas : the editing pane , the designs , the cart@@ ons with information and the tool@@ bars . please beat in , and for further information about these areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can click the boxes with the right mouse button to re@@ load up a text menu with the current doctrine , delete , delete , or upload the document , to create a bookmark or version from CVS commands to the current document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create another context menu in the editor , editing and copy / paste , editing the text under the mouse cursor , or open the file , if the string under the mouse cursor is called a file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the top end of the Edi@@ tor@@ n@@ enst@@ ock , the tool@@ bars of the Edi@@ tors . presently includes &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.0@@ 1 Tran@@ si@@ tional . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the tool@@ bars are adapted to new functions and thus associated user requirements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if they want to insert a tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; if you want to insert the data for this just one day . if you want to insert several attributes ( as Anker ) , you can fill in a dialog box of different fields . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the construction ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate to the information on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navigate them to open and through them . in the presentation with boxes , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation terms are available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project using legal mouse click . promotions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from the storage medium can then be performed using the displayed Download menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another option of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be one template : pictures , program parts , a whole web site , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which they are used in which link them . global templates are available only for the relevant users and templates in projects . more on templates can be found in the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . by clicking on the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information for a script . by clicking on the right mouse button you can start to edit or send the script . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this view , one indicates the internal structure of the active document . by the right click of an element , the cursor is set to the position of an element in relation to navigation and refresh@@ ment of the tree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this tree appears amongst others . it can change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ ace with it . the contents of any available attributes can be changed with a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation for Web @-@ technology for your development . it can create pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you can create your own documentation and can be edited and considered by adding a folder doc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two boxes at the bottom of the window , can be achieved via the useful information window and the problem window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this anti@@ lever displays information about any script running in Qu@@ anta , such as the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes of DT@@ D . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this case displays all mistakes in the Mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; scripts that are executed and indicate all error messages ( so it gives ) in this window .
die &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a icon and get the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bars is the opportunity to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar to mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if they receive a tool@@ bar in an email , they can secure and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any other .
it is reasonable if you want to change the place of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ files on your system . to get a complete list of options available to configure the configure script . / configure --@@ help . / configure --@@ help file and not executed here .
if you have problems when starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us you should check if your path contains the &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 bin folders . you should also make sure that no older version of &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 in PAT@@ H before your bin folders .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a Web development tool optimized for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor would build the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; well , this would make him absolutely wid@@ est Web development tool for &amp; K@@ DE ; so it was done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . then you can define &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for that the appropriate &amp; IDE can be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , to the above claim must be stated that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; K@@ DE ; designed , in good use of free software ; it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to expand how they need it for their needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; enables Web@@ designers to improve the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( MDI ; ) . this can enhance productivity . by self @-@ deleted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars . by self @-@ kn@@ it@@ ching actions you need to mem@@ ori@@ ze them . ( read more about it . )
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment designed for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for fast web development and quickly developed to a sophisticated editor with many powerful features .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GPL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in the details of this documentation is help with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter or use / help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently developed and cared for by Eric L@@ aff@@ è sequence @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a quick @-@ to @-@ file list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time when you open a file , which is not being taken out of the oldest entry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this allows you to save code parts and all files as templates for later use . in the section above templates , you should try to save the selected file / text out of the local / project privileges , will only write an error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; converted to insert from the clip@@ board , the special characters contained on &amp; HTML ; em@@ itting , so that they can be displayed correctly and cannot be understood by the browser as a form@@ atting device . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
converts the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; exp@@ elling which the correct way for inser@@ ting special characters and space characters in &amp; URL ; s . primarily used for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s it is used in the Anker tag .
switches the block selection or off . this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift ; key .
go directly to a line number . that &apos;s very helpful when your &amp; PHP ; script error messages available !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined phra@@ ses to help you .
displays the window window or not . that is the window in which you can see the display of scripts and de@@ bug@@ gers .
output and switching of the problem valve at the bottom edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem is activated when you alter@@ n@@ ates to the structural tree .
displays the tool@@ bars on the left of the main window . this column allows you to bookmark outlines with a mouse click .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu with entries or next , depending on the position of the cursor in the document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu by the fil@@ en@@ ame of other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects are stored with the .@@ web@@ pr@@ j file .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presented a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this enables you to copy video files into your project folder or a sub@@ folder and then add it to the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; K@@ DE , and if you have downloaded further input / output modules ( Ki@@ o slaves ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
settings such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project is managed . chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects will be explained in the details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loads a project tool . these are kept in projec@@ tions / tool@@ bars , and are only in this menu , if you have assigned it to this project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the tool@@ bar type , local or project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this will create only the name . actions must be saved by means of tool@@ bars , or you will be asked when ordering , whether you want to save the tool@@ bars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; removes a tool@@ bar from the sight area . this del@@ etes them not from the hard disk . if you have not saved the tool@@ bar , you will be asked if you would like to do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , you can send your own tool bar to someone ( maybe on the tool@@ bar ) . the menu item opens a new E@@ Mail message with the tool@@ bar as an attachment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
allows up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server where any other you can access it . see in .
download a &amp; DT@@ D ; you or anybody else has made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description .
charging / striking out of the En@@ ti@@ ties of the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense when the entities are out of the &amp; DT@@ EP . if this globally is not present and write permission in the global K@@ DE folder fails to re @-@ charge the load .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this menu includes a list of tags , which are currently loaded in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is a sub@@ menu standard , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
allows access to the current tag dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags . followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menu .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the smart insert of tags . currently this works only with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . intelligent insert means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us is ref@@ uses by adding a tool@@ bar if this day does not contradi@@ ct the rules .
the plug@@ ins menu available in the plug@@ ins menu are listed below the menu options listed above . click on the activated plug@@ ins enabled .
choose the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting sch@@ em@@ ata depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; -@@ version .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choose the type of line analysis . very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop , select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; by external application Ti@@ dy .
immediate switching between the different types of user interface . due to some restrictions in the K@@ DE libraries the switch is sometimes need or in@@ beautiful graphics . recommended is the default setting mode or the sub@@ window mode which corresponds to the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , this menu includes an entry for every open sub@@ window . the corresponding sub@@ window will be enabled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
switch the display of the stat@@ us@@ bar at the bottom edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changes in this dialog will influence any application which will use the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; Kate . you will find details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a dialog does not appear in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bars , or add them in row . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this should not be implemented in accordance with the area of the mouse @-@ line but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely licensed . if you want to use the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form you will find here the way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fields are self explan@@ atory and should be completed most from top to bottom , since all these paths and author information fields can be completed automatically with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , the file is completed automatically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ project file . by default she has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces to be web@@ j@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j . this file is stored in the project directory .
here is a server address of the machine to which one wants to access the local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ Ex@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you leave this field empty , the default protocol setting will be necessary , depending on the remote computer &apos;s setup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path used for project and default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem to the project . there can be multiple files or folders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this setting is great , if you have static we@@ bin@@ ations which you want to download and change . with server script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project are supposed to be included , if a project is re@@ started from scratch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this option , all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make a precise range looking for credit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder , you can select the desired files by clicking or remove the desired files from the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last screen of the new project wiz@@ ard contains three settings that can simplify your work . these settings can be updated in the menu with Project Properties in the menu pane or with the Shift Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project wiz@@ ard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholder is possible ) which can be re@@ used in project @-@ related operations such as project folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the additional option , files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ or are excluded from the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project view that will be loaded when opening the project . in this case more about project views can be found .
this allows the de@@ bug@@ ger to be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be configured . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plug @-@ in can be configured with the Options button . in this trouble you find troub@@ les@@ hooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the sub@@ window profiles , up@@ loading profiles ( see in ) can be configured as well as the display of a tree view for each profile , showing a separate design visibility for each profile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see details . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the sub@@ window event configuration , one can turn out event actions and modify them , modify or delete any event actions , as if you have previously specified event , such as the f@@ use of a file . see details . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us opens ; the last project which was opened . this behavior is not currently able to influence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to open a different project , select Open Project ... Open Project File or the Symbol project from the tool@@ bar . the dialog window will display and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us is closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . changed files . the same happens if you load a new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the project man@@ ners are free access to the files in the project , where the files can be managed in the current project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as well , the entries are missing , however , the entries are missing and open to ... with the right mouse button on the right click menu : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
different profiles can be chosen here . the profile contains information on the site of the uploaded files . see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; allows removing the current profile . if only a profile is present , the button is suspended to prevent removal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; keep your password in the core memory , and the password is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and that does not save any unused password on disk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialogue , if you change your opinion before up@@ loading . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , many high loading profiles are created and so that the project ( or parts of the project ) are uploaded to various servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog will be displayed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the server name to be copied onto the files . either a fully qualified domain name , or IP address work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and the installed Ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and NFS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the port for the transfer . normally this does not have to be changed , unless the network administrator runs a service on the usual port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on your anxiety shaft , this is either a time saving function or a risk . use it to be saved on the plate , so it can not be easily read , but each with programming knowledge can easily be seen in plain text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a project view is only one set files and tool@@ bars . it can be loaded into a project many views , i.e. by simple do@@ cking the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; views can be saved in the Project or Project @-@ tool@@ bar , at@@ tain@@ able about tool@@ bars tool@@ bar , open or deleted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; with which one has to do most . this will not only increase the productivity but also permits the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , to your own work@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as mentioned above , tool@@ bars can be stacked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; best deals with tool@@ bars . adding , tool@@ bars is handled in the section Add by tool@@ bars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tool@@ bars and symbols can be set to create a tool@@ bar in which with new action , tool tool@@ bars , or tool@@ bars , can be implemented in which actions can be displayed in the dialog where can be displayed on this or other tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will eventually remove and processed action which are self explan@@ atory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can set up with settings , and set settings again in the menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; templates are listed in the essential document skel@@ et@@ ons , code @-@ schn@@ apps and files to link . templates have a usual file system with advanced organisation and interfaces . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the constra@@ ints which you imagine to the file system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provided templates have conditions for their application . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template .
binary is everything that is not pure text . it can be inserted every file except text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; binary format . some examples are found in the Display tree on global templates . further information on templates are available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; documents may be created by any text document . based on this templates , new documents can be created . usually they can be found in appropriate sub@@ folders to be efficient . some examples may be found under global templates . see for more information on templates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document will be added based on a template but the same text area on Javascript or Perl basis . some examples are available in the template tree on JavaScript or Perl . see examples for more information on templates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the name says , these templates are used for all websites as templates . you are a collection of different documents that can be organized in a folder structure , there are currently no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; create a documentation structure according to your choice ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As a local template .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as soon as this is done you are not@@ icing that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . check out the template in the projec@@ ting tree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select text in your document , and click on file as a template save selection as local / project templates . alternatively , the selection can be simply drawn with pulling and deposit onto the tree view template . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file is only used in a template folder . it can only use all file management functions instead of pulling and insert or inser@@ tion over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can click in the file tree or in the project files to create a folder for the template , and secure a name for the template . by default , it can be saved as local or global model . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project templates allow a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can create header or dynamically with &amp; PHP , create files or link them with them . additionally , you can link up some things when using templates in projects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files used in $ K@@ D@@ ED@@ IR / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / Templ@@ ates / Qu@@ anta / Qu@@ anta / Qu@@ anta / Qu@@ anta / Qu@@ anta / Qu@@ anta / Qu@@ anta / Qu@@ anta / Qu@@ anta / Qu@@ anta / Qu@@ anta / Qu@@ anta / Qu@@ anta / Qu@@ anta / template .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to determine the behaviour of a folder , the right mouse button on the folder click to click on the folder and select the following dialog box : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a selection box with the three previously described ones ; files , text or templates . this selection is dropped , as soon as el@@ ter@@ nal attributes is attached . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is enabled by default and adap@@ ts for anything except the stem cells in the template , unless otherwise it would be explicitly activated . in case of a normal folder , the bla@@ h would appear with something like lyrics inside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
allows a set @-@ up or re@@ line text for templates in this folder . this could be a general header or foot@@ er for all templates in a folder with special header / foot@@ ers a whole presentation already with the matching head@@ lines / foot@@ er lines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , using the context menu ( to indicate right mouse button ) through a complete command collection for adding folders or copy files from one place to another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provides two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source code editor displays the source code editor in two parts : the editor and the V@@ PL editor window .
the V@@ PL file ; Editor works as follows : he re@@ charges a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - oder N@@ X@@ HTML ; - page and one cursor appears . then you can edit and transfer the changes listed in the V@@ PL ; editor in the sourc@@ ec@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document that contains &amp; PHP ; -@@ source code , it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . there is no plans to change these behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second mode is just like the first , except for the changes in the source code editor and V@@ PL ; editor at the same time , the cursor is switched from one window to another , whereby the position is kept in the document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the synchronization distance between the V@@ PL and editor and the source code editor is adjustable from synchron@@ isation after one click or automatically . during selection , it can automatically select the time period . basically , the recommendation can be set for fast computers and a large range for slow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suppose I will change the title of the website , so it is possible to select the documentation of the web page with the V@@ PL ; editor . this is how a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document themselves i.e. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons ( e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the contents ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CSS rules are the new way to add or delete pages in the browser . you can add a change on the list , just like in the met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is possible to include a external CSS style template by pressing the file and select the appropriate file .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of the cursor is possible like in a word processing , by moving with the arrows as usual . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and deleted by using R@@ AC@@ C@@ KT@@ AS@@ TE or distances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inser@@ ting tags is done in the same manner as in the source code editor , as in the source code editor . it is not removed if a anchor tag is inserted with text , every other ambient drop has to be removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some tool@@ bars like the tables wiz@@ ard or the lists wiz@@ ard are disabled . you will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists of tool@@ bars must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for exam@@ ining style sheets . in contrast to other programs , search for specific elements is possible and the style of style can be tra@@ cked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully comp@@ iling , need except &amp; K@@ DE ; nor lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already existing at a typical installation of &amp; K@@ DE . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hold in a template in one of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g loaded silent or x@@ ml file or at the current node . new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode can be set and activated later in a specified file and line number .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the complete path from a fil@@ en@@ ame for fil@@ en@@ ames . fil@@ en@@ ame files with rela@@ tional path to the work@@ file con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g Is available for example a styl@@ istic file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l if the following input is possible :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this command , a partial or entire agreement with a pre@@ age named QNA@@ ME , or a specified method name is checked . &amp; eg ; template matches the string template . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
each name space in the given name &quot; QNAP &quot; is expanded according to the rules which is specified by the X@@ SL source file defined by the X@@ SL : test@@ 1 and extended ; extended to htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a fixed mounting point must be dissolved for the associated UR@@ I and Z@@ eil@@ ing number . this is automatically re@@ done when loading the first template through x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . holding points are soon re@@ confirmed after the start of each flow .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the assembly was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ing had changed many changes , and at the same time a further programmer had changed . a further programmer had changed much text in the same file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the program used by me only showed me the modified lines , but I couldn &apos;t see what exactly had changed within these lines . and there was no indications regarding the places , where perhaps this changes had been a little night@@ mare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; Co diff@@ 3 ; might cause differences in one line and changes to white characters . later , lots of more useful functions were added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , if you want to compare quick text easily , copy it into the clip@@ board and add it in one of the comparison windows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a function that made a lot of work was the same and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; re@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a fully @-@ cast file browser . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
3 @-@ way mer@@ ging will also be fully supported . this is useful if two persons are working independently from each other on a piece of co@@ de and make changes at the same time . the display photo shows three source files at the same time . the screen picture shows three source files when mer@@ ging it :
&amp; diff@@ user 3 ; also helps you to merge and merge the complete folder . this screenshot shows &amp; diff@@ use the folder merge :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; diff@@ use the exact differences and how to turn the possibilities of color monitors . if you frequently have to check the code , you will like this function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; differences in white characters and tab@@ s are displayed visible , if only in a certain number of white characters you can see this at a glance at the column on the left . ( no more trouble when somebody alter@@ nat@@ or changes . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if one file is equal , and the other differs in one line , then displays color to which file is different . red color means that both files differ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can easily edit the file work by using only the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opening dialog allows the manual typ@@ ing of file names , select the selection above the file @-@ browser ( file ... ) or selecting an recently opened file . you don &apos;t have to leave any third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis is done with two files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the button folders ... you can also select a folder , if you select a folder , then use the same or merge folders , if you select a file then use &amp; diff@@ use the file name from A in the two other folders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if mer@@ ging is enabled , the input field is active and it is not necessary to set up an output file . you can do this step later when saving . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entry button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start with the same / mer@@ ging .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . the comparison will start automatically . in opening dialog box you don &apos;t need to select any files , you simply can close the dialog with the cancel button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also use pulling and insert it , simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from a editor and let it fall via a comparison window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what idea is there ? sometimes contains a file for example multiple functions . if you would like to figure out the relevant files , you would need to copy them in &amp; diff@@ use them . now you can simply copy , paste and compare these relevant files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Not@@ at@@ ka : currently you can remove anything from &amp; diff@@ user ; only the case of text in a comparison list is supported .
warning : some editors interpre@@ t the pulling and insert text into another program as selecting and inser@@ tion ( instead of copying and inser@@ tion ) . in such cases your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text window is the info line . the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . then a small auxiliary window will display the complete name . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three spring windows are assigned the characters A , B and C . A has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pre@@ ferences are changed via the Settings menu . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a difference is detected , the color scheme is different . ( color for conflicts in settings ) is especially useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( mer@@ ging ) well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the left next to the text there is the column column . when differences were found , the column displays the corresponding colour . in some programming languages , white characters will be shown . in some programming languages , white characters are only important in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare isolated cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vertical line , which separates the summary column from the text , is interrupted at places where the respective source file is no lines . if the line break is checked , the line is shown on broken lines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result window ( under the comparison windows ) also has a Info line with the inscription edition : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; ge@@ Change &#93; . usually , it contains text , but often it contains conflicts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts has gone down is saving disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons to next dissolved / un@@ solved conflict which is still to be found in remaining conflicts . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only two compar@@ ators are used , each difference is also a conflict which has to be solved manually . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group is shown in all windows and the first row is displayed in the windows , where the group is highlighted with color background color for current area and on the left , a black beam appears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , through the automatic merge operation or by manual processing there will be no more line in the query ; no line in the query tab . this text appears neither in the final stored file , nor in a mark which you may copy and insert elsewhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the text &amp; lt ; cont@@ oc@@ ating conflict ; however , appears in the clip@@ board , if you copy this text from the result window . carefully go with this function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : if when selecting the sources , choose the options numbers or ignore or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments will also be treated as white characters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; navigate mainly to the thumb@@ nails and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are used in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys in the beginning , end , Str@@ g @-@ beginning and C@@ tr@@ l @-@ end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the mode window , you can also use the other keys to edit . with the insert button you can switch between insert and write mode . ( default is the plug mode . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summar@@ ize columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as described in the section ) and the edi@@ table window indicator was explained ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons to navigation use the current / first difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ image / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ top ) , to the next / previous difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ image upward ) or to the next / previous conflict . therefore , between sol@@ der and un@@ resolved conflicts has to be distinguished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to copy the marking in the clip@@ board , you need to copy the copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l @-@ In@@ sert ) . if this option is advisable to automatically copy to the clip@@ board and will be incorrect , because you could acci@@ dentally copy the contents of the clip@@ board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
line frames are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix versions do not use line inser@@ tion characters \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use the line @-@ up of the source files . therefore you should use &amp; cau@@ d@@ 3 ; also do not use bin@@ aries files .
the options and list of the last used files will be automatically saved at the end and restore the next start . ( Menu Adju@@ st@@ ment &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ( ... )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choose a font with a fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog will also indicate writings with variable width to choose from , but you should not use it . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you activate this option , differences in itali@@ c writings are displayed . if the selected scripture cannot be supported , nothing happens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would automatically be illustrated . at these systems , the button is automatically rele@@ asing the default color . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this option is enabled , the tab character will be inserted into space by pressing the tab . otherwise a tab character will be inserted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when entering or press Return , the next row will be automatically used for the next row . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this option is enabled , each selection is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . then copy the manual to the clip@@ board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can select which line type you prefer to store . the default value is the generally usual selection of the used operating system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , white characters will be ignored in the source files . only during this first step , white characters may be ignored . in this stage white characters will not be ignored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some editors ( on some systems ) store a carriage returns &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , but then files can be displayed with different sizes in page @-@ to @-@ page comparison . during mer@@ ging this option must be disabled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in default , this option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis figures and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; ) are displayed yet , but they are treated as white characters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this option is de@@ activated in the pre@@ set . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inten@@ sively , looking for smaller sub@@ divide . the option is in default . it is effective for complex and large files , but slowly in very large files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in automatic skip mode this setting is determined , as long as the result of the selection is displayed , before the next un@@ solved conflict will continue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; release automatic all conflicts in white characters by choosing the selected file as a source . ( default ) , use the features of voters in numbers or comments if the options are able to ignore or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments are activated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these options are discussed in the chapter for scanning folders and exec@@ uting a merge . check out details under documentation , comparison , and merge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a file is stored and already an older version exists , then the original version is attached to the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ stock . if already such a backup file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ stock , it will be cleared without further backup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adap@@ ting the interface language . changing this option does not affect the current running program . you need to stop and restart the change , so that the change is active over the control centre in the K@@ DE version of &amp; Co diff@@ 3 ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following encoding parameters can be adjusted separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; via the drop down menus for encoding appears a short notice , which is the local coding . ( this can &apos;t be changed here and has a purely inform@@ al character . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adjust the file encoding for source files . this imp@@ acted , as special characters are handled and interpre@@ t . because the coding for each file is individually configur@@ able , even files with different encoding can be compared and merged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have edited a file , you can define it for saving the encoding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you define pre@@ processing command , it might not work with your code@@ c . ( for example , your files can only use 16 @-@ bit ASCII , but using this option can only define the encoding output of pre@@ processing commands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; switch this off to supp@@ ress the high@@ lighting of changes in white characters in text or review , if the options are able to ignore or ignore the options numbers or ignore &quot; ( C + + comments . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences between two and the three files will be displayed . after selection of A &amp; B ; gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; C ; C is indicated next to the normal , a second transfer @-@ column with the required information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , one would like to use the space on the screen for long lines . simply switch the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
arran@@ ges the comparison windows by side or succes@@ sively . this can also be useful for viewing long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , look at the differences and decide to merge the files . if you use only two files . ( if this function is used to restart the merge code , then the name of the last used file will be retained . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when reading a file it will first be handed over to this external command , and will not write the file itself , that is exactly the file itself . you can use this function e.g. for removing distur@@ bing parts or to correct rendering . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when reading a file it will be handed over to this external command . once a normal default directive is specified ( see above ) , the output of command is equal to the line output , which equ@@ ates exactly to your needs . every input line must have one corresponding output line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea behind it is possible to allow more flexibility when setting the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users would like to program it . good news is , however , that in most cases be used or per@@ l completely sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this context , use this pre @-@ processing command to change the input in big letters : &quot; * \ \ &quot; / \ \ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; * \ \ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; * \ \ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; * \ \ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CVS and other version control systems use some key words to automatically insert drawing tablets ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . now , the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while you experim@@ enting with sed experim@@ enting , you may begin to understand and perhaps like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs which support very similar things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre @-@ processing command to be equal . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; The character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hits and each match will be replaced so quasi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , you might want to perform several results at one time . then you can use the Sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; , to separate the compositions of each other . for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of used you can also use something different like per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ e -@@ e &apos; s / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / En@@ forcement / switch &quot; Ho@@ wever it needs only some details . where used \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires only ( and ) without the lead &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data after the normal pre @-@ processor is maintained for displaying , and to merge . further operations change only the data , which looks the Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ out@@ al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre @-@ processor the Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ out@@ has the output of the normal pre @-@ processor as input . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function the text changes or differences , you cannot notice certain differences and destroy important dates in the worst case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; often , programm@@ ers have to edit a number of files in a folder . this is why you can compare and assemble complete folders with &amp; diff@@ use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
... makes a suggestion for each object ; you can adjust the proposal before the start .
... can sim@@ ulate the mer@@ ging and sim@@ ulate the sim@@ ulated changes without them really perform ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; selected promotions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or with selected objects ( F@@ 6 @-@ key ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is very similar to the same and mer@@ ging of single files . you only have to open a folder on the command line or in the dialog file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if three folders are merged . then folder 1 is used as the base . if no target folders was specified , use &amp; diff@@ used as a target folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not to merge . to select the merge , you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( further details follow . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while reading the folder , a little news window informs about the current progress . if you cancel the folder scan , only the files are listed below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when scanning the folder is completed , shows &amp; diff@@ use ; a list window with the results on the left hand side , ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
each file and any folder found during the scan was found here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click here .
the folder structure is usually folded up . you can click on the + / - click on the + / - click on the object and fold all sub@@ directories with which you can fold or fold all sub@@ directories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you double click on a file , the file comparison will start and it appears a comparison windows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the icon in the column name reflects the type of file in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the type of file is different in the other folders there is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane with the selected object . if the merge operation is started automatically , you will be informed about problems of this type .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as shown in the above picture , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with identical entries , the color is identical also , even if the number of entries is different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; folders are considered to be identical if their entire content is identical . then , ste@@ wards the same colour . at folders the age is in@@ significant for its colour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea to this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colours reflect the colors of a leaf again which turns yellow and later when it is old is red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; A and C are identical , but not B : copying B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; A and B are identical , but not C : copying C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; A , B and C cannot have the same data type ( e.g. if A file and B is a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting data types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects may not start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
... A and B don &apos;t have the same data type ( e.g. if A file and B is a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting data types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects can exist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mode to synchron@@ ize is active , if only two folders and no explic@@ it target folders are active . then select the required action , so that both folders are identical . if necessary for an entry ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
... A and B exist but not the same are identical : the user can store the result in both folders . ( the user sees only the visible file name for the output file only B ; directly after the merge operation &amp; diff@@ used ; B to A. )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when two folders are merged , then select the new file instead of mer@@ ging ( un@@ sure ) error message . if the files are different , but the date is identical . if such faul@@ ts are not removed .. Sol@@ ange can &apos;t be started . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during mer@@ ging a file will be processed after the others . you status column shows the status of the merge operation and if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and see whether the status is al@@ right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when in the setup dialog , the file compar@@ ative method is Full analysis , K@@ diff@@ 3 contains further columns . this includes the number of un@@ resolved , deleted , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for dissolved conflicts will only appear when three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) or all the entries at once . if you have selected all the co@@ uns@@ ets action ( including in all sub@@ folders ) you can start mer@@ ging .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please note : if you have no target folders , then in the Three @-@ folder merge mode B is used as a target and for syn@@ cing the B and / or B will be used as a target . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries can be displayed in the folder structure as well . there are some options to be ski@@ pped in the folder structure . check these options to avoid un@@ happy surprises : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to merge all entries : select a list of entries / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the symbol symbol ) : select the action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when using contra@@ dic@@ tory Dat@@ es , there are still invalid mer@@ ging actions , a message appears to indicate the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you merge all entries , a dialog window will appear with the options em@@ ulate , sim@@ ulate and cancel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sim@@ ulate sim@@ ulate if you would like to see what would happen without the really changes , you will then receive a detailed list of all actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; Bo@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute specific actions with all entries . when a manual operation is necessary ( summar@@ ize a single file ) you will open a merge window ( observe the screenshot ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are ready with a file , choose another folder merge / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you are not saved , a corresponding dialog will appear . then , &amp; cau@@ d@@ 3 will proceed with the next entry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the end of the list , you will see a message and full status information . at the end of the list , you can try to skip the cause or skip the problem or skip the problem before you merge with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if some entries have been assembled individually , these entries ( in the current session ) and will not be saved again . only if you change the merge operation , these entries will be merged again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; Cor@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ) has created a section called directory connection with these options :
only files that are fit on the indicated pattern are shown in the element tree . multiple sample holder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default value is * . folders must not correspond to this pattern .
files and folders that conform to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can use more than one pattern . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that conform to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can use more than one pattern . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
ignore files which can also be ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this folder can be specified using a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ or file . ( watch under info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems files have a distor@@ ted attribute . in other file systems a leading dot is marked as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with links to files : if the option is disabled , symbolic short@@ cuts are compared when the option is switched on , the files will be compared to the links below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with links to Fol@@ der : if the option is disabled when the option is switched off . if the option is switched on . a link to a folder named on itself would lead to a junction using the link . ) This option is switched off in default .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete analysis of any file through and displays the statisti@@ c columns . ( the number of deleted , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and significantly slower when they appear on files containing no text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you compare large folders through a slow network , it &apos;s possibly faster to compare the chan@@ ges@@ tion and file size . please use caution . this option is switched off in default . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
similar to a chan@@ ges@@ et date . it is not a real comparison instead . it can be considered equally . this can be useful when copying the chan@@ ges@@ tion date . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activ@@ ating the synchron@@ izing mode when two folders are compared and no targets are listed . in this mode , the results of merge files are saved in both folders . this option is switched off in default . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are differences in place , the copy of the newer file is being proposed as an action . ( this is considered in@@ secure , because the other file is not changed also . ) This option is switched off in default . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a file or folder is replaced or deleted , this will also be deleted by default . if an old backup file is already deleted , this option is not only switched on from the whole folder . this option is switched on in the default . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normally , the folder merge functionality is visible on the merge of single files ; you can turn the window divi@@ ding window in the window panel and switch between the two views from the directory and folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; probably you prefer a file easily with double @-@ click . nevertheless , there is also a corresponding menu item . you can also use a single file directly from the merge menu , and the file will not be guided again if you launch the folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this status is lost however if you want to read the directory again : list of the directory : new
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of Ki@@ o slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open files on local or remote computer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed file , with a local folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a couple of things you should consider :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a path can be relatively in@@ . or .. included . that &apos;s not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , space &gt; % 20 ; etc . ) for example has a file with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , due to the file system on the server , sometimes the used protocol is followed by a brief list of limitations : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or can &apos;t be differenti@@ ated if a link to a file or folder shows . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or modification of change . this is why the authori@@ zation or change of change is possible from the original . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main purpose is at present as a brush viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op always starts the built @-@ in differences . in order to view K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the viewer wall and then select In K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normally requires &amp; col@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it does not apply as a part , the code file takes from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then the patch starts to recover the missing file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file , and it does not work if none of the original files exist . moreover , the original files have changed since the generation of the patch file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when &amp; cau@@ tious ; as part is executed , it only supports the compar@@ is@@ ons of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . the mer@@ ging or the same of folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now it is complicated ) , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I use GPL @-@ programs very long and have learned a lot while I saw in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers who have gone along this path or to get it so .
you have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script should not be found in the correct PRE@@ F@@ IX / local but then K@@ DE will not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find more information about this topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical . if not only a non @-@ white characters will be treated as not the same . i@@ F . lines . next to each other , this is this H@@ is @-@ the case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Editor is noted for any difference in the files where it begins and where it ends . this important information is simply lost when the result is simply saved as text file and it is too much effort to design an extra file format that could store this information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effort for this was so far too big . you can always recover a particular version by selecting a source A / B / C , to process larger quantities of text should be another editor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after removing text is suddenly lt ; no sr@@ c lin@@ ens ; appeared and the text cannot be extingu@@ ished , which means that and how can this be removed ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; ble@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors to empha@@ size difference . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . for this , please use another editor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many good ideas and errors came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !

information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE you can find on the homepage .
a list of the last changes you can find under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in a tran@@ ell package .
to comp@@ ile &amp; re@@ diff@@ use ; on a system with &amp; K@@ DE ; to comp@@ ile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; Distribution :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ DE gives you the folder inside your system , where K@@ DE are installed , you will find more details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since &amp; cau@@ tious ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should not encounter any problems while comp@@ iling . should you encounter difficulties , please report on the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ mailing lists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) into the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or orbit ) add the text from the clip@@ board to the current cursor position and replaces the current selection .
only differences in view : files that are identical in all folders are not in the folder structure and therefore are not in the target folder .
( in the current program version you need to update to these options the folder with the function update . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are only entries shown , the differences feature . if the target folders are not included in the target folder , they are missing after mer@@ ging . ( behavior is likely to be switched off in default . ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note the buttons to select the font with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you are already present on one of the buttons at the end of the selected group when the rows are already existing , you will click on the button accordingly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in default , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a thumb@@ nail of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite practical to change their size , or move them , or move them . this works within a desktop and in several . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops and running applications in running applications , and the applications can be selected and even be moved on desktop and elsewhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the medium mouse button window within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager can be moved . movement is possible both within a desktop and on other working surfaces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse click is clicked with : if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , click the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minim@@ ise , maxim@@ ize working on desktop and end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of the desktop . appears only when clicked on an application .
sends the application to selected virtual desktop . appears only when clicked on an application .
is this check box marked that window within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager can be moved with central mouse buttons on desktop and also to other work surfaces .
when this field is crossed , in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the name of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are shown .
check out this field makes the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; view the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if you view the number of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops then the names are provided with folder numbers , &amp; eg ; 1 Desktop .
when this field is crossed , the background of each desktop will also be displayed as background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as little windows in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty spaces are displayed to enable their selection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple steps with the proportions of the program window . symbol indicates the window with its standard icon and pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager can be specified : classic leaves &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . in a 2x@@ n @-@ grid are known as from p@@ ager applications in some other windows of windows ; Horizont@@ al shows all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a vertical and vertical section which is very good for displaying side on the desktop .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager can be used as an alternative to p@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can display and move the window as symbols or with its content and it is also running outside the control panel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click on the right mouse button within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , and subsequent sel@@ ector switch ... makes dialog settings appear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently it may not be changed in dialog settings . but you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / cryp@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or V@@ I. In this file you need to login to your system administrator and assign it to your system administrator . possible values are :

&amp; mag ; is a screenshot of a screen . you can use &amp; mag ; this application is interesting for the small printed or the exact viewing of a picture . this application includes artists , web designer and people with a vision . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag ;
&amp; mag ; is a very powerful application which is constantly extended with new functions . it is optimized for use on powerful computers .
if you &amp; mag ; start a window as shown above . the main window of the screen is displayed . in the following it is displayed as an enlarged window . the picture shows the enlarged area of the screen and is described in the following as a window .
in the default setting &amp; mag ; the area around the mouse @-@ cursor is like a mobile phone . alternatively you can set a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( drop @-@ down mode ) or the environment of the mouse pointing at the screen ( eg ; on the left of the screen ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would you like to avoid that the mouse cursor is shown in the enlarged window , please note that the cursor &apos;s cursor is capable to recognize the form of the mouse logger . this is always the standard K@@ DE ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse cursor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the selection mode , you can change the selection window to your own needs . you can change it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
move the mouse cursor to the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button . so you can catch up the content of the magni@@ fying machine and move it with the arrow keys .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you add the &amp; Shift key , press or use the M@@ MB ; you can move the box window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection box . note that the upper left corner of the selection window will remain firm and only moving the lower right corner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; mag ; has a lot of features . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , copy it into the clip@@ board ( to add it later into other applications ) , turning the image and much more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
start or stops the update of the display . the stop of the update causes that the required CPU time goes against 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choose the Update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very high ) . the higher the refresh rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this mode , a selection of the selected area will be displayed in a window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; mag ; Automati@@ cally uses your pre@@ defined short commands to save files , opening a new window , print , new@@ com@@ ads ( with the button to re@@ load in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and Ver@@ dro@@ pping &amp; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you may also know as &amp; colle@@ gi@@ fier , is a LCD screen . you can use an magni@@ fying glass to use the small printed item in a newspaper or photograph . this application is suitable for different kind of benefits : from resear@@ ching or artist to web designer or visually imp@@ aired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&amp; acqu@@ isitions ; was developed by O@@ la@@ f Schmidt o@@ schmi@@ dt @ k@@ de@@ .org and Sar@@ ang Lak@@ are Sar@@ ang @ us@@ er@@ s.@@ s@@ f.@@ net and Michael For@@ ster For@@ ster @ f@@ mi@@ .@@ uni @-@ pass@@ au@@ .de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , em@@ ulates a mouse click on the same spot as the mouse cursor is thinking about the same place . it is meant to help people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome ( repeti@@ tive @-@ in @-@ injury ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , em@@ ulates a mouse click on the same place . it is intended to assist people who em@@ ulate the mouse within the correct answer . moreover , it can em@@ ulate the mouse with the mouse . this requires little practice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , can handle the pain that when clicking the mouse is created and helps to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you can search for pain caused by using your computer . if this is not done yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to make it clear once : even though &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain avo@@ ids that when clicking with the mouse is useless , useless . and as with all ergonomic ai@@ ds , the result can fall for each differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and guides a mouse click here as soon as you break the movement shortly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clever lock is activated , power &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . move the mouse , wait until the end of the mouse . this way you can perform the drag by the mouse button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this delay time must be put away after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click brings out .
is Intel@@ lig@@ ently shift ON is enabled . the time is adjusted for time ( 1 / 10 s ) before the mouse button is set up before the mouse button is waiting again when there is no moving because of the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports the clicking by mouse shift . this function creates a slow moving forward by clicking on the right and back . a slow moving towards the right and back leads to a double click . these movements are started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . it can be changed later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the sound is delayed , you can move &amp; K@@ DE ; to move the response time , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose Sound System and here the rider General . there you can adjust the sound system to reduce the response times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started ; for each start by &amp; K@@ DE ; this function is currently only available under &amp; K@@ DE ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments please check out how to automatically start a program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when all settings are set back to the dialog when opening the dialog , you have already pushed the button below to reset the settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; best you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , first with the pre@@ ferences . especially the intelligent slide you should start off first . if you then proceed to the automatic mouse click you can put on the intelligent slide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you use the audible click then it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; K@@ DE ; in sounds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first of all , you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect : clicking on the neutral parts of windows or at spots in the browser window , which does not link to un@@ inten@@ tional reactions . you can therefore use the mouse in such places until you would like to use them again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your mouse is ru@@ cking , you should clean your mouse . that is usually quite simple . the trick is that you don &apos;t just clean the mouse ball but also the roles , which comes into contact with the mouse ball . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , you have to remove the mouse ball . as this is done from mouse to mouse , but it should be clear when you view the under@@ side of the mouse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have removed the ball , you would need to see the roles . these are on the sides of the hole , into which the ball was inserted . the dirt and dirt can be easily scrat@@ ched with a flat blade or finger nails . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in very rare situations the operating system interrup@@ ts the operating system of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you have just started a shifting tool that means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool does not mean that the operation can no longer be done by rele@@ asing the mouse button .
this happens if you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use a window manager or a window .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the solution to this problem is that you can accomplish even a mouse click . by this , the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is reset and you can continue as usual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
problem : if you input text tries to execute &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and puts the cursor into another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor where you want to place it . but don &apos;t use the mouse on a neutral area of desktop if you want to go through by un@@ solved mouse clicks . secure areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the title line of windows .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to work with the intelligent interface , but I don &apos;t create it to edit text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the intelligent slide is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and it takes its time before you want to move and add any other action to paste it back into the clip@@ board . but it will probably manage to cause any problems with you . here are some advice here : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; simply use the intelligent slide , if you just start to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , use the Shift key down to the other end of the text , while you move the mouse cursor to the other end of the text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
use the audible mouse click . this will start any time when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button pressed a sound like a mouse click . so you can easily move the intelligent slide without the audible mouse click . but for that purpose it requires some exercise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , you need to have the X@@ test extension for &amp; X window ; it should be the case on most systems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and loudspeaker , and these correctly set up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , emphas@@ ises the mouse button soon as the mouse cursor arrives . this program has been developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome and to which the activity of the mouse are processed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , can also be configured in addition to a certain period of time before the mouse is left . in this way the mouse can be done , pulling and dro@@ pping with the mouse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program , with the silent user you can speak their computer for yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; you can let me speak the computer for yourself . the user can choose from a list with the loc@@ alized Phra@@ ses , which should be spoken again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the first page of the assist@@ ants ( left screenshot ) , enter the command later used for the speech output of text . further details can be found in the description of the setup dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the second side , you can select the default text pass@@ code . from the text pass@@ ages you can often need to type in . the text passages can of course be edited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the third side ( right screenshot ) you can determine the dictionary for Wor@@ ter@@ wal@@ ker . &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . additionally you can compare the names of words with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth is clearly and contains basically a input field for the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ ment of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen picture ) and a reference memory of the already spoken phra@@ ses ( the upper white field in the screen picture ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you mouth spins , you can enter the sentences in the input field which you want to hear . each spoken phra@@ se is attached to the memory memory . you can select from it , which should be spoken again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the Settings menu k@@ mouth ; setting up the dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two maps , voice output and settings , the page Wor@@ ter@@ eph@@ an and the page K@@ TT@@ SD voice service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the input field of the card reader , enter the command to call the language generator . in the drop under the input field , set the encoding to the language generator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to share the text . select the check box , if the text remains unchanged as default to the language generator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the check box is not selected , the text is passed as parameters . you can use the following wild@@ card : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation on your language generator . examples are listed in the App@@ endix . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with a kt@@ ts@@ d as language service you will use &amp; mouth ; as first try to pass the text on this page . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a standardized interface for voice output and that is currently being developed in SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by selecting a text passage , you &apos;ll determine what action is triggered by the Shift or by selecting a text passage in the menu folder , or in the bar for text pass@@ a@@ ners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the selection of so@@ fort , the chosen text passage is directly spoken and additionally shown in the exp@@ iry date . the selected text passage will only be entered into the input field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the second selection box closing of the editing window for text pass@@ agen@@ ers , you can specify whether the play@@ pass@@ log@@ book will be stored automatically when closing the editing window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the book is saved with the selection of text @-@ pass@@ agen@@ ers , and if you choose changes , the text password will be saved . ask whether the text password will be stored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the page Wor@@ ter@@ gän@@ ger contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the Wor@@ ter@@ wal@@ ker . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box indicates if you select more than a dictionary . with this drop @-@ down menu you can choose the currently used dictionary to deal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the buttons on the side , you can delete or add the order of books or set them into a file . below the list , you can edit the language and select the language for the dictionary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
select for this source the required language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; now reads the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentation . the Frequ@@ ency of the individual words is simply compare by quer@@ ying the individual words . in addition you can add the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to respond only correctly into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; mouth ; ask what dic@@ tion@@ aries are summar@@ ised and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this option , specify a new , empty dictionary without entries . then add a new dictionary to the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary in the course of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main area of the window to the processing of text passages is two divided . in the upper part , text boards are displayed as a tree structure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the lower part , you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , or change the associated short@@ cuts . if you have selected a text passage , you can only change its name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actions like new text passages or books add or delete selected text passages and books , either by selecting the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a fold @-@ down menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through pulling with your mouse to the new site or with the cursor keys and the &amp; Alt ; button , you can change the order of text @-@ fitting templates or passages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if in input field , a text section is selected , otherwise the selected area of the exp@@ iry date will be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the selected text is copied to clip@@ board . if in input field , a text section is selected , otherwise the selected area of the exp@@ iry date will be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used otherwise , otherwise the selected phra@@ ses of the s@@ ali@@ va . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the tool@@ bar is displayed , a sli@@ dable tool@@ bar is displayed with buttons for frequently used commands . by clicking the tool@@ bar , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another spot by clicking on the p@@ hat@@ ched left side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the menu entry is crossed , a narrow body in the lower part of the main window with clu@@ es about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth is indicated when not crossed , this status bar is hidden . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , this menu entry is shown with entries . by clicking on the tool@@ bar it can be moved directly below the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the p@@ hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; probably you have not entered the command for voice output properly or not fully typ@@ ed . open the page General Settings , and specify the command for voice output on the card issue . ( see dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers to further details . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the festival is a voice output system from the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are currently supported . the license allows to use festival free and spread without restrictions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to show an example of command line for setting the language output is assumed that the festival is installed in the folder / us@@ r / local / festival . the command to voice is then :
Free@@ TTS is a language generator . currently it supports only the English language generator . currently it supports only the English language . the license allows to use Free@@ TTS free of charge and distribute without restrictions .
to show an example of command line for setting up the language output is assumed that Free@@ TTS is installed in the folder / us@@ r / local / fre@@ ops . the voice output is then possible with one of the three command line examples :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the third example , this option must be switched on as standard input . ( this is the recommended example of Free@@ TTS ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of ph@@ on@@ emes in a wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei . therefore an additional program converts the text to ph@@ on@@ emes in order to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ commercial applications .
in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text to ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA which is H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA in / us@@ r / local / local / local / mb@@ ro@@ la .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax is pleased to have the last sign of the text , so that an additional sign needs to be attached . so the full command is more elabor@@ ate than in the other examples : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / us@@ r / local / pag@@ an / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / disable / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / de@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all parts of the command must be written in one line , sending the data as standard input has to be switched on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the voice edition dem@@ on of &amp; K@@ DE ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is one &amp; K@@ DE ; - further language service provided by all &amp; K@@ DE ; applications is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different speech output systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as setting of the language generator takes place only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use as kt@@ ts@@ d as language service in &amp; mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to set setting , use the K@@ TT@@ SD voice service that appears in the dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use &amp; mouth ; you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally as memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends on individual computers and configuration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application that can &apos;t speak with the people who can &apos;t speak , let text be saved through the calcul@@ ator . a list is already saved , which the user can always re@@ plen@@ ish new expenses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth does not include any language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . on the computer a voice syn@@ thesizer must be installed .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voice output service of &amp; K@@ DE ; , a application without any visible window , the TTS services via &amp; D@@ Bus ; offers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and setup of kt@@ ts@@ d on kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a module for the text editor &amp; Kate , with which a text file can be read or partially . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

before you can use &amp; kt@@ on ; you need to install and properly set the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . see also
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when starting at the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as usual , the card card is shown . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the card can be arranged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most TTS Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female subjects . they should also set up several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . they should at least use a speaker before you &amp; kt@@ ats , since the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher uses the standard speakers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
different speakers for the same syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are comparable with several printer spo@@ ons for the same printer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you click on the card driver speaker in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the card card is displayed automatically when you start a kt@@ t@@ rough and no speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all speakers will appear in this list . the preferred speaker is mentioned above in the list . the top speaker is used for speech output when there is no speaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a mouse click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a mouse click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a mouse click a voice from the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speakers in the list determines its priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ on ; -@@ system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choose a voice type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a Jun@@ gen@@ - and maid &apos;s voice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you click here , on the new spokes@@ man for the card game appears . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now you can use &amp; kt@@ on . go back to the card label General and check if language output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled to order and manage language output . click on the card card to start and manage text jobs . see .
if you have at least one speaker you can set up for a speaker system by &amp; K@@ DE ; please click on the card reader to open this map . here you can set some general options .
mark this check box in order to enable the &amp; kt@@ on ; this start is successful ; and you can make the k@@ DE @-@ TTS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) and you can make text jobs and preview the TTS System by &amp; K@@ DE ; disabled .
if kt@@ t@@ sm@@ s is completed ; runs &amp; kt@@ on ; on the subject if the field output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) output .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is this check box marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is automatically displayed in the Control system &apos;s system area , it dis@@ appears once again and when reading is finished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the buttons in this series you can start text contracts , stop , stop and record . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the buttons in this series , you can read the current text in the &amp; K@@ DE ; clip@@ board , or open a text file to preview . you can also switch the speaker for an order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click on users or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all sides . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the card card orders will only be displayed if K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to activate K@@ TT@@ SD and activate speech output on the card folder ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; K@@ DE ; you can read the text of the displayed web page . after a short time , select the text edition to start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is almost always meaningful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; - pre@@ list@@ ings and other invisible brands will also be read . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; K@@ DE ; you can read the displayed text , and select the text that is read before , and select the text edition in the main menu . then select the language output . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also works if &amp; Kate ; in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ Noti@@ fy is the news system of &amp; K@@ DE ; , which you know about your defined events . you can also read the text of these messages also by &amp; kt@@ ops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; K@@ DE ; you can create different kinds of messages ; for example , you can set up a message in which your nick@@ name comes . with &amp; kt@@ ops , you can then read the IR@@ C message text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; supports a &amp; K@@ DE ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry will appear on the settings of this program . the settings here for K@@ Noti@@ fy may differ depending on application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; filter to string composition offer a good deal in &amp; kt@@ on ; wrong or incorrect messages ; the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is sent to the delivery / local / in@@ box , since this can be accepted as provided for most cases . read also here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
filters are one of the advanced abilities of &amp; kt@@ on ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fil@@ tering , text processed , before he is sent to the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for clari@@ fying words or short@@ cuts , to select a matching language and speaker , or to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to understand the functioning of filters , it &apos;s important to know how the program &quot; Speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ats ; different types of texts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the output of screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it will be pre@@ configured to all other orders , and keeps these orders . if the output of the Screen Reader is read again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warning have the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the issu@@ ance of messages and ordinary text , after the issue of warning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; News you have the next first priority . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example susp@@ icious normal lyrics . while you are looking for a long text on a website , you can welcome you the space . &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ al@@ er@@ ts are also messages . read more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest is simple text contracts . every order that you enter by the card card is a text contract . KS@@ ay@@ ite is an example intended for applications that own text contracts , which have no special ur@@ gency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all four types of order are processed in queu@@ e , with the exception of the Screen @-@ Re@@ aders . when a application reads the Screen @-@ Re@@ aders , this issue will be stopped and stopped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first you have to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , news , and word jobs as well as on &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ News . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; filter edit the lyrics and pass it on the next filter . at the moment , there are three types of filters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can be further types of filters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; replacing character string parts replace parts of a text through text , or specify either as words or as regular expressions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; XML ; trans@@ formers use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to another format . in the delivery of &amp; kt@@ on ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files to the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Spe@@ aker filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text , or depending on the program , send the text on &amp; kt@@ on . if you have an example on the card file a feminine voice can be read about it . Si@@ eh@@ e can be read about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter has not found its rules , the text remains unchanged at the next filters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a text deal , a notification or a message ; sent to &amp; kt@@ on ; sent by all the activated filters , they are processed in the order in the order from top to bottom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows the list of the set @-@ up filter . if a filter is not enabled , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed in the series according to the bottom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of the filter , and it will be displayed further below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for setting character fil@@ tering , you need to insert a list of words or regular expression as a compar@@ ative pattern . this text is exchanged for the corresponding replacement text . large and lower case is not considered when compared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter a name for your filter . you can select your name as you like , it must only differ from the name of the other filters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter re@@ sembles the text in the column according to the string , and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column . the list is processed in the displayed sequence from top to bottom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with these buttons , you can store a list of words or regular expressions out of a file that can store or delete a list of file , added the entries from the file to the existing list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a language included , the filter will only be applied if the spokes@@ man for the text contract can display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you click at the mouse click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; key . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a value entered , the filter will only be applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separately by comm@@ a . example : conversation , K@@ Mail &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
application ID running programs can be reached with the program q@@ dbus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ bus ; the application ID copy @-@ 34@@ 32 has to be entered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this filter is only applied to the text when all conditions agree with one entry in the box . if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when compar@@ ing words the string offset filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ator ( space ) on both sides .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this manual , you do not find instructions for writing regular expression . if you have the &amp; K@@ DE ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the col@@ am@@ big@@ ti@@ ls package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; XML ; trans@@ duc@@ er translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format in another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such form@@ work . it can only be applied to your system x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
type the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c User Language program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is achiev@@ able across the PAT@@ H environment . x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is also enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the speaker input filter , you can send text to a specific speaker , or specify a speaker with certain characteristics . for example , you can define the texts written by email from a female voice . see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text indicates the filter , the speaker is chosen according to the speaker . the speaker is chosen according to the speaker by the subject , and sends the characteristics of the speaker by the card speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a value entered here , if the text contains the entered regular expression . if the text has the entered regular expression . if the text has the entered regular expression , you can retrieve it with a click on the button to get help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#93; &gt; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the text meets the specified filter conditions here , the speaker is chosen to indicate the desired requirements at the best above . click the button on the right to view the dialog box selection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
use these buttons to save or delete your speech settings or delete all settings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only then apply to the text when all conditions apply to this filter if all conditions apply to this filter if all conditions apply to this filter , if you have to enter at least one constra@@ int . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voice output API , by &amp; K@@ DE ; can provide a TTS skills by the programmer . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , which can be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , with voice syn@@ thesizer , so that syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers can use this syn@@ thesizer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

applications for voice service via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface by &amp; K@@ DE ; by the program kt@@ ts@@ d on the object K@@ Speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is text of text to read , and option a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands
open two &amp; console ; -@@ Window . just start a window in a window then kt@@ et sm@@ gr in the other .
none of the language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers supported my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ re@@ form@@ er@@ filter set , but when using the module for festival pages , websites are not read . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ i.@@ e if you do not need to use this voice to read websites . make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found over the PAT@@ H environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certain signs or pun@@ ctu@@ ation characters appear to cause mistakes in syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only Kau@@ n @-@ cat@@ sch . what can I do against it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first of all , make sure the option character encoding is set to the correct language . if there are problems with certain signs or words , these may be solved by a string offset filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

KT@@ TS works with any language syn@@ thesizer that can be started on the command line in a &amp; console ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list of the languages mentioned above can be incomplete or ob@@ sol@@ ete , and therefore refer to the description of the syn@@ thesizer to the supported language . watch for information that are not included in this manual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the program &quot; Speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher , &quot; uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ats , use the developer team for use with any other syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c User Language program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; but not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command ap@@ t @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to comp@@ ile business ; you need to comp@@ ile a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including the c@@ deli@@ bs and the application files for the &quot; Speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher program . &quot;
if you have downloaded the source texts by &amp; kt@@ on ; downloaded from the source text archive for k@@ de@@ acces@@ sibility or comp@@ ile all night currently created Tar@@ ball : we install and install the program with the following commands :
before you use &amp; kt@@ on ; you first check if speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your voice syn@@ thesizer . you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ skri@@ t sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; Ori@@ ts ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ on ; the program ty@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is to be developed so further that the installation of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is possible directly and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer required .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a long text will be disman@@ tled into single sentences . the user may go back , repeat the output or cancel the output . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an application has text on &amp; kt@@ on , you can claim the attributes of the preferred speaker for the issue . if you want to learn more about it , otherwise you will learn how &amp; kt@@ on will select a speaker you will see in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you click on the card game to add , and click on to edit a speaker in the list or on edit it is shown below the device &apos;s device for festival interactive . details on the modules can be found under . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
enter the path to the exec@@ utable fes@@ tival@@ program . when the path to Festival is contained in PAT@@ H you will need to enter only festival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the character encoding for text that will be passed to festival . in general , this setting is performed automatically . in general , Western languages are valid ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak , ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with these sli@@ ders , you adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can not select some regulator , you cannot display this grey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n s need to be loaded for several seconds due to their size . if you have loaded this check box , so the first movement will be syn@@ thes@@ ized faster when starting with K@@ TT@@ SD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this check box cannot be selected , do not have any speakers set up ( or do not forget to click on users ) . see .
if the check box is marked with the starting string the program window is displayed . otherwise the program window is displayed in the system stage but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if K@@ TT@@ SD is still not running , it appears in the system area to read a text as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text . this enables you to read or otherwise control the device . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here all orders are listed in the queu@@ e , along with the application that has set the order , the number of pro@@ positions and the just processed set . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card card . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the buttons in this series you can select a sati@@ n in the list , which is selected in the list below , pre@@ - or return . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with one click on OK , all changes of the settings ( also on the other cards ) and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr will become a symbol in the system section . click on this icon to view the program window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the sound system &amp; arts is not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here only text contracts are listed and managed . outputs of screen Re@@ aders , War@@ nings and News are not displayed . further information about the message types of &amp; kt@@ ops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the kind of audio output here . if one component cannot be selected , or kt@@ ops ; either compiled without support for the relevant audio module , does not load the necessary libraries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if G@@ asp@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de should be used for audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must select at least one module . have you select the PCM device here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; set the sound speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % equivalent to half the normal speaking speed . so these settings can be implemented , the So@@ x program must be installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
click Apply to Apply the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ on ; system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list of the AL@@ SA devices includes all PCM devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you have to figure out what device works with you . in doubt , choose Standard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this map , you can set up special actions that will always be executed if the word order will be interrupted by a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ops ; processes four types of speech contracts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the output of screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it will be pre@@ configured to all other orders , after the issu@@ ing of the Screen Reader , the requested orders will be res@@ umed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
warning will have the next priority level . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning will keep the issu@@ ance of messages and normal text . these orders will continue after reading the warning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; News have the next priority . a message does not break normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example for an application that can read news . just a long text on a website , you can welcome somebody who enters the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will receive a text by a message , warning or issue of a screen saver , adds &amp; kt@@ on ; the audio output to the queu@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this audio file will always be played when a regular text message is interrupted . if both the leit@@ ner sound are active as well as introduc@@ tory message , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings on this map are only valid for normal text jobs . there are no special promotions for messages , war@@ nings and the expenditure of screen reproduction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to start reading with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ Noti@@ fy news , run t@@ rough and click al@@ er@@ ts . the card notification will appear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
marking this check box in order to shift the read of &amp; K@@ DE ; this setting is not marked off and the other settings are disabled and stored ; do not read noti@@ fications .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this setting is selected , al@@ er@@ ts will be played with which a sound is played , of &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use these buttons to add events to add or delete events . if you click on the button , a dialog will appear in which you want to add the application and event that you want to add to list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this event reads the message before , the &amp; conversation ; if somebody mentioned in a IR@@ C message your nick@@ name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all events , given in the list nothing else , will be ignored by &amp; ct@@ ts ; ignored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
use this drop down where to determine what &amp; kt@@ on ; do you have the following selection options :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have chosen to read user defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following wild@@ card : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can enter here the properties of the desired speaker . standard cho@@ oses the speaker , which is shown in the list on the card key as the top entry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note that there are three levels for events . if the action is set for any particular event of a specific application , this action is executed for all other events of particular application . as the last option the action is defined by default ( all other events ) was specified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the event All noti@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events can not be deleted from the list . for this , you can define the prior notification settings as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; save the button save to store the settings for the mess@@ aging in a file . all the events will start with the events in the list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except All notification are deleted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard for marking text for voice output , the speech speed , the volume of voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is a part of Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W3@@ C standard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ops ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in the basic functions . the following constra@@ ints are available :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , since this is the default voice , the festival is used at the SS@@ ML output . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the settings for speed or sound at the festival configuration dialog is not set to 100@@ n@@ bsp ; , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ ot@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#93; = &apos; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &apos; UTF @-@ 8 &apos; ? &#93; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / / / W3@@ C / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. Amen . who has slept in my bed ? asked the Bär@@ en@@ son . &#93; &#93; &gt; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ posi@@ tional filters ( SD@@ B filter ) . allow the first set to be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole word order , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support it directly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here you can see the pro@@ posi@@ tional filters . when the first start of &amp; kt@@ on is automatically set up , you may change its settings or add further pro@@ posi@@ tional filters , but beginners will not fru@@ strate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the sim@@ pl@@ est part you can learn how to select the speaker selection and select text for speaking , please check out how the speaker selection is selected and check out how to select the speaker selection . for this purpose you have to have more than one speaker . otherwise , the filter has to be in@@ effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; kt@@ on ; then start quicker with the preview , as only the first set must be processed and not all text block , what can be very long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can then hold or cancel text contracts on the card card , even if the syn@@ thesizer does not support this function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these reasons , the normal header filter is automatically set when you start a kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr to the first time . it cannot be removed , unless you know what you are doing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automatically compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ posi@@ tional and add a tab character ( S@@ im@@ al@@ code 8 ) to the pro@@ posi@@ tional sign ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) from the fil@@ tering , the default value filter is automatically re@@ tains to the pun@@ ctu@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ BD filters are never applied on &amp; K@@ DE ; messages , war@@ nings , news or the output of screen regeneration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have removed from re@@ viewing the normal pro@@ bor@@ ance filter , you can re@@ insert this again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the map selection menu , you can skip the settings for the application . the card card will appear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the standard speaker ( the top on the card card ) . in other words : there will be no microphone properties specified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use the most appropriate speaker , which has all the properties of a set speaker . if you select the settings of the speaker , select &amp; kt@@ ops ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ops ; otherwise select the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
select the method for entering the desired speech characteristics by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the properties of the desired speaker . if this feature does not play a matter , enter nothing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mark this check box if the property should have priority for any other properties . you can also set several markings here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the language is a critical factor when issu@@ ing the issue , it is always treated as a primary property . the only case if you possibly know that a specific application can be sent in another language as the language environment in the working environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to er@@ ase all properties in the subject area , use the following standard speakers , click on the selection button and then apply to speaker that corresponds to the following . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this case 0 for the last text contract in the queu@@ e . you can also specify a order number . ( no order number is required to enter 0 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr st@@ inks immediately when it is started . I have compiled my de@@ bug support , but I have no trace@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is crashed and stopped . probably you must register G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x the command G@@ ST @-@ register . if the problem is not solved , you may try to upgrade or un@@ install the link . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work if I play a text contract with another application of music . when I hold a text contract , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ops ; a message appears : i@@ to open PCM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on your system , there is a problem that conflicts with AL@@ SA that will prevent a simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices , on the web page of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) under www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ B@@ t@@ .org . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have downloaded an additional Voice for festival from the Internet . I have installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not show this voice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / qui@@ ts@@ d / vo@@ l / vo@@ l / vo@@ ices . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to developers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the audio card audio there is a setting speed . to enable it , the program must be stri@@ k@@ able and above the surrounding variable PAT@@ H . depending on the selected voice , this function is active or in@@ active . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the settings for the speech speed are ignored when &amp; ct@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; ( which is controlled ; ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or if you have very brave ones will change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML rec@@ er@@ filter and put up the speech speed up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t manage to read websites with a female voice . I set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; ct@@ ts ; reads the websites with a male voice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta the tag does not work . so that festival does not produce bugs , the X@@ SL file throws the GEN@@ DER tags . the same applies to VO@@ ICE tags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I added a fil@@ tering filter , and now I can pre @-@ return or go back . on the cardboard box orders it is displayed , the order existing only consists of one sentence . what am I doing wrong ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
inter@@ section sign ( point , question mark , sign symbols , comm@@ a and Sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) are not allowed to filter . use a filter to set the pun@@ ctu@@ ation limit for this sign .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts in the audio output . if your system counts , you can not play at the same time and start reading another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the web page of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with July 2005 , the code will not support a real breaks . if you stop a text contract in &amp; kt@@ on , the current set will still be read . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the audio program So@@ x is used for general setting of speech speed , but otherwise it is not mandatory .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you &amp; kt@@ on , use , check first whether your voice syn@@ thesizer works correctly . follow the instructions you have received with syn@@ thesizer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the festival is one of the best free TTS syn@@ thesizer , which source code . the quality of the voices is generally well structured , and there are multiple voices and languages . with many votes , you can adjust volume , speech speed and pitch with &amp; ct@@ ts ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need to install at least one language . let &apos;s help you in instructions that are supplied with festival , you need to read the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these voices , you must comp@@ ile an additional module , therefore you need the source code from the festival . German voices are subject to restrictions on passing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this voice is set to run 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early stage . do not pack the software in a festival / lib / Vo@@ ices / rus@@ sian / . if you are able to set up the rus@@ sian voices ( 8 bit ) encoding as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux , distri@@ butions . are you looking for festival first to see the CDs of your distribution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the coding required to be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding should be set to 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ r@@ illi@@ c as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Festival can be used together with the mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ syn@@ thesizer and then takes over the audio output . the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; program and the mb@@ ro@@ la ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; not a complete voice output system is . &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; generates the software from Di@@ ph@@ on files . you need additional software to create this de@@ phone . you need to generate these di@@ ph@@ on@@ e. required Di@@ ph@@ on@@ e. tx@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also be generated from German texts th@@ phone .
with this process additional wra@@ pper Code will be added to the festival to use &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; vote for voice synthesis . note that the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; files are not installed in the folder / lib / . instructions below
I@@ MS German festival is a modified version of festival for German &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; voices . either festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; then download the MS German Festival
instructions can be found in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E package that you have downloaded . ( for use with festival 2.0 the import@@ ation of error correc@@ tions not require you only need festival ) . then add the following lines to the file / lib / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Festival Lite is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff voice syn@@ thesizer that currently supports only a limited number of voices and languages . with this language syn@@ thesizer does not adjust sound height , volume , and speech speed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fl@@ ite is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . locate Fl@@ ite as first on the CDs of your distribution .
H@@ adi@@ fix is a two @-@ stage syn@@ thesizer which works with Di@@ ph@@ ons . the program tx@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o transl@@ ates into the sound . language quality is good but the support is currently limited to few languages . you can set voice , pitch , speech speed and volume via kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr .
load at least a german language file from the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; page and un@@ zip it with un@@ zip in the folder / us@@ r / local / mb@@ ro@@ la .
copy it tx@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c to ~ / .@@ tx@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c or after / etc / tx@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o , this must be removed by the r@@ c at the end of the file name .
on the card selection setup selection select a voice and set the paths to &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; and tx@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o properly .
ep@@ ox@@ s is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff language syn@@ thesizer for the Czech and Slovak langu@@ agues . it &apos;s a simple language syn@@ thesizer with still sufficient voice quality . with &amp; kt@@ on ; you can only adjust the volume with this syn@@ thesizer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the card card , you can add the Czech or Slovak language and ep@@ s TTS . if the ep@@ ox@@ s programs are not set in your PAT@@ H . enter the path to the programs on the card box . enter in a &amp; console , ep@@ s -@@ h or say -@@ h to obtain further information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Free@@ TTS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff language syn@@ thesizer that is written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; virtual machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; you can adjust either pitch or volume speed .
the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ on ; with any language syn@@ thesizer that can be controlled in a &amp; console ; on the command line .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; best , use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wav ) instead to send the output directly to the audio device . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this hand@@ book explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , a module for the system interfaces , which allows the management of network interfaces , the routines and the DNS settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the system contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a unified , integrated surface . the &amp; stand@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ Centre ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been developed to enable the users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way , as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf . create a simple surface for the following tasks : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after installation a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center is displayed . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ) can be accessed by selecting the network settings ( net@@ work@@ conf ; ) .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware can not install yet . physical devices and their drivers have already been fully installed and configured to enable the device to display and set the network properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in most cases driver for network hardware and other devices will be installed on the Inst@@ alling &amp; Linux ; installed and installed , the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files , according to the kernel version . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the module network settings will be loaded , if the option is selected to detect the network settings in the system Settings , and automatically detect the used platform on the system automatically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the platform cannot be recognized , the manual selection is offered . by selecting the setting not @-@ again question the definition can be met permanently . by selecting the network settings , this selection can automatically be set automatically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . in advance all options can be previ@@ ew@@ ed but the change is not possible . in the system management mode you will not be able to change the password mode . it is required to enter the password mode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three riders : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tab network interfaces is used to manage the network units of the system . all available network units are displayed . from the rider network interfaces you can perform the following tasks :
you can set up the defined network interfaces by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button ... to set up the device .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the desired settings dialog to enlarge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server for any system startup , therefore no further settings required . in the selection list either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP mode can be selected according to the system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the selection Manu@@ ally can be made without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP which can be used TCP / IP address . in the input field IP address the sub@@ net@@ mask is set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the initi@@ alization is not desired , the system is initi@@ alized if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the values entered in this dialog will be displayed as properties of the device in the device .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it should be ensured that the IP address within the network would not be used . with ping into an existing IP address , you can determine whether the required address is already in use . in doubt , the administrator should be asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on demand , network devices can be enabled or disabled . switching on a network device is enabled by selecting from the list and clicking on interface .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on demand , network devices can be enabled or disabled . after a activated network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speci@@ fies the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ net , which facilitates physical connection to remote networks and is used as default to TCP / IP communication with machines in other sub@@ net . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the computer is more than one network interface , the interface must be selected to the network where the gateway computer is selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name due to the appropriate IP address . if the computer is calling only IP addresses , the DNS suff@@ ers from this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the calcul@@ ator for the nam@@ ing resolution of the rider name resolution enables simple management of this list . entries may be added to remove or changed m@@ ed@@ .@@ DNS entries can be placed in the list with the buttons and down to the list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by clicking the button to add ... out of the computer to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will add the name of the new nam@@ eser@@ ver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and select the button Add . the entry will then be inserted in the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the host computer to nam@@ ing resolution , select a entry and then click on the button edit .... it will be the editing dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of known calcul@@ ators describes the name @-@ to @-@ IP address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily when bo@@ oting using DNS servers . in small , closed networks it can replace DNA servers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normally , the list of well @-@ known calcul@@ ators contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses will not be replaced in the future version 4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
give the IP address of the well @-@ known computer and click Add ... The New Ali@@ as dialog will appear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter the name of the well @-@ known computer and add the button Add several Ali@@ as names , add the button and add several Ali@@ as names several times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
select an entry of a well @-@ known computer from the list and select Edit .... The dialog for your computer will be shown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be done one of the following tasks , then with clicking OK , the list of the static hosts will be updated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings used in the module network settings are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes , the following commands must be set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the homepage from &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net is available from which you can download the latest version of the source text .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) , it is enough if &amp; K@@ DE are installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the installation of the pre@@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it &apos;s easy to download and install the rpm package ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical interface like k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE are sufficient , but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and other things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only recommended to experienced users . it is however not difficult , &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , to comp@@ ile . the following commands should afford . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information on basic networks will be given in the second are all described by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf . changed configuration files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this area can not replace other knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endix only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is provided .
there are currently IP networks operated using TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never expected large distribution . from IPv6 it is expected that it is currently concentrated in the near future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most important information is to assign the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; workplace is the network administrator to apply DH@@ CP . in any case , the IP address can not be chosen arbit@@ rar@@ ily ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when setting up a small ( home ) network the IP address should be selected from a special place reserved for this purpose . addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet ; therefore any use is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gat@@ eways . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for smaller networks , addresses are usually used in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 calcul@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the power mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so all machines are in the same sub@@ net . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ 3 ; .0.0 and 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard Route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 network address is reserved for IP traffic in your own machine . usually , the address is assigned a lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this section , the configuration files based on &amp; net@@ work@@ conf are affected and where they are stored in different distri@@ butions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this file will sometimes be dynamically changed with DSL connections , so it is not surprising when in case of active DSL connections to find another content as set there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is revers@@ ed by the scripts in Su@@ S@@ Econ@@ fig . a different standing can therefore be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with the creation of new variables , changes will be made only when the c@@ ron@@ tab has been stored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to cut a variable , select the variable first . go to edit them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to copy an environment variable , select the variable variable first . go to edit copying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the variable and select copy , or press C@@ tr@@ l ; C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to add an environment variable , first one needs to be cut or copied into the clip@@ board . only then the option add to . select the variable -@@ folder . then proceed to edit inclu@@ sions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to change a variable , first select the variable variable to create ... select it with the right mouse button on the variable , or press C@@ tr@@ l ; O .@@ It then appears as described above , you can edit the variable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to delete an environment variable , select the variable first . go to edit Del@@ ete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to enable an environment variable to activate or de@@ ac@@ ti@@ ate , select it , and specify the state with the menu item Edit . if a de@@ activated variable appears below description below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , you can also click the variable with the right mouse button . make sure that the name and value of the variables can be displayed correctly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if all tasks and environment variables were changed or changed , you still need to store the c@@ ron@@ tab . select the menu item Save . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , you can press C@@ tr@@ l ; S . changes or additions to tasks or variables are then active . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it appears the standard K@@ DE ; pressure dialog . if you select valves , see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options available in the printer dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; print the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users , the extended auth@@ oriz@@ ations have . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cr@@ on . for example vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command c@@ ron@@ tab to change the timet@@ ables of the user .
a PO@@ SIX @-@ compliant and UNIX ; for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands of &amp; UNIX ; to learn time and date .
&amp; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; &amp; dat , a backup programme for band drives on the basis of t@@ ar . it offers the opportunity to create several archives . the first goal was to answer a question that my wife continued : how much longer does it take when you are secure ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before a band can be used it must be done by &amp; &amp; dat ; it can be done in three ways :
&amp; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; &amp; dat , the tape goes back and reads the pre@@ st@@ ressing of the band . recogni@@ zes &amp; k@@ dat , asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recogni@@ zes &amp; k@@ dat , the pre@@ f@@ ann , searches for the matching index on your record . can &apos;t be found , if the index index is new to be created . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything went smoothly and does the icon for the band drive to indicate that the band is involved . the content of the belt can now be searched by fl@@ aps of the tape for the band .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before dis@@ card the ban@@ ker , first the integration must be solved . there are three methods to do this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; &amp; dat , there is a modification of the symbol for the band that the integration has been solved for the band and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before a volume of &amp; k@@ dat , used ; it needs to be format@@ ted by &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a band name must be format@@ ted before you can use to store data . this process is not necessary to form@@ atting a tape before use . Flo@@ ppy Disk Dri@@ ves can usually set a form@@ atting of the tape , DA@@ T drives on the other hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after entering the band name and the capac@@ itor , the volume goes on . all data on the tape are lost ! after completion of the form@@ atting process the tape is automatically connected and is ready for use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you push the backup process , you need to select the backup files . that can be done in three ways : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select a file or folder in the local file tree , only this file or folder is secured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mark a safety profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
mark your files in the local file tree with a tick . just the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are secured .
click with the right mouse button on your local file tree and select the backup menu on ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the backup has been opened , the dialog will open for backup . in this dialog , you can even check the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you have confirmed the settings , the dialog will give up the progress of the securing process including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mark a file or folder in one of the archives in the record for the drive . it will only be checked by the selected file or folder .
mark the files in one of the archives in the record for the band with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry ....
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the audit process has started , the dialog will appear for checking . in this dialog , you can check once your selection and change the working folder for checking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you have confirmed the settings for veri@@ fying , the dialog will examine the progress of the audit process as well as data throughput and the remaining time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you can manage the restore , the files that are to be restored , must be selected in two ways : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select a file or folder in one of the archives , which belong to the index of the tape . it is only restored to the selected file or sub@@ folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mark the desired files from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are restored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the right mouse button , click a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu bar .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the recovery process has started , the dialog will appear for recovery . in this dialog , you can check once your selection and change the work folder for restoration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you have confirmed the settings for re@@ covering , the dialog will be retri@@ eved . this dialog shows the progress of the process and the time passes and the remaining time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sometimes it proves to be necessary to create a band@@ index file based on the band content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of tape :
you can create a backup job profile with the currently selected files and default settings . you can adjust the following settings for a backup job profile :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current working folder , where the backup should take place . the list of the files will be updated automatically according to the chosen work folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all folders that are listed under backup files , that only the files can be secured emplo@@ ying on the same file system , which can be stored separately on the same file system . every entry is considered by t@@ ar independent from the others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
carry out an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup file it will only be used for a snap@@ shot file . only the files can have changed since then .
the name of the file which is used to determine changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snap@@ shot file before calling b@@ ar . this causes all files to be secured and a new snap@@ shot file will be created for the next backup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; files ; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the settings can be set up via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ jection variant of the tape recorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is this setting active , transm@@ its &amp; dat , before the tape is connected to the drive . in some drives this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the option is enabled , &amp; does &amp; dat , it tries to lock the tape drives . this option does not work with all tape drives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the option is turned on , it is automatically thrown off the tape . do not use this option on flo@@ ppy stre@@ amer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the option is enabled , try &amp; per@@ dat ; not all drives support variable block@@ sizes . not all drives support variable block@@ sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you need to &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case you need to share your belt size .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if &amp; &amp; dat , a band format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only take a flash block on the tape . the contents of the file will be summar@@ ised as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is the same name : seconds , where the name of the full name of the system is format@@ ted on which the volume has been format@@ ted since the era has been format@@ ted in seconds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this purpose , the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the remaining files on the tape are pure t@@ ar archives , which can manage directly with &amp; GNU ; even other t@@ ar versions should work , as long as it is not about incre@@ mental backup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
check the contents of a backup cover . this symbol is only active if a band is involved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; ks@@ lice log ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; viewer can not know where you can get information about your system , or where the system enables quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; ks@@ ystem log ; helps to understand what your computer is in the background . the task of the protocol @-@ files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can not know where to get information on your system or where the system is stored in the different protocol files .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , operating system log enables quick access to information about problems which occur on their server . &amp; ks@@ lice log ; therefore tries to provide some advanced functions of certain programs being filtered and analysed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; ks@@ lice log ; a number of useful functions . among other things include :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; support for many different types of log files , for format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and sam@@ ba format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , many other functions are also included and are explained in other chapters of this manual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you can see in the following screenshot , features &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; functions available , with which help the individual protocol @-@ lines of a protocol file can easily fil@@ tering and sort . the individual options for sorting and fil@@ tering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the start &amp; ks@@ lice log ; at first the most important protocol @-@ file of the system - the system protocol . will you not start using Linux normally in the folder / var / log , for the normal user usually do not have permission to read .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you may also use the filter console in order to filter the selected filter line . in default settings the list of the log lines will be displayed automatically , so the list of the log messages will be displayed automatically when in a column contains the string of the filter pattern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can select another entry at this point . for example , you can only select the string of the filter keyword which shows you the name of a process , so copy &amp; ks@@ lice log ; all protocol @-@ lines that were sent or created by this process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this option is enabled in the default settings , and helps you to see the key protocol lines . the colored input of protocol @-@ lines can be switched off @-@ off setup dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to create a particular process ( e.g. in the process protocol or in the cr@@ on protocol ) , you can evaluate the process identification ( PID ) in the column process how you want to scan the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter tra@@ ys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , you can enable the option to check new lines in the main window will display in order to display all new protocols on the protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; allows displaying multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to open this function , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage the number in the menu , select a protocol for displaying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; ks@@ ystem log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / ks@@ ystem log@@ .@@ Forum @-@ soft@@ war@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find further information on the source sources of &amp; ks@@ lice log ; .
&amp; ks@@ lice log ; you can also find in the following folder of the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Subversion archive : ks@@ system log ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; - archive
welcome to &amp; K@@ DE ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . this section guides a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; K@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the V In@@ it system quickly develops into the standard for control of program boot when driving the system in the &amp; Linux world ; and so , because it &apos;s easier to use , more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will not go further to historical aspects here ( among others because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is why anybody could try to take a machine on System V In@@ it , without a re@@ installation and new form@@ atting . so you need to make sure that old In@@ it removed from there , if there was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SY@@ S@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it , that the configuration files are in a sub@@ folder of / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d. D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following further folders : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole amount of scripts . basically you will need a script for any system service that you do not include such things like network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; and htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc . system services does not include such things like set@@ serial that will belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be lying under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems own this file also if you do not want to add a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something out when driving with a serial port .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kernel is searching for different positions according to the program in@@ it , starting the first one taking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the default run@@ level is included in / etc / in@@ ad@@ ab . you should see a line as the following :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , you can edit a glance at the second column and likely notice that the default is done , then you can fix it if you restart the system and execute the following : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but how does it start now all the right scripts ? when you enter -@@ l enter r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you &apos;ll probably see something like the following : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will notice that in this folder no real files are located . instead , each entry is a short@@ cut to one of the scripts in the directory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how does and stop in@@ it actually system service ? very simple : each of the scripts is written so that there is a argument , as start and stop . you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the K includes , the script will be called up with the argument start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people want to set up a simple way to set machines for many purposes . I could &amp; go ; a server run @-@ run ; , network &amp; etc ; I also could have a user -@@ Run@@ level ; , network &amp; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , you learn the use of &amp; cryp@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was as user @-@ friendly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or other index device is simple to say not tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry in the field of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to stop it at this level ( or stop stop ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can change scripts even between Run@@ lev@@ eling or change the position within one level by doing so elsewhere , this will only happen if they draw an entry in the range of available system services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : entries are moved , if you want to copy them to a new file . to copy them to a new file , you will need to copy from the menu or even if the same entry has previously existed in the target range . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sorting number of a single entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must modify the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries , before you can try to paste the system service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : currently there is no way to restore entries , which were thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . be careful , careful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can use the tab control to activate the various work areas ( available system services , run@@ level 1 stop , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to meet a selection top or below the previous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move an entry in another run@@ level , move it into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to change the sorting number or the name of a single entry , press the tab -@@ button to accept the changes between various fields , or press Es@@ c to dis@@ card the changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the risk of data loss all entries in the menu will require confirmation , before they are executed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all settings are saved in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . def@@ aults are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ D@@ ED@@ IR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) . otherwise it will be saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . otherwise . changes to the pre@@ ferences are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been experim@@ ented with the Standard Run@@ lev@@ i , and now the machine starts constantly . what can I do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter the L@@ ILO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single use mode , then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ex and modify the default run@@ level at a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be right ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution running at run@@ level X , but they will not be executed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are using Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the species , such as system services to be launched in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies the configuration for proprietary instruction programs of these distri@@ butions , but corresponds to no standard . the authors of &amp; K@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; schedule an extension of the program for this approach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you are a different distribution : please check if all configuration files are available which are required by the respective system service ( and also whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; htt@@ p@@ d ) are easy without message when your configuration files are not present or incorrect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the importance of the &amp; Linux ; Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this manual may be added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this documentation is based on &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adap@@ tion by &amp; Kitt@@ user ; to read .
