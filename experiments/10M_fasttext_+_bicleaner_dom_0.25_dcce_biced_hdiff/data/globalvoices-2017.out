&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love to America is extraordinary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , I &apos;ve grown up American music , read American writers and operated his sports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indeed , this country had such a profound effect on me that I mainly became a journalist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican Let@@ ters who wanted the Supreme Court with Jud@@ ges , who were inc@@ lined his interest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; free to Method Man , &quot; I was like being the absolute truth , forget all others , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the year , which I lived in Arizona , had only strengthened my admi@@ ration for the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always said : &quot; America is the only country where I ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you are and it &apos;s easy to find acceptance in a community of equal people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had even written a very narrow letter of love about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much was written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his asc@@ en@@ sion is to me how he is going to die with his clas@@ sy .
he never has his mind behind the mountain as you says so beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says that he thinks how a former colleague put it , and declar@@ es his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ ino , Af@@ ro @-@ American and women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , people responded to his statements and tuned in dro@@ ves for him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 13 million voices , which he won with the Republi@@ can election , was the highest number ever reached by the Party nom@@ ination candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was speech@@ less .
who are the Americans who supported this big@@ ot person asked me ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I could not mount Tr@@ ump and His voters with the people , which I had met in Phoenix during my time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , taking people from around the world , a deep believ@@ ing human being talked with me about Islam and its past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Tr@@ umps also voted for the world of view by Peter B@@ ha@@ tia ; the current publisher of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ quir@@ er &quot; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ha@@ tia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours in order to watch the Phoenix S@@ uns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump In@@ toler@@ ance is also in contrast to gener@@ osity which I experienced at Sandy B@@ ahr , which I fought for her life and her husband Dave , my host family that treated me like her son . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it still fits to the commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es who helped me with much patience and grace , and my colleagues helped us to get used to the complexity of American life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then Andrew le@@ ak@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise counsel was helped me much with my career . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people and those em@@ bodied in em@@ bodied values deep@@ ened my love for America .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Tr@@ ump his way to the appointed rep@@ ubli@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counter@@ part of his limited vision of America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 8 November 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly White , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps because of his contemp@@ t towards non @-@ white people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the discussion with the idea that people had agreed for drinking - because they either shared their rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , because they were ready to over@@ see these things , almost immediately broke my heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe it is un@@ fair to refer to the Tr@@ ump voters as the R@@ assi@@ sts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to sort the people , one of my friends , is exactly what has led us to this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is superf@@ icial and resp@@ ect@@ ful and suggests a in@@ ability to understand those , which are acting in a different way and think . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it shows people that their wor@@ ries and fears are not considered , about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could it be that these voters want , of which most of them are tuned for Tr@@ ump , because they want control over a country that has disappointed them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in other words , they wanted to say that they are still important in this country ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps maybe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it can barely mention the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comm@@ ates the cruel decision to rise a man who looks back with contemp@@ t on those who look different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( note that the White against all other Eth@@ ics ) ; &quot; as regards the White and Wor@@ lds , what is so much that the great Van Jones called , exactly what America did so magnificent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether the myth or reality , it is a powerful idea - which faith or background you may ever have , America is welcome each welcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this country chose his President twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose story as he himself says , anywhere else in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the choice Donald Tr@@ ump , however , a huge part of the white America is a promise to say , &quot; Hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole not@@ ion of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the USA after 9 / 11 , the white man is at the helm , they say . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he did at the eve of the election . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at a rally for H@@ illary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , had my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crowd answered with a loud &quot; no ! &quot;
&quot; could Muslims have a place in your US ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd began .
&quot; do Lat@@ ino have a place in your US ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered them .
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they called them and their voices were lou@@ der .
&quot; could anyone who is not so is like you a place in your America ? &quot;
he received an unanim@@ ous and powerful &quot; NO &quot; !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan ended with words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the land which his son dropped , he sent him a message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s Tr@@ ump Land now said the message .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan could find no more place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca in the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of Cat@@ e@@ ura ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the music that is played at both places , not only the lives of children , but also a very close link with the ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located at the edge of a large garbage dump only 16 Kilom@@ eters south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; but from the nearby pre@@ mate ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for several years now the La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Music ban@@ de ) plays a symph@@ ony orchestra which consists of children and adults , an opportunity for over@@ coming poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a music school with 100 pupils can become the central interest for the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the municipality , located in one of the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces Mexico , is known for its drugs and ban@@ anas violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this changed after an acci@@ dental encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project , and the youth managed such a rare hope . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the young band members take their comm@@ it@@ ments compared to the music group very seriously ( the local press not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI ) :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to follow their great passion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they will always be laugh@@ ing and playing with shiny eyes , play trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , bon@@ ke , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
music from Wa@@ ste
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 7.000 km south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village where lies practically on the biggest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ on in Paraguay capital - on instruments that are made from recycled waste material : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; music with re@@ prepared instruments , made from local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura where the recy@@ c@@ ler has begun to transform parts of the waste in instruments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ i , c@@ elli , contra@@ bass , guitar , fl@@ utes , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion which were all made from tra@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the repertoire comprises classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ sian and Latin American music as well as music of Beat@@ les , Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Chávez rec@@ alls a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , at the beginning time : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first it was very difficult because we had no place for rehear@@ sals and we had to teach in the same place , that the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact their parents because many of them cannot live with their children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something that he never had seen before , a violin made out of waste . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , there is a whole orchestra which performs on instruments from restored materials and identi@@ fies the recycled Orchestra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a documentary modified by the &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) shows the musical output :
the world generates about one billion tonnes of tra@@ sh each year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who live with him and of him are the trouble - like people in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspiring spectacle of garbage @-@ to @-@ music around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the orchestra was even played before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how to combat technology and team@@ work on illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this post , written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , published in a magazine that specialized on international , practic@@ ing solutions for environmental issues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the re @-@ release occurs as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to collabor@@ ate on content .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already been operated by illegal fishing in the country before it visited the other coast of Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the East African countries were thus appropri@@ ated and low inc@@ lined , a bill @-@ break@@ er of this kind to welcome their co@@ asts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the compres@@ sors , Mozambique and the Seychelles mobili@@ zed quickly against the ship . they refused to exp@@ el any of their har@@ bours and refused to share it to him a fish@@ eries approach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , the Premier is surrounded by countries that would simply refuse all , &quot; says Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior executive of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it did not succeed in catch fish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , for pill@@ aging of fish stocks of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the core of this initiative , which protects crimin@@ als and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 from the N@@ RO Stop illegal fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing stop ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides Somalia and Madagascar , members of this network are six countries apart from Somalia and Madagascar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like and work together and join each other when it comes to illegal fishing . &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts Project En@@ ding il@@ legally Fishing . this project gives F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is regulated by definition un@@ regulated : what is being caught is conc@@ e@@ aled when it is extremely difficult to detect . so the illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing from regions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain habit@@ ats and species are to be protected , can have harm the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems which have a delicate balance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but while actions against illegal fishing were once addressed through bureaucra@@ tic hur@@ d@@ les , and by the s@@ nail speed , these actions are dealt with in real time , trace@@ ably at F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the individual countries can exchange or share any lists of existing licenses or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port spec@@ tra@@ tion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships even very attentive to move these at the open sea using satellite data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this makes it possible to mark the authorities , ships to mark involved in forbidden ground - such that they suggest that a ship invites its caught fish on the road to other ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideally , these studies can show whether the participating ships have a default license where they were traveling and possibly also whether they have a criminal law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; countries that are against illegal fishing can be denied by the acceptance of such ships in their har@@ bours , which means that the ships cannot be sold their cargo , as in the case of the Premier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is then about considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that the illegal fishing is finan@@ ci@@ ally not worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , executive director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is an advisory firm aiming to fight illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the already mentioned platform was created to reg@@ ain about 20 million USD in lost sales , which lose eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year because of illegal fishing that penet@@ rate the East African waters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
East Africa has created one of the most productive tuna fish plants all over the world . amongst those illegal fishing boats from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among its practices including campaigns are like sailing under false flag , f@@ ake licens@@ ing papers , speci@@ fying imagination , fishing in protected species and fish in conservation areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from the lack of international cooperation and the weak@@ nesses of a non @-@ g@@ il@@ fully organized control system says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I could say , &quot; You should not run my port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; and exactly this legal conclusion was trying to close F@@ ISH @-@ i .
so far the closed front works .
since its foundation F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 studies susp@@ ects ships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has un@@ discovered criminal networks , which had counter@@ feit licenses in Tanzania . discovered ships which used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has found volati@@ le ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to its co @-@ operation with Inter@@ pol , the international authority to fight crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing through great distances and received . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system that is intended to help F@@ ISH fair to precise ships precise .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which will continue to be developed , also helps to remove the illegal ships that would like to hide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the illegal fisher@@ man use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Head analysis at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at Tracking , an NGO which also offers technical support and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the ships turn off for example their automatic identification systems , with which they cannot be ort@@ et by satellite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cop@@ eland , therefore , helps to build a system that combines various information systems . it &apos;s supposed to help find crimin@@ ally ag@@ eing ships with greater precision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team African countries actually have influence on this un@@ question@@ ably global issue of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos : President of the NGO Sky@@ Truth believes that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened with Google and the marine protection organization Oc@@ e@@ ana the platform Global Fishing Watch : a platform that provides satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by means of the position of each tracking ship worldwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the neigh@@ bors to get a better picture of it , who knows what where does - this is simply sense , &quot; he says . &quot; here is a chance for countries to un@@ ite and bund@@ le their resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts run a similar project , in which a global system allows the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only feel crimin@@ als but they also scre@@ ams .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ships , which were un@@ exploited previously without license and hardly have to reck@@ on with consequences , know that they are observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participated in F@@ ISH @-@ i have now bought a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries sales , ever since fishing boats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped , Gre@@ ko 1 found the insp@@ ectors there on board tow networks , whose use is prohibited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is strong that we now also copy other countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are an object of study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars annually disappear by illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are six countries together in 2015 , at the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . also they fight out the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; more such initiatives and structures are also to be created in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s ma@@ ke@@ over entered Somalia &apos;s first great triumph : in October was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship travelling under false flag . and not only was the ship travelling without license and have been banned by now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also reserved in forbidden waters which were reserved for Fischer from Somalia . &quot; with the Take of Con@@ duct against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing . &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time Emma Bry@@ ce works as a freelance journalist and lives in London . it works on environment , technology and nutrition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of fierce demonstrations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a protest against the decision of the government , the referendum on the chairman of the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the government of Venezuela on a referendum on a referendum , the Veneti@@ z@@ ol@@ ans responded to the negotiations on the political and economic crisis in the country by trying on the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the return of Venezuela ) , both pictures and arguments can be found and against them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the debate is also led in other parts of the country , among others in the low@@ land region of Bar@@ ran@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , located in the central north of the federal state Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on the Isla Margar@@ ita in the state Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the political and economic situation of the country has wor@@ sen@@ ed itself , causing a acute lack of food and medicines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental shift in the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but ultimately , the holding of a re @-@ election was blocked by official authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises in their latest articles the context of government decision :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % of the annual financial statements and in which the only way to capture the country to conquer its institutional structures and con@@ serving a new government of government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral alliance of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Diam@@ r@@ á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( about : round Table of the Democratic unity ) , which led to the president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro as well as a march for the support of the National Assembly , which continued to continue on 27 October . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call was commented on Twitter as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is far Venezuela : in the morning National Assembly , Friday national military , and on November 3 all Caracas to Caracas to the Mira@@ flo@@ res palace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the first demonstration in the programme of Action &quot; The decline of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday 26th October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among others , the pictures of the marty@@ rs , which are published in real@@ time , bear witness of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also disputes with polic@@ emen as well as advoc@@ ates of government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most frequently shared pictures shows a demonstr@@ ators which calls through the protective plates , &quot; You shall kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Twitter , images that tell disputes about disputes , and reports of repression and abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially big waves beat the news of political suppression in the central north @-@ north village of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from there , demonstr@@ ators moved back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement before the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hours later , they could leave the cathedral safely , but the protests continued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police , including these women in the An@@ den@@ state T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira don &apos;t wear a skirts , because otherwise you can &apos;t see what many national yar@@ ns have not ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile a info@@ graphic is already doing the scale that forms the degree of suppression per day :
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many representatives of the government had ques@@ tioned the validity of the demand for a minist@@ erial approval process - this was now shown in the eyes of many people through the presence of countless men on the road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others consider these protests as a further step in the fight against a government that has under@@ gone a little against the devastating economic crisis , which would rather be concerned with critical voices : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they took us so much - but also the fear !

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some Veneti@@ ans reported to the media , they were hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or shopping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an adapted version of a interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argentine news page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the interview was translated into English and published here with kindly permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced to visit the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentine province of Córdoba . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now served as part of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial in the province of Córdoba against his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were examined during the Argentine military dictatorship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not sought his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; starting with the guarant@@ or of the same name as his father is to carry up to the brutal military battles in the prison of La Per@@ la , which he suffered enough in the age of 15 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for 34 years he held the family sec@@ rec@@ y .
at that time I believed that it was fine .
I felt like a secret mag@@ ician .
as a child of 15 years it is not noticeable that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I couldn &apos;t know that my father was a th@@ ief , Fol@@ terer and th@@ iev@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was gendar@@ mes . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , his father was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 in prison La Per@@ la . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , op@@ press@@ ors , who is accused of ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in nearly 100 cases and the ab@@ duction of a 10 year old child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who had witnessed the extent of the atro@@ cities which he had witnessed as a boy in the course of the years , and he said before a Federal Court against his own father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his story shows that great power has a parent , and how this child has chosen a way of redemption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went with us into the sports hall . there I was wounded with a boy who made mar@@ tial arts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo , and called me to identify my friend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole ; you &apos;ve got yourself with one of the ERP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they merely believe that they will not take you one day , and I will save you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for Ej@@ ac@@ ti Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo - a Revolution@@ ary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party in Argentina .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is why he offered me to go back into the sports hall . several days later , he took me back to the military base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said to me I would be secret .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was 15 years old , and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for so , my father had moved to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the base of the military I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were all possible documents : college doors , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda amat@@ eurs , books , simply everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&apos;@@ da some of the prisoners are tor@@ tured . &apos;
my father took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he took me the second time he commanded me to get off . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he gave me a little badge for a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great cl@@ ump of silver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen objects were shut down and kept myself with a guard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
suddenly he pointed at an open space and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw in , and saw a song that tor@@ tured to people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it looked like a field bed and met@@ alli@@ on springs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later I found out that they mount the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person , which was captiv@@ ated there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they captiv@@ ated a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ cast him with water and pursued a charge of 220 volts to the gen@@ itals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the sten@@ ch there it was irre@@ plac@@ eable ... like a dirty winch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; years later , when my Father was under house arrest , the same od@@ our came from his room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I recognized the smell right away , and I realized that the smell of a body in need is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could never forget that smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself , How is it possible that a man can do so much suffering from another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ I knew that these people were killed &apos;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he brought me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and buried him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z , a civilian who was also charged in the trial ) and I used the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the background , I saw a series of matt@@ resses where bare people were facing down , and were bound up on hands and feet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the vicinity of the entrance people accommod@@ ated quietly on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when my father observed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; Why do you look so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I denied &quot; Why have you brought me ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and buried by soldiers and buried .
I know this because my father told me about it .
next to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra there were some rooms that were designated as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero &quot; struck a man there and killed there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( according to information of survi@@ vors , Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also indicted in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , to death at the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the director of the Memorial La Per@@ la , leads through the former fol@@ k@@ chambers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the way where you came here , is also the way where we came here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at the map , see that they took about this path and then tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their names were changed , and they were given a number assigned to the process of withdrawal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement of the above was that they should be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the lie - the Euph@@ em@@ ism - for the shot of men and dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &apos; war yield &apos;
my father brought all the all things taken with home .
at that age I had no idea what the &quot; spo@@ ils &quot; - as they called it - was .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when I was later in the military , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear to me that the yield is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps a military sign which one fights an enemy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you go into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... be chosen , then that is not a war yield but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is the theft .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always asked me how my father , the head of security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t understand it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also an officer at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house , and steal all of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t understand how my Father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a crime , and I answered : and you , whom you hit the street on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a crime ?
he explo@@ ded rage and hit me and cried :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you go so far , then I will find you and embrace you yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need no other than that !
that was my father .
I have no only good memory of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo from then on which I wore a jacket and a pul@@ ley of wool . I had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not poor , but he brought clothing with home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , the defence accused me of being a con@@ j@@ urer about this crime . I suffered no problem , they can lay up with the burden to me what they wanted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was anyway to say something .
&apos;@@ the dis@@ appearance of the body is the last horri@@ ble act &apos;
now that I am older , I am fle@@ eing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have children . if you first have children , you recognize the value of a life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one is developing and recogni@@ zes that it is false to kill .
I went even so far to say :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , you were ex@@ et@@ ted during the dictatorship . but why the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why do children kid@@ nap ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one day my father brought a girl with her home , whose mother had been killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was like our pet and almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I was asking myself the question : they were tor@@ tured but why were they killed ?
they could just have put it into prison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I reck@@ on , it was simply decided to kill those people , but why should their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
had these people not even families to bear their mort@@ al rem@@ n@@ ants ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ appearance of the body is the last horri@@ ble act , which one can do a man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my father told me when democracy was introduced , they fet@@ ched machines to eliminate the mort@@ al rem@@ n@@ ants of the prisoners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were gr@@ ind and no idea . no idea , where . &quot; one will never find something , &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but anything else remains forever .
&apos;@@ I saw how you killed people ! &apos;
only to clear it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just have said the truth about 20 criminal crimes - including my father .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thought , to view my father , arose during a conversation as he was under house arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I made him worth@@ iness for all of the atro@@ cities that I had to experience in his account .
then he said : &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have killed anyone . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt sorry about it and asked me , for what the whole super@@ charged patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , who were allegedly dra@@ fted , really good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me something about me ?
I saw how you killed people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have committed a horri@@ ble crime , and you forced me to join with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he only encouraged me &quot; Na then to me . &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 I received the first ad .
I had finally recognized that he was a criminal .
no one can imagine that I am pre @-@ taken . I finally said against my own father .

the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the Spanish order of reas@@ oning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera del concluded his crimes committed against 7@@ 16 victims in August 1978 and December 1978 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

eleven of the accused died during the trial .
# La@@ per@@ la@@ judgement : murder , torture and rape by counter@@ parts . # Es@@ co@@ ster@@ ror@@ ism
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the def@@ endants were members of the military , including former military personnel , former polic@@ emen and civil staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piero De Mont@@ i , together with his pregnant woman , was kidn@@ apped and brought to La Per@@ la in June 1976 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ humane heads .
the Court of Justice is a historical milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked on justice for the victims for years .

the trial took more than three years but research took 39 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ inian government presented the country on which La Per@@ la , so that a memorial was established , which is now led by human rights organisations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

one translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; terrible drivers &quot;
the sign with the translation error in a center in Kyoto where you can extend his driving licence .
the photo was widespread in the social media .
processing of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre where one can extend his driving licence for the last month of a very special translation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a shield , the Japanese word , which means that &quot; older mot@@ orists , &quot; means - perhaps also with ar@@ mo@@ ist backgrounds &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; terrible drivers &quot; translated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the wrong translation was read from 1 to 20 September on electronic displays in the lobby area , and in the building itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subsequent adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which is often divided in social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the error was the translator Julian Holmes , a resident of Ky@@ otos , who was the local newspaper on it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the daily newspaper Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could I get to such an English translation ?
this proves that nobody has read the translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto , just un@@ acceptable , &quot; said Holmes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the original English translation was first removed . the term &quot; not@@ hing@@ ness &quot; ( german : &quot; aw@@ ful drive &quot; ) was later replaced by a reasonable period of current circumstances ( german : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) was replaced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pre@@ f@@ ecture of the Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture , ap@@ olog@@ ised for the translation of translation . furthermore , they explained that the translation had already been sent to the translator and that the translation was not checked upon their correc@@ tness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a blog@@ ger reported as follows on the exc@@ use :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sin@@ cer@@ ely sorry that older people felt thanks to the in@@ adequate correction ( the translation ) on our part , &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ cast News continued with the phenomenon of &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; aw@@ able &quot; was denied as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the share of older drivers who are involved in accidents , but are definitely concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , in the Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture , in 2005 1,@@ 9@@ 41 from a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors . that equals a share of 10 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors 1,@@ 80@@ 3 from total 11.@@ 850 accidents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this increased their share to 17.@@ 7 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the number of accidents dropped in total , the proportion of sen@@ iors induc@@ ed accidents in the same period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the af@@ e @-@ mentioned repor@@ ter brought in the text of the article comments to the light that show which pre@@ judi@@ ces were to show some Japanese drivers against older mot@@ orists :
the article on Yahoo about the translation was given by the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; terrible driver &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
- &quot; So the translation is not actually wrong or ? &quot;
- &quot; I do not find that this is a real translation error . &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so common in all of Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout the whole of Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true mine for these bizarre bugs in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of translation defects are mani@@ fold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to transfer two key skills , you need to know a passive learning knowledge in order to understand and active the language knowledge in order to transfer him into the target language . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter requires the active master@@ ing of the target language - something that is in pron@@ unci@@ ation of the pron@@ unci@@ ation . in general , the belief that trans@@ lators should not be in the language of the native language . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a French native language should translate for example from English to French ; not the French into English .
photo of Flickr user Karl Baron .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many Japanese enterprises do not employ workers in English as the mother tongue , the translations into English . this may be due to lack of translation , cost reasons or the relatively low number of English native speakers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some companies that have no foreign employees either have been finished , have translations , whose English knowledge will be written down to translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo of Flickr user Karl Baron .
machine translation have also been widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the distor@@ ted and brow@@ sing phra@@ ses , which can result by machine translation , show that this technique can &apos;t be replaced without a human trans@@ lators . this applies to some languages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the most strange English verb@@ aliz@@ ations in Japan , including the brow@@ sing e prints , often used T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not read or understood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo of Flickr user Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; translation errors may be still acceptable or at least harmless , but by major companies or by the government to guarantee higher standards , you can expect more carefully translations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a mal@@ ign@@ ant source of their translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and c@@ ens@@ ors to take action on the Internet and TV
the main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ al con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free Surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to P@@ ren@@ sa y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ elan Internet user used it no access to the online transmitter Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , other users wrote the internet performances of V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV as well anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other online channels were also hosted by protests in Caracas , which were organized by op@@ position@@ ist groups that res@@ ett@@ led by the government Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court dis@@ b@@ anded the Parliament and transferred the tasks of the Parliament to the executive branch and the Supreme Court itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he showed that the connection agreed to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to access the internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
# Z@@ ensu@@ r : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet sites Venezu@@ elan Provider has again been locked .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ated by protests in 2014 on the reporting of protests . at that time , the Commission threatened to report them against the demonstrations , as the Commission continued this as a call to violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have registered for @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net without cable TV and informative national television channels .
amazing that this is still cheaper than to buy two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the local NGO VE@@ in@@ fil@@ tro confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by a locking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also concerns the National Assembly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
earlier research of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) - a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , have y@@ ielded that the local Internet vend@@ ors sometimes even use certain domains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds or ref@@ uses the request to call on such a website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ et@@ oli@@ ot@@ v ; @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third locked channel , the transmission was closed on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V @-@ camera was Elvis Flo@@ res who bore the protests into Caracas live . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Flo@@ res was beaten , while he was in custody .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eight hours later he was released , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V was back on the show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although some channels are still accessible through YouTube , it also reported that the government is increasing the internet connections : thus access to multiple media reports on current events in the country are more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Paraguay too many girls become a slave to receive training .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the shortened version of a report by Elec@@ tor , published by Global Vo@@ ices with friendly authori@@ zation of the authors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the article is part of a series with the title &quot; Vac@@ as que &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vac@@ as que &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vac@@ as que &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vac@@ en &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; F@@ unding cows , exp@@ orting schools ) &quot; supported by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she did not live together with the family , who was allowed to eat there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly before her Gradu@@ ate School , she returned once again to the house and heard the owner of the house was full of pride . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she who has become something , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she became ten years old she started working as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . in Paraguay the more than 46@@ .000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school in Paraguay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the shop is very simple : a big family with little money abo@@ unds her younger family or her younger family . in exchange the child gets food , an apprentic@@ eship and a roof over the head . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , what is not mentioned here is that the children cannot pay for them countless days , which will never be paid and victim of abuse and abuse - and all that in the context of a contract that you can not lift up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this practice known as Cri@@ cht@@ az@@ go is widely distributed in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by major parts of society and in spite of numerous complaints of human rights organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a couple of years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she spoke about Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as , especially young girls affected by the practice of the Cri@@ cht@@ az@@ go - accumulated witness accounts , resear@@ ched and ref@@ ill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tried to name things when she name , because the feeling of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated , will not stop talking in general . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , the family that will close their daughter in the belief that they continue their training to improve their position in society and can make something out of himself , to another family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the family , which assi@@ mil@@ ates the girl with her , and jus@@ ti@@ fies that they would give someone a chance who would not get any training , and perhaps even star@@ ved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the girls are mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will be experienced only many years later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sometimes they never know about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the hidden in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen households , but a face . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín in Ca@@ agu@@ ac@@ ú came to hospital , her body showed foot@@ steps . shortly afterwards she died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military family Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o who works as a cler@@ k at the population register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mar@@ ín was living in its house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3.000 inhabitants , 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira hit Mar@@ ín for a while until they suffered fatal injury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of young girls .
some days later the media reported on the incident .
they con@@ cre@@ ted that the murdered child was Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela went in charge of the pro@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen society of the Cri@@ cht@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
they recorded the cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dozens of people came to protest agreements , asking that &quot; no further Carolina . &quot; in Paraguay will give . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widespread in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children . &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a is compl@@ ained .
without papers it is much easier to harm the rights of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without official documents , it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the neighbours of the marriage , and nearly 60 civil society groups demanded a smooth examination of the case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o , for the murder of the girl who had been sentenced to 30 years in prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the case comes from court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be a landmark , if the case for the first time in history of Paraguay is a case of cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go ahead of court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as are not only exploited as labour power ; they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , in which her father worked , had to reti@@ re , and her father lost his job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their brethren only had to work , and began to sell on the street or on the market sweets to earn money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ on as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
in the house of their employer Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a operated between four and six hours each day .
in doing so she had to divide the time for learning as well .
it stood at five o &apos;clock in the morning and booked the breakfast for their employers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , they puri@@ fy the fridge , clean the living room , polished the furniture and the infected ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the school was over , she went home again and had time for learning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more time they had to learn with learning , the more leisure had it had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also this time was limited because they had to have dinner for their employers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says that she never had to hunger , but I didn &apos;t need unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the house than food from the fridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the host , a former military and sympath@@ is@@ ant of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party that was in power from 1954 until 1989 , was belonged to the Opposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some evenings , the host of the house Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a to stand next to him and Editorial , such as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo &quot; to read . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , he tried to persu@@ ade her reports from the official media on the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was indeed for intelligent , but not with her . &quot; the landlord had found someone who heard while speaking about politics , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I often did not permit me to visit my family , because they thought that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í to back home their mother tongue of Guar@@ an@@ í . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , her was perfectly clear that she had paid for all that had paid by them with their hard work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was also discri@@ min@@ ated in school . &quot; one thing about which nearly never talked , are bul@@ lying and the ch@@ ic@@ ans to which Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as are exposed to school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents are Cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was able to invite anybody to me home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my youth , at the time where friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly evident that I belonged to not a group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook Group where you can share employment for cleaning personnel and nur@@ ser@@ y in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

starting from Monday if possible .
the ad had five &quot; listen@@ ers &quot; and many comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one woman from the site Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a el@@ f@@ ary girl , and gave her phone number . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another woman who came from Ñ@@ em@@ by also offered her 15 year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children , and she wrote very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the third comment was written by &quot; a girl from the country inside which I want to work . &quot;
then the author turned again into the display :

bill for Egyptian social media writes down social media to register with the government
image of Pix@@ ab@@ ay . changes by Global Vo@@ ices .

sixty Egyptian par@@ liament@@ arized European Parliament recently voted &quot; the draft on the use of usage and usage of social networks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it is adopted by Parliament , people must register social media in Egypt with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , then a place would be set up which is instructed to share citizen and citizens with a permit to share social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within six months with the adoption of the law , people would need to register with their right names and identity numbers in order to use social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it failed to do this , this could have a punishment of up to six months of imprisonment or a fine of money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bill , which consists of six par@@ agra@@ ph@@ s and in local media , defines social media as a &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application that runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video editing and text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is un@@ clear how the law is established when it is assumed , as the draft is not able to prove that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure the regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Abdul Satt@@ ar , the author of the Parliament , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a username and password from the telecommunic@@ ation Department . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that may mean that Egypt plans to judge a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of those , it would be necessary to submit information to their identity to access the network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not known so far that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical regarding the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ram@@ y R@@ ao@@ of , Senior Research Technical Engine@@ er &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Human Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative &quot; for personal rights ) , &quot; Global Vo@@ ices : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I branch strongly in technical capacities and understanding , neither authority in Egypt , regarding things which have to do with technology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my opinion , they imagine that as they are violent physical public and private rooms , it could also be done online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I take it seriously , this means that they are able to do a strong monitoring system to filter citizens and does not mean a mad system to over@@ see the activities of human beings and to assign it to a court process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be approved as a law , the draft must be deb@@ ated at the legis@@ l@@ ature of the Parliament and the constitutional committee before it enters the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether its acceptance or en@@ forcement will be successful or not , the draft will be in harmony with a pro @-@ military mind in parliament , in whose senses it should be fully present and ensured that no devi@@ ant s@@ nar@@ ration is present on the image area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says R@@ ao@@ of . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ ha@@ w@@ y , a Legis@@ lative Templ@@ ate against Cy@@ ber @-@ Crime , was found guilty of &quot; public order to thre@@ aten the public order &quot; and &quot; to protest to protest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this post by To@@ dd Rep@@ bold has published in the original on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environment solutions . the post is published here as part of an agreement on Content Sharing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
high up in the mountains of the region Kurdistan in the northeast of Iraq workers are working the animal conserv@@ ation@@ ist H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and their team from scientists of the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq to protect the vacc@@ ination of Persian le@@ op@@ ards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a sub@@ type of le@@ op@@ ards that w@@ anders through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ard ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus Alto Min@@ or ) . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat , because they always find less loo@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why is this specific type of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; is the Persian le@@ op@@ ard the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the preservation of the ecos@@ ystem itself also depends on that a large pre@@ dat@@ ory is present . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in fact in the wild , is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore noted that it breaks through a large cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks in pure joy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a trained Bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a also enjoys a different side of their country , which is not only made up of war and conflict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been involved in field studies on wild animals for six years and involved in education programs by Nature Iraq .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group , and is committed to providing protective zone for wildlife in the Kurdistan region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in early March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o was documented in order to revi@@ ve the life of those which was killed in the last six years . an enormous earthquake , tsun@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had triggered the disaster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai - the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i is the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsun@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring countries of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to ev@@ acu@@ ated all the coastal cities of the map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still experienced a nuclear accident . 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o shows out of the local vision which progress made six years afterwards were re@@ build in order to restore the local life .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both the Japanese re@@ construc@@ tional authorities as well as survey results of the suffer@@ ers themselves .
the housing situation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper is reported that by December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the plans had been completed in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to record the biggest success under the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were finished here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses ; whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima joined 70 percent of the end light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even six years after the disaster , about six years after the disaster , ev@@ acu@@ ated of mak@@ eup , cas@@ c@@ it@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) re@@ exists in final replacement homes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following the triple disaster , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in the living area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in December 2016 , 36 000 people still lived from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate in such co@@ operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost 40 per cent of the Fu@@ kus@@ hima still living in shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was still more successful . more than 75 percent of ev@@ acu@@ ated by the disaster had been displac@@ ed , were res@@ ett@@ led in final houses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for I@@ w@@ ate the number here is 34 percent .
of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools have been hit by mis@@ fortune , which opened its doors to December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of schools of three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures were more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while almost 100 per cent of fish@@ eries in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now back in operation , in Fu@@ kus@@ hima only 30 percent of F@@ ish@@ eries were res@@ umed their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tsun@@ ami and the nuclear accident occurred in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land very much moved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of the farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unlikely that this is only a result of the nuclear accident , as only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed land@@ land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , are lying in the nuclear strike zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures the tourism has recovered largely , but Fu@@ kus@@ hima still remains a far off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back up to 90 percent on the same stand as before disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hima , on the other hand , only 75 percent can have . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal places , it is more difficult to earn their li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the local population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to determine the overall picture , the newspapers conducted numerous surveys on the native population and among the ev@@ acu@@ ated people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she ques@@ tioned about the state of the revival , as well as their recommendation from the tsun@@ ami risk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their introduction of the article the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper explains :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o led a survey to bring more about the tsun@@ ami consciousness among the native population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures taken in order to be prepared for the future earthquake and tsun@@ am@@ is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents say that there are still not enough affected in disast@@ ers prevention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how it stands to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in her edition on the anniversary of earthquake the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung ob@@ tains its attention also to the situation of ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hima not only had to see the great earthquake and devastating tsun@@ ami , no , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , no , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of nuclear accidents when Japan had to experience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , almost 63 ,000 people were moved in areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of 2016 there were a little over 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima in permanent surro@@ gate houses had been res@@ ett@@ led . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the state of 2017 , 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live outside its home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the catastrophe areas most ev@@ acu@@ ated are the most ev@@ acu@@ ated persons , older than 50 years old . they have to compete with massive construction projects for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world is small : our Podcast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when people meet people from other countries who speak another language , the differences seemed to be greater than the simil@@ arities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a while , however , one often sees that one more links than it seems at first sight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these global connections are important , since they expand our pre@@ judi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global links . in our In@@ to the Deep Podcast we treat topics that often get less attention when they deser@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 has taken place this week in the intensive care unit : last Friday a police officers had struck him at a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . nationwide millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest against austerity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , suffered a brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doctors managed him this Saturday , and have now moved him into an artificial coma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his condition is considered critical .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , who spread quickly in Brazil within a few days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the pictures , the face of the police officer is also identified by a percussion cane . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian federal state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had suspended until the conclusion of the pre @-@ active service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pictures show the police officers as he performs at Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his bat@@ on to the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( Photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would a police officer checked by a prot@@ esters and landing on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the whole suppression would be justified with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Facebook page &quot; Dis@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , distributed the video on the net in which one sees how Mat@@ eus attacked by the police officer and several sanitary blocks immediately to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another video of the same scenes , but from another perspective is also filmed in social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the clip below you see the attack on Mat@@ eus starting the 50th second .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in a different state , Internet@@ Manager has donated 10,000 Brazilian Re@@ ais to cover a part of the costs for medical treatment and allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia during the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil in which there was a brutal police station on demonstr@@ ators last Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , demonstr@@ ators put a stage for speakers in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where prot@@ esters had a stage for or@@ ers , rubber bul@@ let and tear gas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) , asked the police to refra@@ in from violence against prot@@ esters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once again the Brazilian media liter@@ ated by the media , by di@@ stru@@ ed the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and est@@ ado de S. São reported specifically about a bro@@ bro@@ ader glass window , to form a photo of their cover pages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the O Glob@@ o preferred a song @-@ story with a m@@ ega @-@ set bus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window disc than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special thing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have to acknowledge that if you are strictly against any form of damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also here the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; receives a absurd , disp@@ ropor@@ tion@@ ate meaning and the typical violence of the Military Police will tu@@ cked through the &quot; demonstr@@ ators on confron@@ tation with the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the youth of the de@@ ar@@ isation of forgotten villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the works of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso almost hundreds of sugar cane mills in Cuba had the doors ( Photo : Julio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the popular community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich is located in the Western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - known how there is no significant sugar di@@ lute on site .
it is two years ago when the activities in sugar cane mills were paraly@@ zed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the suc@@ cum@@ b to the sugar cane industry , the sugar cane industry remained silent and the factory lost its facilities until the s@@ caff@@ old remained in steel and concrete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about 27@@ 2 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other re@@ signed and comm@@ utes daily to the factories , which still ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an who is open every day at 4 : 00 a.m. ; the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he heard that in the east of the region sugar cane mills , which are back in operation after a long in@@ active time , because they were received . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene rec@@ alls exactly to have heard that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved but the promise was not held .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sugar cane industry has already with@@ drawn the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , low market efficiency , lack of decision decisions and climate change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 production was 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than half produced in 1910 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message would have been a motive for the land some decades ago , but the bad yields have already been no news . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane force turned off ?
the old railway tower of the church already saw better times .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cr@@ ushing of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane mills were technically out@@ dated , and hardly ever competitive , they were un@@ sustainable for the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initial idea was to focus on production to the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they only allowed the factories left to produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives which lead to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane sugar and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless the sugar price rose again about a decade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from 2017 through 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must be between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the OECD and FAO , the Agricultural and Nutri@@ tional Organization of the United Nations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar exports would generate roughly $ 85 million for the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day , the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro ren@@ ounced during his speech at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o during his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on the process of restructuring in the sugar industry started .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following years , a total of 98 sugar cane mills , over 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for continuing education . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same happened in the sugar cane plant Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when N@@ ene , as a soldier is known , is known about the closure of the factory , the word that he is repeated the most , &quot; fraud &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
so the place received when they had a full time - Working Group .
before the first year of drawing the first letters began to come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was officially written documents that would only be removed regarding the parts which would be removed , the Mail@@ sat and the date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all were signed by Ul@@ re Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister made any withdrawal .
from then on the responsibility of the responsibility and the letters came more frequently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the finished factory two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money , &quot; he as@@ sures the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for the retirement in another facility called Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was in charge of his will at the shut down of the factory , whose construction he helped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with any portion he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 working years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the industry &apos;s best developed industrial sector and most important wor@@ kt@@ ops has been ob@@ liter@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in many cases , no alternatives for the jobs and services that were generated by the municipalities in which they were created . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will never know if during the Mamm@@ ut speech of 21 October 2002 , the former president in the eyes of the present persons saw that the factories were no longer in operation for five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane mills
since 2004 sugar cane is only extracted by Mah@@ len .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after two years the popular community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the sugar cane factory was closed or better , when they began to lose her , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ y the road , dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without working in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to search other factories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were replaced to spare parts .
also many young people left the region without the prosp@@ ective prosp@@ ective prosp@@ ective in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area a food factory was created , whose production does not even serve even for the supply of the community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new facility is still imposing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began working . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty yields to the old soldiers a pension of two thousand Pes@@ o per month , to reti@@ re for years in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a tra@@ geous person , nevertheless , he gives the lies that they told him not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have been crossing it for ten years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ene is over 65 years old , not because it is missing by strength , but because he is bitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

first Nations young people use Hip Hop to express themselves and to maintain their own culture
recording a song of &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gra@@ ssy Nar@@ rows First nation .
photo used with permission of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
young people from the First Nations communities in all of Canada deal with themes that are important to them . they are done by hip @-@ hop thanks to a number of touring workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an tour has been bringing mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres in order to accommodate youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original workshops were led by the educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in Northern Qu@@ é@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then worked together with the Cre@@ e Hip Hop Group The North@@ stars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the workshop rises with the fact that the young participants performs in convers@@ ations like &quot; cultural identity , speech , meditation , love , self @-@ acceptance or whatever to them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos where the young@@ sters are the main actors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and were invited to organise similar workshops with the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state Neb@@ ra@@ ska . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this video of school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First nation in British Columbia are telling the history of the highway 16 and also called the highway in West@@ kan@@ ada , where almost two dozen women mostly disappeared or murdered .
the cases were mostly not solved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next video of Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First nation uses the motive of a video game to con@@ vey a traditional customs and customs of war , despite the influences of glob@@ alisation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of the songs were published in indigenous languages , although the young@@ sters are unable to domin@@ ate the languages of First Nations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First nation was recorded and the refra@@ in is sung in Cre@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the young@@ sters received a little help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from North@@ stars hip @-@ Hop , who gave them a crop in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the st@@ anza is at your disposal as well as a translation into English which is translated into German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sometimes I feel like I would be interested in me .
but I still try to walk my days on Earth
that &apos;s the day you will exp@@ ose our cry
because we have lost our way in life as a youth
but I believe that we will rise to one day .
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and lead by our youth .
that is how they can do what they determines the creator .

in Japan plastic dishes are not only exhibited in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( appoint@@ ments ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan one can see almost every restaurant of plastic dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to show potential customers that are exactly on the menu , are exhibited in the proximity of the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( appoint@@ ments , &quot; Plastic models of dishes &quot; ) of any food served in this restaurant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; customers will see these plastic dishes , and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is an entire industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district there is a large number of these small businesses to produce those plastic dishes , which the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a above 20 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for most Japanese they are these plastic dishes so usual that they do not even stri@@ ve them anymore . a new trend , however , is turning into striking mobile accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
near Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome the blog@@ ger it@@ ini@@ i published various social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin soft pur@@ u .
now on special sales : new plastic @-@ wrapped mobile foil producers will be shown at the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u purchase house .
many of these artificial foods were transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects like in this case , fridge magnets :
here are a couple of sho@@ ots for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in ess@@ ences is becoming increasingly complex .
in this case a ka@@ ak @-@ don ( a popular dish with seafood ) has been turned into a mobile stand .
for these three @-@ time bowl ( lo@@ l ) we have found a good use as a mobile stand .
also this part we made for the Tokyo exhibition .
and here is an apple that can hold your cell phone :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is a great design . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is just the beginning from an increasing flight into the Comic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some mobile support and mobile designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura or salmon have been used , a popular t@@ opping , which is served with white rice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several users had their doubts on Twitter :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is there somebody saying that &apos; Wow , cool , now I can betra@@ y my mobile phone with salmon ? . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less adv@@ anta@@ geous form to surprise for example colleagues or family members .
our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of mel@@ odic ice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and hand bands from dried salmon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
further sk@@ ile plastic dishes you can watch under : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow CWT on Twitter to the h@@ ash@@ tag # 9 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you like to learn more about the origin of this trends , this video gives you an insight into the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi city that addresses the supply of the restaurant industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes can actually be produced .
a Mexican project tells stories of living fighting against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug re@@ ta@@ iler . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media on the not@@ orious &quot; struggle against drug traff@@ icking &quot; in Mexico , the missing and killed were regularly reflected in statistics . however , these mirrors are not reflected in the extent of the human tragedy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reporting on drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the boss of the Sin@@ al@@ oa cart@@ el , dra@@ gged the stories of the conflict totally in the background . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the sorrow or to the churches that have learned to live with pain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behind every ser@@ che , behind every bone tunnel in the hundreds secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , their wounds , and their wounds , may never cure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why the Mexican news portal Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ tico has called the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with drug traff@@ icking live &quot; ) and stories of people told in the struggle between the prosecution and cases of cases .
Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organised crime does not only fear us to fear our life .
the effects are much profound .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , when shops are threatened because they are threatened by drug hands , and all municipalities have to drive many kilometers to buy some times as milk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pain of the victims
a video using the title &quot; Vi@@ das &quot; c@@ ambi@@ an p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear lives &quot; ) tells the story about these stories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who looks for every weekend secret graves to his son . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who lost her father &apos;s father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ew . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; like every Sunday we prepare ourselves today for the task we tried to go and go to graves , after the people we loved to search . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never met again . Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children that need a training . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is also my mother , who is also here with me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the moment it has no income .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are the insurance of my father &apos;s insurance , but one doesn &apos;t pay them out , because they require a death certificate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
where should we get ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ a &quot; Vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t just have to show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB &apos;s a writer of Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ tico wrote this post from Tax@@ co . in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central mex@@ ico .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their contribution reminds us that one should never consider violence as normal , no matter how they appear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have been acquain@@ ted with Disease and Sen@@ sa@@ tions journ@@ alism for some years now .
I come over daily newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the cover pages with images which actually can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or out of experts .
it brings me out of the version .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , I feel as if I am the only thing that fri@@ ghtened or sad . it acts as a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot possibly be in@@ different or considered normal .
she writes on :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks that he is great . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the off@@ ences when they go through the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me it is , as if they have lost those who have lost someone and those who are afraid , that something happened to them as well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I see our weakness when stories to mere numbers will be in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crime pl@@ ess@@ ness of man is incredible for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearances of 43 students in a neighboring village , they were justified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they are trying to speak of these trage@@ dies , if they are not stirring and silent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the main city District : &quot; it describes how armed crime month was thrown out of their store until they had destroyed the store by the end but also their family apart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you think of everything you have lost and remember how many people can change your whole life in just a few days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pain in this never passes the trau@@ ma , the fear comes up again if you are alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
habits have changed , telephone numbers also .
just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the more we are apart from each other the better .
she graduated her words with words :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to be arrested some others , for you don &apos;t know when they will kid@@ nap you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I asked myself in these terrible days , if wines were asked for my deep root feelings , but the answer is no , for I have forgotten how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with pain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the post &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence done . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in introduction , he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who has been killed by organised crime ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how is it possible to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age whose parents take care of them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Br@@ yan is a f@@ ather@@ less and he tells you to teach how to make a egg , potatoes br@@ ils , tor@@ tillas warm , and ch@@ ich@@ i . this is his name for preparing the bottle with water , sugar and pow@@ dered milk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tells about nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy , which consists of violence and that had to learn to live with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother disappeared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this was not the day that his childhood ended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his childhood was over two years earlier , when he saw only a few blocks from his father who had been shot by armed men from a car passing by armed men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when Br@@ yan was born the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence merged with organised crime and fighting against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders based on civil safety and the government of the United States government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 alone , the Public Prosecutor were numbered 3@@ 103 Mor@@ des . this corresponds to 8.5 Mor@@ den per day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are just some hundreds of thousands of stories , leaving the organised crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate the soul of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only a few stories still live in view of the new head@@ lines , but this project reminds us of those who we are not allowed to forget . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ing a Vi@@ vi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ tico launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the factor check is important at a moment when it comes to opp@@ ose rum@@ ors , or un@@ mask a f@@ ake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but how is the years having emerged for the first time ? content in social media , whether it &apos;s true or un@@ true , to continue to exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
let us take this photo of a terrible disaster seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since its first publication , it has been widely used to support trage@@ dies , which actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this false p@@ airing of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - deny the fact that there are abundant coverage about events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however it raises questions about our desire for pictures .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 , a tank @-@ van stopped the place San@@ ge in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te and explo@@ ded , 230 people died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the civil war , Africa was negle@@ cted and ra@@ v@@ aged for years . the streets in the region became dangerous blocks , which were difficult to drive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
trag@@ ically fell victim to the tank truck .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shareholder representatives described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses including a cin@@ emas nearby which was full of people looking for the soccer world championships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
houses burned and burned cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to ignorance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; - My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident are the grey scenes of this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
top is an example for this .
there are rows of char@@ tered bodies that are j@@ ump@@ ed on the ground while they are looking at .
but here the story doesn &apos;t open its end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the years the same photo was deceived on social media , blogs and other platforms , but acci@@ dentally ad@@ mitt@@ ently attributed to events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 Bo@@ ko Har@@ am attacks the remote town of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
ey@@ e@@ witnesses reported dra@@ stically by atro@@ cities where they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and body were burned in streets and bus@@ hes .
there were reports according to which 150 to 2000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed but no one stayed back to count bodies , &quot; said a inhabitants for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were thrown and shot or burned .
only by satellite pictures the follow @-@ time could be depicted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the army point in Bagh@@ dad had been a permanent conflict between the Military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt at Bo@@ ko Har@@ am ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and here , the picture from the DR Congo again emerged as evidence of the fact and the potential extent of the attack was presented : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is Nigeria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place in Paris two days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , this mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of false attri@@ butions ; Africa Check has been documented to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in all these cases the picture was taken as proof of mass econom@@ ies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another step further bring personal comments such as this example , according to the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to supply arguments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image from San@@ ge came to Myanmar in Myanmar , together with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a flash message issued by the United Nations , those who could flee from stro@@ kes , rape and several dead , some by burning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while others reported on violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following , presented these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this picture was taken by a aci@@ di @-@ Arab news page , which in 2012 claimed to have participated in the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition she had used the painting from the DRC in order to address this information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original contribution , which was last opened on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other news organisations , the AF@@ P as their source , had also attributed to Th@@ an His fact , but had not related the picture from the DR Congo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the worldwide range of false information
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traces of these wrong coupling cuts back to the year 2011 and 2012 , and actually come from all over the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using a &quot; reverse picture search , &quot; one can see how far information limits be exceeded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a reverse picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 billion images ( as of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 images which are very similar to the mentioned image from the DR Congo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they come from a mixed mas@@ ch of private sites , platforms social media and collabor@@ ators as well as national publications and are in many languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some have re@@ directed wrong reports that have been temp@@ ted to un@@ mask the for@@ geri@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have seized the examples of the ab@@ u@@ sive use and linked them to the respective countries , based on what page they were published . thus we want to represent the range more clearly than by the language alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the countries listed below ( which in some cases have also been linked together ) , several examples of mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous use may come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some cases that can be felt completely split ( on the map in orange ) :

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the native countries refer to pages or servers , over the examples of fal@@ si@@ fiers or fal@@ se@@ ments are still available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the countries in grey are examples , according to the metadata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also sample studies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Malaysia , 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Malaysia offers two extreme examples for an ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo , and on the other hand the attempt of a B@@ log@@ gers , the alle@@ g@@ ations , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persec@@ uted , as the photos of which have been ab@@ used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Myanmar - 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government of Myanmar published a judge on how &quot; deliber@@ ately printed news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , attemp@@ ted to create mis@@ understand@@ ings in Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this right position , which exclusively appeared in English , also includes references to counter@@ feit pictures of sm@@ ells that kill H@@ ate speech and vice versa ( which is often widespread by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this post that addressed to members of the Russian Orthodox community , clearly sees that the picture of the DR Congo is NO Muslims to kill the Christians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this news page claimed that the president of Myanmar Th@@ ein being celebrated in 2012 , that mon@@ ks and politicians have participated in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image from San@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the article was updated in 2014 , and the publication is still included in this release . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this article of 2014 over students that were killed by the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am , published by the Kath@@ olische near the K@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly been explained that the picture is not from the sounds , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar d@@ jihadi@@ st attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the picture was put into circulation by the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 , the paper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te it in Nigeria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture of the DR Congo , provided with this wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , issued a discussion among Muslims following the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am massacre and the Tu@@ esdays at Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they wanted to achieve those of these events , who took place in the name of the Islam@@ s in the name of the Islam@@ s in the name of the Islam@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
United States 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture was d@@ ashed as proof of the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am massacre ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times saved ) , but the messages that were connected with them were in no religious context . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , the objective was to focus attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media coverage in comparison to Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vietnam ( Vietnam@@ ese ) - 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a message that allegedly was written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Pascal &quot; over the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , we translated the discussion forums , like this here on Vietnam@@ ese and explained it to the ho@@ ax . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the message in which the picture was contained in the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ iner Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Pascal had dis@@ soci@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are further confirmed examples of er@@ ron@@ eous use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) are also not fully trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time / dat@@ est@@ amps exist on the craw@@ ler and link them over image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all these cases , which appeared only clear after the original accident of 2010 , the image probably bears a correct description , but the original fee is not available or appro@@ achable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
frames and pictures
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two strong themes , or frames ( frames ) through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the photo was used in regards to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the assassination of Muslims and - for the defense of Muslims - the assassination of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a second Fra@@ ming uses the picture to discuss , how an African life is under@@ valued in comparison to European or French life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religion do not want to understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth exploring how images can be used in connection with these efforts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a deeper question is what happens if readers cannot give these images longer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with social media , there are zig people who have an un@@ intended proportion to clou@@ dy the water around a tragedy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggests this mood of false and false information , the actual atro@@ cities are in@@ true and nar@@ rowing the real hor@@ ror from what is actually happening in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the spread of peaceful images has been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one argument is that res@@ etting images of a ref@@ usal to recognize the tragedy . at times , these pictures are even required by the victims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , concern that non@@ violent pictures and spectators can des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ ze and emp@@ athy the ability to emp@@ athy ( for example , this study , investig@@ ating how non@@ violent media seem to influence others ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while there is a lot about non@@ violent represent@@ ations in the news media , fact that they are essential for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; techn@@ ologists experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . you will have thoroughly suggests about the situation , in which a picture may suggest something out from the context or to completely ab@@ u@@ sive manner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
any examination of false supplements should be considered as internationally as internationally .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g un@@ ce@@ able ) endeav@@ oured to offer language fans a selection of words around the world , which are difficult or not to translate at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such words exist in every language : they express specific situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these un@@ ce@@ able words are already well known today ( such as the famous Portuguese es@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture , such as Spanish so@@ lic@@ ea ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but all resi@@ sts stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one word or expression is not enough for a complete explanation , and sometimes necessary some context to understand what is meant with this one word . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these unique words were collected in an online list for all the time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist made by &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the blog you can find for example words from V@@ anu@@ at@@ u V@@ anu@@ at@@ u as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - paint your parents to recognition , just as having endeav@@ oured to keep you in your younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and words in H@@ uns@@ rik language that are spoken in parts of Brazil as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after being dar@@ ed in the sun in cold days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they s@@ ne@@ ak other cultures and reveal other thoughts of ideas and wake our curiosity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes influence how we analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page would like to show more of these &quot; un@@ ce@@ able &quot; words , and show how diverse , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or@@ ators of &quot; Treas@@ ure Languages , &quot; which are highly appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

like Sri Lanka with the worst floo@@ ding of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently the worst floo@@ d@@ water and disaster in this decade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mon@@ soon caused by mon@@ sun , usually in late May , are caused by strong rainfall the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , N@@ il@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya through the south and west of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following a statement of the disaster of Sri Lanka on 28 May 2017 , 126 men were killed and barely hundred people are missed due to floods and mud floods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) , approximately 100 000 people have been brought to 304 safe stay of stay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rain falls on Saturday , May 27 , AD and some areas in some areas were slowly coming back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
health and hygiene conditions of the population constitute a massive challenge in the affected areas and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following images and videos con@@ vey an impression of the degree of flood disaster :
floods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water stands of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am For@@ ms and Sri Lanka are providing regular updates to the flood .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods wor@@ sen the Den@@ ver crisis , the Save the Children , after some further ra@@ ins are already on the way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today the nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in the flood with water level of up to 6 metres . Mor@@ ag@@ da village was also floo@@ ded with gendar@@ mes of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a yesterday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Air Force has made five air@@ planes for rescue operations , and further five are made for transport of emergency deliveries to the residents settled in their floo@@ ded villages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
various organisations and Star@@ tu@@ ps are also willing to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od V@@ IC@@ TI@@ MS in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka do important information regarding flood @-@ life and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams require d@@ ron@@ es for their operations please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .

we are today in the area around Kel@@ en@@ i@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks for people to share their location data using the app , so that the risk centre will be informed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year after the disaster of the trop@@ ho@@ ur@@ ms Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me led a &quot; flood remedy &quot; button to call it a car to pick up assistance and donations . these were then forwarded to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similarly , they introduced a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button which had more than thousand questions and 150 successful bo@@ unding activities planned by floo@@ ding water and land@@ slide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , during which several social media platforms have fully exhausted , will bring people in safety and afford assistance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has prevented the loss of other human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way ahead of rest@@ oring norm@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use of the t.@@ Dam@@ as in January , I participated in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love friend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I trusted you my four year old daughter , she tru@@ sts me her children , she is my rock in the surf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the one minute we call par@@ ole for the rights of women .
in the next step we en@@ code rights for trans@@ forming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are located in a sea of umbre@@ llas and people , some keep an iconic image of a woman with head@@ scarf high , bound from an American flag , other sk@@ inn@@ ed slo@@ gan@@ s against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my friend is looking at me , saying , &quot; These things are not related to you , or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I already led these entertainment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people , with whom I work or people who have been working for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar , who has built it - from the far @-@ spread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; that has set up in her concept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t see all the same .
we practise our religion differently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we identify with that , to be a Muslim , to different kind . but somehow we are all connected to the same Muslim drawer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drawer is well designed in our collective concept , that as soon as Muslims , who do not adapt it , must be mus@@ li@@ zed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be reli@@ eved
I am not alone with that alone .
the poet has even happened to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which images come in a sense when one thinks about him ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as J@@ al@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox mus@@ cul@@ ate pre@@ acher and schol@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam , the Kor@@ an and Prophet Muhammad was up to the day that he died , the center of his poetry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the western show , religion was deleted by Rum@@ is , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this del@@ etion makes a big part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims from this world .
another difference is in the reduction images of Muslims who has been colon@@ ized by Western books for centuries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark man , which one should fear and the exotic woman , which you should save . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pione@@ ering Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid recorded the story behind these paintings in the 1970s , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but these pictures continue to figure out today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continued .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I worked for thir@@ teen years in the news industry and I have seen such powerful , fla@@ w@@ less nar@@ ra@@ tives domin@@ ate our news@@ feeds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this nar@@ rative clou@@ ded reality , which in the last three decades , nine Muslim women have led to their countries , while the USA could not even choose their first female presidential candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this nar@@ rative fails to recognize that if French , Muslim women are prevented from carrying their head@@ scarf in public buildings and cover aci@@ di @-@ Arabic , Muslim women by their government to cover its entire body , which are both sides of the same coin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a powerful group performs his &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong nar@@ rative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it looks over the fact that the first Muslim prayers were spoken to American soil from Afri@@ kan@@ ers , who had been brought to them with slave ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer @-@ Muslims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this nar@@ ra@@ tively has created our collective imagination deep and er@@ ron@@ eous , that often S@@ ik@@ h men and children become target an@@ tim@@ ental attacks and ch@@ ic@@ an@@ cies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to these stories , that we speak and because of the way we speak , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion
in the news industry we do more than just tell stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create s@@ nar@@ ra@@ tives which help us to understand the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and my industry has failed to record it , the nar@@ rative of the 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we are here failed , where there are seven million Muslims living in the highest degree &quot; various &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African Americans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six of ten American Muslim Brotherhood belong to immigration of the first generation , coming from 77 countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four decades ago , my parents came to New York to live their US dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my mother put her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue , and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made from Bangladesh by the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
back then when Khan referred to the sky@@ lines of the world were my parents &apos; sore Muslims and Americans .
but am I now uns@@ killed Muslims and American ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , when I ask myself why I am not a pork , I say - instead of getting my Muslim recipes or bear my handy hand@@ bag that all Muslims may wear - &quot; from respect of Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I sh@@ ear , we do not carry all the bags with us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also have to be a the@@ ological expert to be &quot; Muslim &quot; , or to be chosen almost always for additional security che@@ ques at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are hundreds of tremendous dev@@ ils , Muslim activists and religious activists , who stri@@ ve to fight widespread lies about Islam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these lies are produced on the ongoing band of a well lubric@@ ated , think tanks and expert for fal@@ cons which is our already faul@@ ty picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam has been manipul@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the stories , which we declare and due to the way in which we declare it , Islam@@ ism contains in more than just a stranger who leaves a woman the head@@ scarf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

I want to explain this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was born as the Muslim , but one Muslim was born only when I was four years old when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ tery church in New York . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when social scientists describe religious life , they attack on the following terms : belief , behavior and citizenship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mus@@ li@@ mic faith and behavior is perhaps not always visible , but they are there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe my girlfriend , my neighbour , my neighbour , my rock in the surf when it could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that would separate our houses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would see the all@@ ish night &apos;s ritual with my daughter , when I con@@ vul@@ se them in my arms and use the Arabic verses of protecting the Kor@@ an and the Q@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every of them I repeat three times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask therefore that it is being protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one can &apos;t see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Muslim faith is not always visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s the picture of her that I close in this moment when I close my eyes : Nano , surrounded by their finished and un@@ finished paintings , a book with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters you can almost imagine it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims to be to speak the prayers , which they said to me , if I have a bad day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims to be in it , as she taught me to refer to God : Allah is what God means , my only lord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; belonging means to grow and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time to see that my in@@ gen@@ ious grand@@ father we@@ ep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palest@@ inians , whose families were torn apart as in my grand@@ father , who were torn apart in the Muslim world as at the game &apos;s risk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims to be to know , that in the last two centuries Europeans have all up to four Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was dropped in a century above a Muslim country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means to know that at the same time the grand@@ father of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , mur@@ ky sub @-@ tan of the British Empire , described by the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous &quot; became the first mosque in England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to my Muslim tribe of the 1.7 billion , deep into our unforgettable family rooms , our un@@ il@@ legitimate history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means remember that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops that were spread over every continent being pursued by the Antarc@@ tic , in order to pursue weapons of weapons who did not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means aware that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is were buried under the streets of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one American Muslim means to know that the suicide rate among Veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means knowing that when a tragedy is the US , susp@@ ects and susp@@ ects a Muslim name , story takes four times more than a story with a white sign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means to know that four hundred years ago , the first cry of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a free black bond@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ist named named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought into this country .
it means that Malcolm X call an American hero .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the warmth , which I feel when people crossing the airports to fight against the Muslim B@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams , and when we say black life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an American woman , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim , and a journalist who has acci@@ dentally identi@@ ties Identi@@ ties but to fail to further communicate it on others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the nar@@ rative of the 1.7 billion has more possibilities than a mag@@ ician , but is represented in the reduction of arms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; being a mother means to ensure my child and all the Muslim children , well knowing that powerful and privileged persons put to establish structural Islam@@ ism in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
structural Islam@@ ism exists in the Muslim regions that began with President Bush and President Obama .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly list , &quot; which takes largely Arabs and Muslims to the visor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are the wars which we lead and the bombs , which we dis@@ card to Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the stories that we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study with the title A@@ scent of Man , scientists of North@@ western University showed a scientifically un@@ real picture and asked them to assess groups on a scale from 1 to 100 as regards evolution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Muslims received the lowest score .
the con@@ sign@@ ments we have to lead
we are too deeply involved in den@@ ying the Muslim or the &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we come back decades , recognize the roots of our fears and the fla@@ w@@ less and dangerous arti@@ prints that we headed in our news groups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims in the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten story . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Podcast Lake SO@@ ME@@ TH@@ ING , Say SO@@ ME@@ TH@@ ING , the Podcast # Good@@ Mus@@ fli@@ cker ; Sap@@ ony@@ o Square ; a initiative that multip@@ lies Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the Pak@@ ist@@ ani , Muslim , American super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned about this difficult global schedule in which we are located .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that moment has consequences that beyond 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a reason that con@@ spi@@ racy theore@@ ti@@ sts exist , which existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now the White House . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims to another . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group , which has grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally by making the &quot; other &quot; created . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few years earlier , it had not been granted ; now they are controlling major areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am concerned about the re@@ alities and history , which I was not aware of when I was so old , but now I have made my daughter to an in@@ escap@@ ing Muslim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
things I left here like a baking rack in my speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things that perhaps aw@@ aken up memories , because in all the inter@@ se@@ ctions which makes our humanity , a story may listen , where someone is made to another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right now , at the other side of the bridge in Berkeley con@@ vers@@ ations will be held within the framework of the 8th Annual conference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than a hundred ac@@ adem@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; others , &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American milit@@ ar@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , these are not any terms with which we usually throw in our schools and read our newspapers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

we all need to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do I tell this here at this T@@ ED@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who will be demonstrated to us and people were enth@@ r@@ alled by the work of the &quot; others &quot; in the public performance before four decades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to ask ourselves un@@ comfortable questions according to the role of its , conscious and un@@ aware of the &quot; others &quot; that we have not bom@@ bed a new future , while he had no president , beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

project for nar@@ rative art wants to preserve urban diversity

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can there be a way , here and now in spite of a language barrier with someone in connection ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , the tale of stories in their original language is a possible answer on it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; global Vo@@ ices reported recently over another initiative by Steven Bird , the in@@ ex@@ tual blog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve the language variety of great cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in the United States , where T@@ LS has already performed events in the United States , where T@@ LS has already performed events , not so small languages to be passed on to the children born there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the success of the project :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mass mortality of the world in the world may be avoided , if we do cities to have diversity - safe rooms where citizens must not forget , they are to be added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while listening to it often is associated to understand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , &quot; listening to appreciate &quot; to appreciate it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this format , stor@@ y@@ t@@ ellers show their history in their own language and translate them in English . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ y@@ t@@ eller , their dev@@ otion and their account will show that the listen@@ ers are embar@@ king on it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they call laughter and emotions , when the language is no longer a barrier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following video shows example a traditional history of Burkina Faso which in the language D@@ af@@ ing is explained . during this round the stor@@ y@@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou comprise the opportunity to explain typical customs of nar@@ rative art .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the Fa@@ bel of the rab@@ bit and the P@@ avi@@ an in the language of Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he explains the meaning of his f@@ ist , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked to speak to an audience which doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a broad wave , he shares his sense of in@@ fusion : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have heard !
you were aware ...
they were all with me !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling took place in three cities and organis@@ ers the organis@@ ers to expand this . all that have inspired by the project can be organized with T@@ LS in order to organize their own history of history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Puerto Rico calls for the United States to re@@ establish the sovereign debt crisis
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the aim of a re @-@ examination of public debt of Puerto Rico , some religious and bourgeois organizations involved in a mass demonstration . the march started at the pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ de Capit@@ ol , the governmental building of the capital , and went to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the Old Town of San Ju@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sum@@ med up by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( citizen front for the ne@@ ural testing of debts ) and the Italian church meeting in Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ate of the renewal of debts have also filed a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their requirement :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people of Puerto Rico demands that politicians , banks and government agencies responsible for the debt to be responsible for their corruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we demand a financial audit and a governing committee without personal interests in public debt , with a firm , our working conditions , which ag@@ it@@ ates in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are pressed and supp@@ ressed .
Puerto Rico &apos; people ref@@ uses to pay a debt that is not their own .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be cancelled with dec@@ lining pension payments .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not into the national con@@ fes@@ sion of the USA - suff@@ ers from a severe financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; is a ruling @-@ independent non @-@ profit organization with focus on soci@@ o@@ economic development , a law on state responsibility as an alternative to existing state authority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a large restructuring of state infrastructure .
measures imposed on the outside will run without the participation and convic@@ tion of citizens &apos; risk to be rejected by the people .
the demonstration was called &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Sy@@ ro @-@ Palestinian Web@@ developer Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , has been missed for over a year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and their families continued to campaign for his freedom and remember the posts that he has performed for an open net . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year &apos;s re : pub@@ lica , which is annual conference on digital culture that is aimed at the annual conference of the # Free@@ B@@ sel campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the French @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara Rü@@ hl@@ ing , Managing Director of Book Cost of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive research ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the book , which was published last year and licensed is available here , includes a number of essays , which deal with free culture in the face of op@@ pression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a tribute to bas@@ sel and its work .
in the introduction it is called :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge , and what the real cost are , with which this is related . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , designers , researchers and authors have been working on the movements for free knowledge to take over the m@@ ist , who out@@ lined our news@@ feeds and create something from our various experiences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this book is an attempt to liber@@ ate Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , dedicated to the loved and celebrated Web @-@ volunteers , which has been imprisoned since 15 March 2012 in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his name was painted by the directory of the A@@ dra @-@ pris@@ ons which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
we have no more information about its current state or residence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the introduc@@ tory section of his book with the title collective memory returns his friends and his family , who want to push his release and want to know him back in his normal life and freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to see how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for its involvement in a free culture , many of us begin to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , deeds and decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why Are We Here ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up in this process of time @-@ going extreme convic@@ tions ?
the web developer for Open Source and Digital activ@@ ist has been in custody for Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel from the A@@ dra @-@ prison , a non @-@ military institution was transferred to an unknown place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that the military police officers had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; by the military court of his prison cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ haz@@ i reported that she was contacted by Persons on 12 November 2015 , who presented itself as the in@@ sider of the Assad government and replaced it by a alleged death sentence against her husband . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his position and condition remains unknown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a decisive role to access the Internet and to knowledge around the public in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently survived the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project called Bas@@ sel , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps , nobody of Bas@@ ading cultural prototypes were better than the work which he began to renov@@ ate the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras , in order to reconstructed the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites of the world , was the way@@ cross of numerous civilians and mer@@ ges Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bas@@ sel could not know that ten years after he started working with this work , the IS was able to put all this architecture which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens , but the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this strip in digital ar@@ che@@ ology and the preservation has created a time capsule , which will be in@@ valuable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
trag@@ ically the Bas@@ sel could not shut off this project until now .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have spent my entire life with it , dre@@ aming freedom , and Bas@@ sel taught me to embrace her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call His name .
Bas@@ sel brought me English as he was already in custody .
I &apos;ve lear@@ nt to read and write English well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he always has his knowledge shared with everyone who asked . he has taught other prisoners , write English , write and speak English . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bas@@ sel has opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also taught other prisoners , as they use computer , at least theore@@ tically , without having actually held their hands in their hands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a Pro@@ clamation , which she wrote in the years 2012 until 2015 , when he was in custody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bas@@ sel and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for a year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she laid the lyrics to him when she visited him , and he translated them out from Arabic to English . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It is happening &quot; :
it happens during each visit .
that I glorify myself in the world of your enchanting eyes .
that I left the spi@@ der at the moment when we embrace ourselves ;
that any of the dangers does not matter to me ;
every of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ack@@ les and guards
I forget the im@@ pris@@ ons of prison
and I pour into every detail of your voice and words
I carry with passion for me .
if your eyes have to say farewell
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I return soon to my lon@@ el@@ iness -
to bring back all the moments ;
and on your absence to cry and to smile .
I witness myself that I will return soon ...
the first anniversary of the detention of Bas@@ sel wrote G@@ haz@@ i :
one year passes my soul
while in
I am in your cage .
and you are still in the cage of the monster
the story is not unique in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Syrian regime of Bas@@ har al @-@ Ass@@ ads , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) has disappeared for more than 65@@ ,000 people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who were arrested , or convicted by the regime , were tor@@ tured or even executed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2011 , according to the international human rights organization Am@@ ne@@ sty International died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians in detention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community calls for the release of Bas@@ sel since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , we repeat our demand for the hope that we have to do this for the last time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mozambique : due to corruption condem@@ ner head of imprisonment upon previous post
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mozambique re@@ acted with anger on a corruption , where a government member returned to work at the state apparatus in the state apparatus in which the corruption was committed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other def@@ endants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the money came from public funds to the Mos@@ ambi@@ k airports , whose Council Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a was appointed between 2005 and 2008 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a was released in 2016 for a good management and immediately requested his re @-@ setting to the company , which happened on 19 April then also . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in accordance with a position of the General Con@@ duct of the Republic given the application , there would be no obst@@ acle background for Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a to return to his old post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a lot of inhabitants are not really good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Centre for Public integrity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , an local institution responsible for public transparency , condemned the decision of the company to re@@ establish the director . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rest@@ ores the fight against corruption and clari@@ fy the absence of transparency and even a reg@@ ression regarding the efforts of our legal system , the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we take knowledge of , that also the company should have in@@ duce an disciplinary approach against the contra@@ cting trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the company was silent and caused no adequate legal steps for the application of appropriate functions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a major voice in the Muslim social media , re@@ jects this behaviour as well and considered the case as &quot; contradi@@ cted &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a would be a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half consumed them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could keep paying lectures and motiv@@ ating speech@@ es he could consult and his image polishing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has agreed to re@@ integrate into the company which he helped to bring damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore it &apos;s obvious : Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a will be paid for silence .
re@@ vo@@ red !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ days , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says that the director has no moral matter :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a re@@ wards from the State , because he didn &apos;t believe him that you are rewarded with such a way that the state has already so massi@@ vely increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a l@@ acks the mor@@ als to return to serve the state , * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead himself is controlled only by the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a used the State when it has become an in@@ exhaus@@ tible money source , and the state itself has become tired of this man , charged and finally sentenced to long prison sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hon@@ estly I don &apos;t know why this guy has been rewarded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remember the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , remember that a th@@ ief belongs to the prison : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to information from Facebook users in Myanmar , the popular social network accepted their posts from the network because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although about the origin of the word still being discussed , it is usually used to point to people ost@@ ev@@ an origin or generally used as an ad@@ jective &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cen@@ sored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or ble@@ w &quot; ( in buddh@@ ist scriptures ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of the h@@ ass@@ in Burma in Burma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements gave the word an extremely remote con@@ notation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , it is a word that mostly is used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as an evil speak against Muslims who would represent a minority of populations in Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the efforts to combat in Myanmar , the company has cen@@ sored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; is usually associated with rac@@ ism , but the word on itself does not automatically call H@@ ass@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that they also discussed the word &apos;s use or doubts , in which they have expressed the use of his use , cen@@ sored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same sequence of letters like &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example the chair of Bur@@ m@@ ese is written also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( cham@@ el@@ age ) or &apos; Cal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ ze A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of mine friends got deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he asked his friends for a spiritual kind , whether they could swe@@ eter , as he could alle@@ vi@@ ate his back pains as he did a word . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the set ku la - &quot; He@@ aling &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - re@@ sembles the ra@@ cial expression , but the context is completely different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were different reactions to the initiative of fac@@ ebook .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ ills is the opinion that she needs to reduce H@@ ass@@ in nation@@ alist nation@@ alists , but stressed that Facebook can be analytical to spread all the posts that are in sus@@ pic@@ ion driving . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it automatically filters the word .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you are writing on Fac@@ be@@ ook .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what to do instead , is to carefully analyze the post and check it out by clicking the next words . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( vanity lights ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the good thing is , that these three nation@@ alists who spread H@@ ass@@ i , received a pretty good lesson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is now time to circum@@ cise the nation@@ alism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the action provides a strong signal to all , the support language may not stop the efficiency of this strategy for long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the c@@ ens@@ orship will often start a cat@@ ch@@ - and mouse game where the user will be able to use social networks to express a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the chan@@ dise in order to express their views .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described as Facebook started to delete his posts , when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned by the social network : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; when I was aware of this new directive on Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Iron@@ ically my post was removed from Facebook and prohibited me from the li@@ ken , post and sharing of content for 24 hours , because the post &apos; s &apos; fac@@ ebook Community Standards is not dis@@ missed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook has a multitude of posts away from people who don &apos;t have any negative inten@@ tions , or who simply try to demonstrate their opinions against the ass@@ ass@@ ing radical nation@@ alists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Patrick Murphy wrote that his mail has been removed who has nothing to do with H@@ ass@@ a :
post without h@@ ass@@ essing on Facebook .
in the post the author shared his mind about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that fac@@ ebook would have to do before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community ask for advice : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook likes to have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention of reducing rac@@ ism in Burma by their platform , but it does not work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these words will only harm more hatred in the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started speaking without local context or technical support and have banned any words like &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; inheritance cur@@ ry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even as they have found out , they did not try to correct the fal@@ si@@ bly deleted posts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they would have a little more respect for the 15 million benefits , which would make them huge turnover , would be magnificent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fac@@ ebooks automatic c@@ ens@@ orship provided much ridi@@ cul@@ ed among the users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of taking it seriously , users can now make fun and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of H@@ ass@@ in to see whether their posts will be made from the network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here you can see some screen@@ shots from Facebook posts that were not ab@@ orted but nevertheless they were removed :

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair , take a pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alistic ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among other things , H@@ ass@@ i should also stimul@@ ate the violence in Myanmar in social networks , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine region , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have killed thousands of escape . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook has been designed for failure to critic@@ ise the balancing hard copies on his bur@@ ge@@ ese pages , cri@@ tici@@ zed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but instead of simply burning the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at the context as on the number of concentrated initiatives and learned from them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the little children are now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 9 June 2017 , the country &apos;s parliament unanim@@ ously approved a law which aims to prohi@@ bit this practice , so it is located at 18 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before this amendment of the marriage , some members held Hindu and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ ism Mah@@ ar@@ aj said that the state was not able to enter into the state , since that , age not the maturity of the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago a contractual partner of UN children &apos;s rights Convention is , the min@@ ors as , every man under 18 years of age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; statistics of UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who had married at 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago were 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office confirmed that between 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married in 19 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online Peti@@ tions and social media movements that endeav@@ ors to abol@@ ish laws on the children &apos;s area , followed at the foot and suc@@ cum@@ b to great support . undoubtedly they helped bring this result . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Hindu leader , for example , had no concerns to tell the critics of the children &apos;s before they should be responsible for their own business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of religious opposition provided for ten@@ sions in this actually un@@ complicated case , and sometime any doubt , if the opposition would not agree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but early in 2017 the bill of bill decided against the children &apos;s before - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( among them one woman ) of the opposition and an independent who could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , so that he would make a simple majority having him the law .
now only the president of the country must vote and aband@@ on the law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the sen@@ ators of the country gave a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle re @-@ posted on Inst@@ agram : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill of bill to be against the children &apos;s plan was in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes , and nobody decided on it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after having decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of social media users were thr@@ illed , because the laws on the children &apos;s area have finally been changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who held a minist@@ erial Conference in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has needed much time and unnecessary , but you know what ? the children &apos;s before is in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is worth every price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Abel Jackson was the opinion , it definitely lasted long enough to practice the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day has finally arrived : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
public Status update on Facebook from L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ o - Thomas says that said : the latest news !
the marriage has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for this - 0 ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society which spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was noted : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most holy age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now ir@@ respective of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the draft for the marriage was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are 41 dep@@ u@@ ties in the House of Represent@@ atives and were present in the vote 35 .
all members agreed to vote for the law .
the children are not allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago by law .
it was a long struggle ( ... ) # child@@ rens gu@@ abuse .
many thanks to all activists that have put on him .
congratulations . congratulations .
a thanks to our dep@@ u@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yet a possible cru@@ der comes in the shape of Sat Mah@@ ar@@ aj , the Secretary General of San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hindu organization of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prior to months , Mah@@ ar@@ aj has announced his intention to take the judicial system , and it seems to be approved by the law and he seems to be able to redeem his promise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the general public pro@@ secutor in Paris Al ra@@ wi , a supp@@ orter of law , it was quite lawful if Mah@@ ar@@ aj wishes to provo@@ ke the debate on the subject . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear Sat , if we , instead of holding the discussion in general , in a way that only panic and ignorance makes it possible to protect the state in our bedroom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is possible to protect the state in our bedroom ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would you then be willing to lead the discussion ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
or do you think that it is not a problem ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but whether it comes to a judicial procedure against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places on the world where the children are legally resident in different stages , even though there are laws which they are under@@ going . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

through the mirrors of websites you can watch Turkish users on Wikipedia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 18 January 2012 , the English Wikipedia page was highlighted with objec@@ tively to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IPA Cop@@ y@@ rights legislation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for over a month , Turkey closed the popular and crowd @-@ based enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pe@@ dia @-@ based enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pe@@ dia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; day for day is more clear , how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series are fighting against the lock@@ out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although many techniques used are used to use re@@ location tools for blocked web pages ( a current article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third @-@ largest VPN pre@@ valence of the world ) , most common Wikipedia users don &apos;t fall into this category . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Turkey has been locked from Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society has been held at Harvard University since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after China , Turkey is the most famous country in the world , when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the platform remains locked , several mir@@ ror@@ pages ( pages that are mir@@ ro@@ red from Wikipedia and frequently are updated ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , which supports all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its dec@@ entr@@ alized Peer @-@ to @-@ Peer network , which does not rely on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete c@@ ens@@ orship difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the content is still available despite legal ban .
in a B@@ log@@ post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after having heard the news ( about the locking from Wikipedia ) , we put everything on the IP@@ FS platform from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can help users to look at least all Wikipedia content , even if you cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IP@@ FS also insi@@ sted that this step is independently carried out from the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is solely used to screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to b@@ ypass the lock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has a mir@@ ror@@ page from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror as well as in the European Wikipedia ar@@ ist .

it is not a complete copy of a proxy address in a mirror .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can attack a different URL , which is not the original . that which one sees is from Wikipedia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essentially , the server constantly guides the request to the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia , if they are locked in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this is done by a server , which is not in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just rested at home when I had called Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) and he had a call from my father , that would be a le@@ op@@ ard at the shore of the Rap@@ ti river . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I started with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my father watched him , and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was and I immediately started to cra@@ ck pictures ! ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sag@@ ar aims to obtain a collaboration with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nepal , and would like to deep@@ en understand that wild animals are not so terri@@ fying how they look . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he ought to know it , for he rose from face to face , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a tiger cannot distur@@ b themselves from the opinion of the sheep in sleep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
bed@@ time for all animals and birds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also because of the darkness was on the way home , when suddenly the king of the he@@ avi@@ k suddenly appeared . he immediately tells us and we take me through the S@@ al trees ! ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to promote the protection of wild animals in Sag@@ ar the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
but his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and wildlife is not always easy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he waited for 22 days , and lived in a tent in order to take photos of the Bar@@ dia National Park Rec@@ ord@@ ings of up to 12 days . until he was able to photograph one tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , who live near the tourist arri@@ vals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

a revised version was published here as part of a Content @-@ sharing agreement .
in many parts of India there are women with great care to express the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
instead they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect her husband due to the social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences , they should mis@@ consider the norm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convicted of an Indian state of O@@ ne@@ a by a p@@ seu@@ do@@ al and the village community and had addressed a local relative with names . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tradition also does not name its wives by name , but is also common among males . however , they have no less assignment to fear , if at all , they should not meet this practice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the P@@ une District , nine women , among them health workers and home women , were thus quickly became the main theme of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a place just for them alone , where they discuss and discuss the enemy &apos;s enemy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as one of 56 clubs which are available in 13 Indian countries , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community of Video Volun@@ te@@ ers and eng@@ ages for the disman@@ t@@ ling of the patri@@ archy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ c has been working for seven years with the help of their vide@@ oc@@ amera , such as children &apos;s holi@@ es to the ban of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and leads them in the club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tells us how this club created a safe place for these women , and they simultaneously made it to amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ els of change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion round , did not matter by women who call their hus@@ bands on the name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she op@@ ted for this subject , because she wanted to open the conversation with an issue with which the women can easily identify with . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not to speak to their hus@@ bands by their hus@@ bands , he is also guilty to maintain all your duties and never asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini comments :
this tradition witnessed that a woman wants her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not hold this is regarded as a back@@ yard or as a woman without mor@@ ality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tradition is so deeply rooted , that we never thought about this discussion round about that matter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wanted to start out Roh@@ ini , who had never named her husband in the name , trying to try out at home as it runs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother in law .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my mother in law and my husband are still silent , after the video was over . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my husband , my husband , turned to me , saying that I should call him now by his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this self confidence in the baggage Roh@@ ini started her first discussion lu@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed that there was a good thing , because it meant that younger members of a family were protected mainly girls and women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem at U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after video projection , the women tried to put the discussion with an exercise in motion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini beg@@ ged each participant in the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , anno@@ yed , sad , loving and so on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked everyone , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they may call us what they are saying to us not respect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years , and this was the first day that she brought the name of their hus@@ bands into Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra over the cr@@ ushing of a century @-@ old tradition , in which married women never had to speak the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells us :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one woman was so shy , that during all the exercise , she k@@ icked off right in front of himself ; others decided to release all the dist@@ ressed fru@@ stration against him and his family by cursed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the expression on her faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in ad@@ renal@@ ine ren@@ zy with an ancient fire , the women decided that they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands on the name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they stopped their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in the head , she could not stop his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another club member decided to do it with supp@@ er before the whole family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when her mother in law moved to her , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a student was less understanding and the situation art@@ ete in violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini reports that women have tried to stop other practices , such as wear the car@@ cin@@ ating red dot on the forehead , which depic@@ ts the adul@@ tery : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why must only women show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would bear the zin@@ ok red point if he would also do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he laugh@@ ed only , and I heard him to carry him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the other women didn &apos;t listen to it completely , but my , they are now in a better position , not to be able to carry him on some days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many women , the discussion lu@@ cra@@ b is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we make a trip at each discussion lu@@ b .
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to worry about the women who could hear , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the last months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they d@@ anced and sang , talking about things which they had never had before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years , but I also have d@@ anced about some things , such as our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands , have never been so honest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels great to say certain things loud , no matter how small they occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is related with the clothing .
some women in the group have borne Sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for most , that &apos;s okay , but some wanted a Sal@@ em @-@ Kur@@ ta , carrying a loose shirt over a tro@@ users ; they have not dar@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a lot of quar@@ rel and discussion about the advantages of their own coat @-@ choice , mor@@ als connected with the sar@@ is and much more , ding@@ hi@@ ked Roh@@ ini into a discussion round , so women could carry them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next , they decided to take a trip to Go@@ a for whom they can carry Je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is safe to get it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the question , whether in the five months have slightly changed since their first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly coming into the roll : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far we only made small steps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some women tasted it a few times , but they listened to the name of their husband again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some , enclosed me , make it still , but only if they are alone and no other family members are there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only one or two still say the names of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women are now wearing Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women in the discussion club know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like the line of movement , or their own coat @-@ choice - at the end of a difficult to navigate river . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in giving each other self @-@ confidence there will be aware that they are seated on the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini declar@@ es :
each of us is a victim of Patri@@ archy .
I &apos;m also there .
but in any case this club gives us confidence that something will change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that there is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club , and tell other people what we speak and what we are doing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all sit in the same boat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the correspon@@ dents of the Video Volun@@ te@@ ers community come from bor@@ dered groups in India , and make videos about stories that are not reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these stories are &quot; News of those who are experiencing themselves , &quot; and offer a hyper@@ local context to report about global human rights and development requirements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a commem@@ orative day
the Beat@@ les in their landing in Japan .
screenshot of the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 29 June this year , the H@@ ash@@ tag was the ultimate in the Japanese Twitter trend , with which many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is considered an in@@ sti@@ ce in the Japanese culture of the post@@ war period .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , interview the Beat@@ les 1964 in London , noted during the 50th anniversary of the first visit : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for just under five days , the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to turn the Japanese through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people clearly become clear here , that they had no choice but the Beat@@ les received with open arms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many well @-@ known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith , when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the music of the cult club is &quot; more than just a universal language such as English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retail trade Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good morning ! ! today , the Beat@@ les commem@@ oration Day in Japan . about 51 years ago , they were in Tokyo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English teaching at Japanese secondary schools . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kit@@ ch of the Beat@@ les survived everything .
today it is Beat@@ les mem@@ oration Day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if these &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll would represent or not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as it belongs to fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ m@@ ages to the well @-@ known places that are related to the band . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 9 . if you love the Beat@@ les , you are your 5 places you need to visit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia war@@ med the population , that gl@@ atz@@ ek men could be target of attacks in Mozambique . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new system of gl@@ atz@@ ing individuals for the organ , probably for super@@ sti@@ tious acts , believed the police from Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government had a number of operations to stop the practition@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from border to Malawi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the victims was found de@@ capit@@ ated and part of the organs had been drawn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two men have been arrested and imprisoned in the consequence , that the organs of sh@@ aman in Tanzania and Malawi are being exploited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it give the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a gl@@ itter@@ ing husband &apos;s gold , or riches , declared the police officer of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time that succes@@ sive attacks on gl@@ atz@@ ek men were registered in Mozambique .
another group that is the purpose of assassination for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes is people with Al@@ bin@@ ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this resulted in that the UN in 2016 found a mission in the South African country to investigate the practice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in other countries of Africa , the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the campaigns were developed to tackle this super@@ sti@@ tion and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned the ones who intend to travel to the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who are traveling to Mozambique are destination ritual attacks in Mozambique developed the Muslim police according to the latest assassination of three gl@@ atz@@ kö@@ p@@ figen men due to their parts of body .
two susp@@ ects were detained in the district of Mil@@ ange from the assassination of the assassination .
Hus@@ um Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and residents of the city of In@@ ham@@ burg in the south of Mozambique said that the local police have already followed the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sh@@ aman involved in the death of gl@@ itter men are involved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the persecution and killing of gl@@ atz@@ kö@@ p@@ figen individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ ov@@ é@@ zia , for probably aber@@ g ritu@@ als put into dis@@ cord ( PR@@ M ) that would have existed in the head of power to have riches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days , three men with hair transplan@@ ts were murdered in this part of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of the B@@ log@@ gers poor S@@ na@@ i@@ ppa , who ad@@ ored that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty that Mozambique faces : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to ask GER@@ NE E@@ IN Mozambique , TH@@ AT I would like to go to the street in which the teachers would like to leave their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor k@@ ah@@ le or &quot; black magic &quot; would aim to get out to get their wealth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenom@@ enal , some of the opportunity for mak@@ w@@ ren humor were not going to dis@@ miss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia that was recently taken recently .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the case of imprisoned Chinese dis@@ sident Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o held attention in the international community of attention , after his lawyer was announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized due to liver canc@@ ers in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state debt ) , a manifest@@ o that calls for democratic reforms in China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the State Department of Foreign Affairs in China has referred to Li@@ u case as &quot; an internal matter , &quot; he declared it &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , China continues to receive calls from the international community to allow the Nobel Prize Lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , den@@ ser Li@@ u X@@ ia , should allow him to allow for a treatment abroad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing are different on the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised several reactions from abroad .
United Nations
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; foref@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese civil servants to discuss the fall of Li@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a person , however , refused to comment whether the United Nations should practice pressure to allow li@@ u abroad a treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Norway
Norway &apos;s Minister @-@ President Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Minister of Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Bren@@ de refused to answer questions about Li@@ u release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the relationship between China and Norway landed in Sto@@ cks , after the Nobel Peace Prize was given to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government had given us nothing to do with the decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the diplomatic relations were continued until the end of December . only in June , Norway signed an agreement with China , since the exports were mostly blocked since 2010 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the news reported that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel committee brought his hope to a un@@ conditional release , and invited Li@@ u to pick up his price in Oslo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to his arrest , he was unable to receive his price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
during ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on July 6 , the European Parliament adopted a decision in which China was requested to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately to free from house arrest and to seek medical assistance wherever he wants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , ur@@ ged China as well for the release of Li@@ us as they thought in a statement on June 30 , 2012 : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we expect at the same time that China lifts all the limitations of Mr Li@@ us wife and family members .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should meet all visits and receive them they wish , and able to be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
USA
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told him that he would wish for the treatment abroad , that he may help him in his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker of the US Embassy in China , Mary Bet@@ h Pol@@ ley , announced that the message was not allowed to release the Chinese authorities not only Li@@ u but also his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call of the US Embassy went to China an un@@ question@@ able response from China , with the exterior of the Foreign Ministry announced that &quot; no country have the right to inter@@ f@@ ere and ir@@ responsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pol@@ ley told us that China should offer the following couple :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protection and freedom , such as travel equality and access to the medical care of its choice , to them according to Chinese Constitution and legal system and international obligations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , J@@ eff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision to Congress the Chinese government to push out Li@@ u and his wife . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Germany or Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German government spokesperson Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin I hope that Li@@ u &quot; needs the medical support that he needs &quot; and that &quot; a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o &quot; should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chinese president X@@ i Jin@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg , Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing of the news agency Reuters , that China had big concerns if the Bub@@ bel could over@@ shadow the visit in Hamburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John McCain on behalf of Li@@ u to provide an appropriate medical care and to give him the opportunity to escape from his family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ us Adv@@ oc@@ ate told us that Li@@ u Woman , Li@@ u X@@ ia , was able to visit him every day , but the police are not allowed to contact somebody outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
McC@@ all deals on :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada calls for China to safegu@@ ard his international human rights , including free speech , and free to remain closed for the exercise of these rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
France
France &apos;s foreign ministry demanded China in a declaration on 29 June to allow cer@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments which he needs , regardless of where his wife and family may have contact with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the news channel France Info noted that the French government had welcome Li@@ u in the country , there was no further information that France would eventually receive him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on June 27 , China sur@@ passed the Council of the City Council in Taiwan and providing a greater tolerance to those who call peaceful means to challenge political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the Tai@@ wan@@ ese schol@@ ar Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu also called on China to allow people to treat intellec@@ tu@@ ally intellectual li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dalai Lama
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed herself very worried about Li@@ u on June 28th in order to pray for Li@@ u &apos;s well @-@ being . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he spoke about Li@@ u :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is my belief that he took , and for whom he had been ru@@ ined , would have led to a harmonious , stable , and weal@@ thy China , which again would have contributed to a peaceful world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt personally very moving and encouraged also when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tu@@ als and affected people inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised as an independent state in Singapore .
but according to the Justice Minister K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam was to be considered a city in Singapore .
this re@@ mark has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the meeting of the international branch of the international branch of the State of New York , the Minister of domin@@ ating the only political party of Singapore was understood because they compared Singapore with other countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he assi@@ sts that Singapore was to be considered a city .
... nobody asked whether New York be a democracy ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is , most people avoid a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog of Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the justice minister of justice to defend the existing authori@@ zation of power in Singapore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then , according to all our efforts and offerings to create this valuable country , you can say that we ultimately would not be a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a must . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Singapore , if you are not my land , whose land is it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reasons were not very no@@ bel , he defended an idea , according to which one can &apos;t measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of which he appeared inev@@ it@@ ably un@@ democratic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , both cities that are permanently led by a party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you reach the main point of the subject , the good old ly@@ re from the author@@ itarian regim@@ es will leave , leaving the distor@@ ted logic , because it fits better to their power . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end of the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mut@@ am@@ al@@ gam was giving answers to his American guests regarding our press , our Judi@@ ative , our political system really no answers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he def@@ ending relevant questions with non @-@ answers rational art .
Rachel Z@@ eng is calling for Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ te in his opinion that she did not understand this conclusion .
personally I think it &apos;s a bit difficult to swallow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Singapore is not a country , but one city is to which country belongs to our city ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in short I don &apos;t get anything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be very thank@@ ful if our cheaper K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ te would take the effort to clari@@ fy this point , if he has paid high , in order to be part of the government of Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by having published his comment on the blog , he points out regarding the critics to read the whole tran@@ scription of the conference to better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ am@@ al@@ gam , according to which Singapore was one city and not a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
read the inscription .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a city , &quot; declared why the elections in Singapore were so un@@ easy , even if we are looking forward to free and righteous choices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in cities , he negoti@@ ated Singapore with cities in the U.S. ( and how many of these cities see a party for decades ? ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; was not a country , &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ grac@@ am@@ al@@ gam as leader of a her@@ ent @-@ growing generation that makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I &apos;m talking about what the Justice Minister &apos;s Justice of Singapore was going to very close ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old she@@ ath which I expected - be with them , or not , that &apos;s another matter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ am@@ al@@ gam , Member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure that he really believes he is aware of what he defended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the T@@ EM@@ AS@@ EK Review dis@@ covers the vulner@@ abilities of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams arguments :
did Mr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ sty &quot; du@@ sty a mistake &quot; or was it a joy@@ ous speaker ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Singapore is not a country , we will only be regarded as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if not , on which country go back the sovereign rights of the city Singapur ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Singapore is unique and it is both alike and city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since he plays an important role within the governmental cabin , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mut@@ gam is of grave importance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do the people of Singapur do their military service , defend it only their city but not their land ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who must pay back our prime minister ?
what is the value of our pink human ID ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ten@@ ds the Journey of a Dec@@ ade to the affir@@ mation of Singapore , and was always a city : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this sentence seems to have become many of the people of Singapur ...
no one ever told that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear testimony how &quot; the defense of the country above all &quot; etc . , but this is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .

global Vo@@ ices wonder@@ ed his editors : what is the most mis@@ leading aspect of your homeland or homeland ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , with rum@@ ours about certain parts of the world and a different fac@@ et will be shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest part of this series is created by Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question that will be put to me in Japan is : &quot; are you an American ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry . &quot; I &apos;m coming from Canada . &quot; I live in Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I live in Japan and again in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on what the situation is taking place , it is considered polite to show interest in his conversation by asking personal questions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question then follows : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans cook internally in anger , when they are held for Americans , but I don &apos;t b@@ other me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for someone who does not know , there is little that the Canadian is different from Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans create a Canadian flag well visible on their backpack , if they travel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
everyone love Kan@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans however ... .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I started to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and the 11th of September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always borne small map@@ le leaves in their luggage to distinguish themselves from their US neighbours .
we have a free health care !
there is no weapons with us !
gay couples have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think that Canada is so great .
we are courteous .
we obviously say very often &quot; sorry . &quot;
Canada is believed to be considered the toler@@ ant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
first I have many American friends that I admire very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there would be nothing for me , if you would like to switch me to Johnny from Dallas for example . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael on Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first : as a &quot; nice &quot; called &quot; is basically to be sk@@ in@@ able - as the ben@@ evol@@ ent , gentle , but trag@@ ically in@@ significant N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has one own Canadian Double @-@ gän@@ ger ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the actual problem exists that &quot; cute &quot; has no personality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are no corners and edges ; nothing at which you can drive .
harmless to be harmless and in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous and to earn no attention .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that can be something good if you feel un@@ noticed in the background , far from the things that happen around one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would go even so far to say that the desire to be free and alone , a chief of the Canadian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we tend to take care of our own business only .
what out@@ si@@ ders are called &quot; nice &quot; might be simply just cool pol@@ it@@ eness .
Can@@ adi@@ ans are not talking about the fence across the neigh@@ bors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are missing the warm hear@@ ty , open friendliness , who by now connect with my American friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck@@ ily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , Jus@@ tin Tru@@ de@@ au entered the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ er is more than just &quot; nice &quot; . our prime minister has made Canada just sexy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
music video of a Pop band in Thailand in Thailand
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one in Thailand &apos;s famous Pop band has released a music video which took hold of power in 2014 , despite its promises to re@@ produce the civilian government , still gover@@ ns the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band tat@@ too describes a young man who tells him that rules him his girlfriend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although not expressly politically , the music video is in@@ directly related to the per@@ military rule of the Jun@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the band has been praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage , to describe the situation of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the video for the song was a huge success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only within the first three days , the video loaded on Facebook was divided 1.@@ 254 times and received 8.@@ 800 lights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand by watching a group of activists to watch this video . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the video may interpre@@ t as a creative and entertaining introduction into Thai politics , as it deals with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take a look at these images of videos which relate to some of the political issues , which Thailand followed in the past three years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; possibly refer to the dra@@ us@@ ability section 44 of the preliminary condition , which commander to the commander of the host absolute decision making important national subjects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th general rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious range of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons that were considered to be critics in the Jun@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law concerning computer@@ crimin@@ ality , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear rules often are used to exp@@ ose activists and other critics of the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this purpose , a new unity in the army was also established , monitoring online content and individuals who def@@ aults and pursued the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thailand is a strict law against &quot; harvest Maj@@ este &quot; ( maj@@ es@@ ins@@ ult ) .
on 20 May 2014 the war was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later there came to a coup in the army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the problems , which the Jun@@ ta continued to buy , is their decision to buy sub@@ mar@@ ines , even though security experts agreed that the purchase was unnecessary and a waste of tax collectors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the video , even how people will be thrown into a black delivery van , before they bring them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are in prison , because they allegedly killed &quot; confusion &quot; in society and threat@@ ens Internet users for long term liability , they should ins@@ ult the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile the te@@ aser of the songs from the band , which im@@ it@@ ated the Sal@@ ut &quot; Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em &quot; im@@ it@@ ated , was already used by Putin &apos;s opponents during the protests in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the post @-@ war society slowly re@@ covers slowly in East Asia @-@ Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ hor@@ astic war , but his s@@ cars are still visible in this part of the Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern districts in T@@ ku@@ ar@@ al show significant pictures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ bours are located in the hydro@@ electric bas@@ ins of Ab@@ ch@@ asia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , depreci@@ ations , Geor@@ g@@ iers and Armen@@ ians still lived and processed into Soviet times in the area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today the largest part of the Russians and Ab@@ dom@@ es live in the area .
such sett@@ lements are also called gh@@ ost cities in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people still lived there , today only a few hundred people are in these gh@@ ost towns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2011 , the total population of the total population of 16@@ ,000 people , after having barely increased over a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 1989 about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; everything is a result of the war &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60s , the ch@@ ry@@ ch@@ et@@ ch@@ kov@@ kas are symbo@@ lically for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the buildings are disin@@ teg@@ rated and very rare , they are inhabited by more than two families . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

at the entrance to the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a conversation , and it is easy to end this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; everything is a result of the war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why speak ?
it is unique any@@ how . &quot;
before war the village was full of life .
there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens who served all of the community .
now there are only paved road with banned spl@@ end@@ or buildings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who once lived in this place and did their contribution to the central planning industry of the Soviet Union , have left the borough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha live about fifty inhabitants .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a and in the other villages it looks similar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ v , one or two families , can be seen in the balconies where washing is dried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of an destroyed house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when she discovered me with the camera in the hand , they immediately withdraw back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; our Mother is forbidden to let us take pictures &quot; says one of the girls .
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is simply forbidden to us all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the girl whis@@ pers up her friend , and suddenly they left the destroyed building and dis@@ appearance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many people in the area work for a small Turkish bath company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ u@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the subsi@@ st@@ ant economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal requirements ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable growing .
it &apos;s difficult to get over the laps .
the district management offers free candles and bread for the villages in winter .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen ; but we will build the cour@@ gett@@ es &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about ten years ago , an older woman was named Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante v@@ ein , as it is called in the neighbourhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite her oldest daughter living in France , Gal@@ ina has not left before Ab@@ ch@@ asia to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asia . &quot; she tells us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina wants to accept no financial support from her daughter and insi@@ sted that she supports her young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly r@@ ents are just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden or house , it &apos;s very hard to survive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
aun@@ t G@@ luck tells us that she and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
when there are holidays we visit .
but we cannot do this continuously - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
while she tells her story she appears a recent neighbor in the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ asha &quot; calls her to her . &quot; they told us we could build zu@@ cchini .
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ gett@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to anything &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha , together with her husband and the five common children lived in her house for some time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day it reminds in front of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite its relatives who live in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ ch@@ asia just gone ) , they did not leave the opportunity to leave . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; recently we bought the land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but this will take another thing , &quot; she explains it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives approximately $ 9 for every child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; near the house where Nat@@ ascha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once found , they hold pigs , cows , t@@ aps and chick@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells her first a very fri@@ ghtening situation , as many people left the village after the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but over time it lost her fear@@ fulness .

&quot; we don &apos;t have fear of dark street or few people .
you can get used to anything .
many people believe that this building was destroyed during the war .
but in fact it has rather something to do with lo@@ ot@@ ings .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right .
I remember the city once and the war once were . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when our conversation draws to an end , a little boy is running over us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it runs through the windows of an destroyed building and hiding .
a ball flies from the window and another boy hun@@ ts him .
he plays with the ball that roll down the hill .
a group of children now pursue the ball .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they run , some of them throw stones for the ru@@ ined buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these ruins are a part of their childhood that care for clou@@ d@@ iness in their lives .
you don &apos;t know it different .

in Mexico the &quot; Mama Africa &quot; migrants during their long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez runs a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula in the State of Chi@@ ap@@ as at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this article by Amy Bra@@ cken was published on 19 April 2017 at the website of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org , and published here with kind permission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the way of migrants attemp@@ ting to cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is located on the border to Guatemala . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s a very simple hotel close to the city center .
it will be led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican guy . a little woman with a cor@@ di@@ ous pink spectacle and gold @-@ colored earrings in t@@ ed@@ dy bear form .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was born in Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez , and grew up in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this nick@@ name says the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a target for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tian , who are on the transit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for about 2,50 Dollar per night , guests sleep in simple rooms , with ca@@ j@@ acks , slopes and beds made of metal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - but hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells the people in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast to call them : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently it is more quiet , but in this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are only 24 rooms that slept already outside on boxes .
she wants to refuse anyone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she also helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are sick , she bu@@ ys them medications that they cannot pay them , they massage them with a bal@@ m that exhau@@ sting them from the long journey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived at a short time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa is a suitable nick@@ name for Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a yo@@ gh@@ test sta@@ che ) posing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the family came from Angola to Brazil , hoping to go to Boston . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo : Amy Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel that African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to reach Boston where she is hoping to find her husband and the three children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have already lived in Brazil , however , it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to take a first stop in South America and then draw towards north . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard of other signs from Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the route , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells us that the Hai@@ tian and the Afri@@ cans were often travelling together , and that Afri@@ cans were already talking to W@@ hat@@ s@@ App from Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like many of his companion , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a builder on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the soccer world championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he started his trip to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since months he has been a guest at Mama Africa : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money , to purchase the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I wonder if he is in contact with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; he answers . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her that her guests are often sending word messages when they continue to greet them , or to report about the course of their journey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their work .
she does not know much about Africa but their guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez probably is very famous here , but it is not the only spar@@ ks hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ est@@ ula . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
it was this winter in Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family migrants in her small house .
he is polic@@ eman and has found that bus tickets to be sold to many African immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he began to help them to get a reasonable price , and he offered them his house for a dollar the night offered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the moment 25 people there are mainly Hai@@ tians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some sleep on blan@@ kets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests do through .
&quot; I &apos;ve lived in the United States . &quot; he tells us . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing .
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled after a raid on his work place from the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ est@@ ula , comes from Central America , other inhabitants open the doors of their homes for them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled the Honduras of his wife and three children from people who would have been trying to comp@@ resses money from him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for accommodation and offered a unknown thing , a single one , has offered it its roof . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few months later , the family lives and tried to decide where the next step is to go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the courses you can find the passengers quiet their phone .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests to a large part of Somalia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems to be happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who went away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like a proud grand@@ mother they slide it in their album with numerous photos .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are one of her daughter , with African hair dryers which you have a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she laugh@@ ed mour@@ ning for her briefly .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on &quot; is repeated every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install an monitoring app on their mobile phones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a check @-@ Point for personal communication devices , in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter users , or ever @-@ star@@ ved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , ethnic min@@ orities in western China are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 10 July , the mobile user received the Tian@@ sh@@ an District of the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi a cell notification in which it shows the district government called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the press release , the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to allow access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but moreover k@@ ò@@ n@@ ingly used the authorities to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture , because they had installed the app , posted messages with a private we@@ chat group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the press release that the app would obtain the sources and the distribution channels of terr@@ orists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang@@ s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective performance with system categories for children and adults introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elecom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphy , from online sc@@ am , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to make users attention to how much time they spend online and remot@@ ely control your own home network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this app with fil@@ tering for min@@ ors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an app with these functions can be used in many ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; state actors or even h@@ acker capable of manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or steal it from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while reports on digital c@@ ens@@ orship in China are mostly concentrated on the experiences of users in larger towns in the East and south , reality is very often dim for those who live in distant lands , like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict zones , the authorities often arrange extreme Zen@@ ob@@ ics and surveillance measures and sometimes rout@@ in@@ ely Internet shut@@ downs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published on Twitter @-@ based media Out@@ let &quot; Images from the City of China , &quot; published photos from a Check@@ point to check the residents on the police , whether they have installed the monitoring app . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile mess@@ y asked the people to install the app within 10 days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are detected in a Check@@ point with a device without these software , they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you forced the people to use appliances , which are intended for older people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a form of bond@@ age through education technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description has also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description from which the software can lift up a Windows operating system and thus gets unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard disk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computer and mobile phones are made in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , the regulations of the city of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang are possibly to minimize the distribution of illegal contents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all government branches , authorities and related institutions , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security office when using their computer and communication devices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a current report by Freedom House , an American Human Rights Organisation and also mentioned these new monitoring methods :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang the authorities published in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a regulation on all inhabitants and entrepren@@ eurs , up to 1 August their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , remote disks , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the intention is to identify and destroy any terrorist videos . however , this action commen@@ ds the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sleep or death - Part 1 : all cri@@ es to death

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the row &apos;s sleep or death , where the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane is described in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far away from our blue , virtual world you see and show that you are totally alone in a place where everything is important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has gradually dissolved and a truth revealed , which is clearly identi@@ fi@@ able , both inside and out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one that makes your name all honor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one that has kno@@ cked into a list of feelings and phra@@ ses , leaving no met@@ aph@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when the reality come back and you go behind the scenes , the characters will turn into beings from flesh and blood , and they cri@@ es out to death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all doubts arise in smoke , and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth is caught up between the walls that your parents , and before them have built your grand@@ parents , stone and stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have arrested me and my Father three times , but that was not enough to help me . &quot; as the boss of security , it would be formulated - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he presented his power over us , showing even the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts that we knew . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; five young people were torn out during a peaceful protests like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it ranged from , so that the city bit@@ es the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scre@@ ams . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all of the districts sought not only my own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , it was still cal@@ am@@ less , for the wrong time , even if I set no high demands on a city that has penet@@ rated to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their compli@@ ces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the third night things had a bit cal@@ med , after the power supply in the neighborhood had to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I broke the silence , by using several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice gri@@ pped through the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to get together .
I was not alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many friends , real friends joined me ; we al@@ lied to a glorious picture that was filled up my expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in such a moment , you will be aware that you get the Spirit from the light , but it is simply not interested in the barley . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; make you ready , we meet us at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow down - nothing can give you back to your voice , after you have set off from the body till the office of the Security Service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I arrived there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Colonel Gh@@ assan stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now also . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Colonel Gh@@ assan begins to speak , &quot; Let me listen to me as you are called &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; or you &apos;re only brave enough to sh@@ out if we are not nearby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his glorious eyes pointed to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you are real to see me in my eyes , not to the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did so has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old and it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
maybe it was in my fol@@ ly and vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure , when I answered : &quot; I wouldn &apos;t thought that you &apos;ve forgotten my voice again since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I have never stopped to see you in my eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I have no word of what I said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he finds him in individual and his father like that . &quot;
&quot; his father like the same with that . &quot;
the con@@ tention of this cursed proposition lies before me in the nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a torture which I was exposed for months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I scre@@ ams the farm .
in the first office I let everything go back with me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; afterwards , through the farm and into the second office , leading through a course toward individual cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I realize all details exactly one before I was super@@ vis@@ ing the room .
otherwise it was otherwise allocated to me a larger cell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share it with only one another prisoner , and can set me immediately , without having to wait for their permission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I gra@@ b@@ bed back on a proven communication method : to beat against the wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I learned that my cell @-@ gen@@ os@@ se was a &quot; er@@ sth@@ ling . &quot;
after a long co@@ hes@@ itation he answered me ultimately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apparently in no one of the surrounding cells , one of the most prestigious man @-@ old age , who looks like me and is called &quot; the Doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in perfect darkness , no striking faces can recognize me , and doctors do not exist here ; we are all only numbers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; maybe someone who sounds like my voice ? &quot;
all the answers link its existence .
perhaps it was moved into one of the big cells .
perhaps he will stop immediately .
the heir finder had covered me ; they would fre@@ t him if I tar@@ ry .
li@@ ar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to have a bir@@ d@@ ful to drive all these cranes , which lab@@ s themselves at the fruits in the garden of my head lab@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can still hear her &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from the distance .
it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always around this time the shadow sho@@ ots over every day .
the door opens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was always convinced that black that is the color of destruction , until I saw the yellow light that gave us the gray one : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; Games on 13th S@@ ure of Kor@@ an ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they are here to be heard . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the secret to protect the state security before us and to prevent the terr@@ orists in us , they talk in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ ec@@ tic dial@@ ect - so they played their sec@@ t@@ arian nar@@ ration card and betra@@ yed the close eye view of their world view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is no house where there is no land , it is a curse to call it a co@@ existence to transform the crime of their c@@ lans into a hero . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I medi@@ tate in the hearing and meet Abu I@@ mad , a slim and sto@@ cky man ; at least he will come in mind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions used to prevent him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can protest this day and protest to demonstrations , which will soon be an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I have grown acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to me not to answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can really say no more precisely , when ins@@ ults and pun@@ ches become a friendly meeting for me to an ordinary communication agent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when and how it happened was un@@ important .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any voice in me said that I had to get used to myself , that I had to be punished if I had nothing to earn this punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on penalty in all its variety .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his command is to rip me as much flesh as possible from the body , as much as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he calls the loving &quot; con@@ fes@@ sion . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the l@@ aken .
your head@@ land rejo@@ ices in your cry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him , and you cannot hold your rebu@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my sh@@ re@@ y did not be@@ have him enough , why they cast the tube out through a cord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during my first arrest , I asked whether the investig@@ ator had been working as a garbage collector , or if it belonged to the normal working equipment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they had four cables in each other to present us to present great invention of a huge cable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within a single hour , three of them changed , while I was still on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had lost all my body feeling - and my voice , which is why I heard my voice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head@@ sman noticed the cooling and didn &apos;t find any fav@@ ours , which is why he took the next to an electrically charged staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current flow@@ ed my whole body enough to store my whole neighborhood .
my half @-@ naked body that lay stretched on the ground was the perfect power conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after two terrible hours , he decided that he had fulfilled his duty to this night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must have been around midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I decided to sleep again , and let &apos;s say , that was my only option . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some hours left that I came in for a few minutes .
then the call for the morning prayer .
the door opens and the morning light meets the space &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhaus@@ tive young man : &quot; my Lord , my father has to worry about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be silent and go away ; you will be laid . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always been released .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b se@@ duc@@ es most of his time inside ; sometimes he def@@ aults to his canvas , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what one can rely on , is a cigarette between his fingers or his own nic@@ otine on the lips to discover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he lives in the upper floor of his family house , which belonged to them since 1967 ; the year , when Israel was forced to escape from their village in Palestine , in which they had lived in Palestine as fel@@ ah@@ y@@ een ( about : farmers ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist , addressed to the conservative majority and ques@@ tioned about gender roles , sexu@@ ality and free expression through art and rape . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his music that often deals with themes like ori@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian poultry , but also in cities not only in his hometown Am@@ man Rel@@ ev@@ ance , but also in cities , from Damascus to San@@ aa in Yemen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by limits in his thinking , having suffered under the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if he doesn &apos;t open it openly , he turns against the US @-@ American foreign policy a special negoti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considered his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b believes that his compassion for those who are trying to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian Refu@@ gee of the second generation , &quot; even if he was born in Jordan , and has never been in Palestine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own life circumstances so &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I pour two cups in water dissolved in water . it is the Holy month Ram@@ ad@@ an . during this time it is intended for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also says that the public consumption of food is illegal during the Ram@@ ad@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness of breaking with ancient traditions . on the other hand there is a cup of coffee at a sen@@ sing hot Jun@@ it@@ ag to do little with protest against Islam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically , the sli@@ my warm coffee and the sw@@ ings of the K@@ ent cigarette into the nose primarily speak of freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially if one throws a look into the neighbouring countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it avo@@ ids to avoid basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ ad@@ an water - to land not in prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently the Interior Ministry of Interior has cancelled a show of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a . already for the second time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some parliamentary MPs , that support Islamic acc@@ la@@ tives , the Muslim Brotherhood , the Muslim Brotherhood , Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country , and the main reason for the concert halls be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with CN@@ N , the Euro MP and former press spokesperson for the Islamic Coalition , D@@ IMA Tah@@ ri@@ b said , &quot; was cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people also claim the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and free expression in the Arab world , which represents the old proven legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regim@@ ents in the entire region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a summar@@ ized the people of human rights as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; who continue to use for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this statement should probably not be easy @-@ to @-@ end rh@@ et@@ oric , but actually reflects the cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which occurs in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b returned to body of traditional gender car@@ men that formed his vision of the fate of Arabic women who have sex . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a apparently carried out unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch down to the corners of the canvas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of the countless women who lost their lives through the hands of those who should have confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Jordan , the number of &apos; Hon@@ estly &apos; has increased in Jordan , the un@@ official outside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of hon@@ ours in 2016 reached its peak ; however , Jordan becomes an institutional infrastructure to support women who tried or domestic violence or domestic violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a law on breaking out in 1954 , women who are exposed to a family @-@ famili@@ al force , &quot; in in@@ definite period of time , and for their release is often necessary for many years of bureaucra@@ tic expenditure as well as a guarantee that the woman will not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is well known for leaving behind subjects , which have long been t@@ abo@@ o in his country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b denied that his work is politically , however , that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explic@@ it attacks on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , not separated from politics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
I was fool@@ ed into politics . &quot; he said .
in a song named &quot; Edward Sa &apos;s &quot; in a song H@@ da@@ i@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity .
the focus is on poverty in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list of songs , which are politically political , can be carried on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano &quot; .
in this song a verse repe@@ ats itself often :
&quot; you are free and everyone else is . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market in which one can get in his words , &quot; it can be what you want &quot; - be faith or un@@ belief , H@@ et@@ ero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he noticed that hardly anybody in Jordan about the rights of homosexu@@ als and les@@ bians said , and that comments on the equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were strongly cen@@ sored by 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2014 H@@ da@@ i@@ b introduced an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online programme Ro@@ ya to mark later that his comments were torn from the context and in his opinion were cen@@ sored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts , but was only a mach@@ ined version , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b adverti@@ ses the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that int@@ oler@@ ance against homosexu@@ als not exp@@ ire Islam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ vo , a po@@ ets of the eighth century who still remained in memory thanks to its homo@@ erotic poetry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ vo should work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , in the eighth century could write openly about homosexu@@ ality , why can Jordan did that not ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , did nothing with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled to do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ic kingdom , nothing is new anymore , that the government attacks against freedom of expression and that progressive voices are put to silence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian newspaper Intelligence joined several former government officials and members of the teachers &apos; counsel concerning the problems addressed in the land rooted in their land rooted corruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this , the concert H@@ da@@ i@@ bs knows only the tip of the ice@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about structural changes in the next generation of the Jord@@ an@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for him , progress is a constant giving and take . Jordan has prevented a stand for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - so it looks for the second time to take place in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , H@@ da@@ i@@ b dreamed as millions of other Arabs also , out of an Arab world without intervention from abroad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he not only dreams of it , his work up to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the region will be with the help of music , art and literature of a true and fundamental op@@ enness - and not by bombs , pursu@@ it uni@@ tions and artificial nature . at least he hopes that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
until it is where H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue and thus resist resistance .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
these huge ex@@ travag@@ ant war@@ d@@ olls are as fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one susp@@ ects that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many regions of To@@ ho@@ us . a further theory bears , in which armies mar@@ ched from the west Japan to force the indigenous people of the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to snap some great seats , so we have a great view .
you can only imagine how large these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital city of Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en ( organized a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ) .
I &apos;ve been watching the meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fixed cars are just visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori that hosts the only True and this amazing way to spend its summer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rarely , outer appearance and body care as important as in this story , as they help to keep Peruvian youth from crime and promote a legitimate profession like the hair@@ dresser . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , is located at the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic centre of Lima , where the rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drugs trade are all daily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in April 2017 , a survey published that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region did not feel safe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time Peru - like many other medium and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trend , the appearance and therefore also the fallen hair@@ styles by famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Brazil ) , has resulted in more normal people in the experienced hands of hair@@ dos , which can re@@ train these elabor@@ ate hair@@ styles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the unique demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme borders of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event that has been taking place since 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in there , experts join in each other to show who can create the most outstanding L@@ ooks that can be seen in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational institutions like the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who found itself in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to maintain their weapons against hair@@ styling and allows them to find their weapons in hair@@ styling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; motivated by these activities and the resulting possibilities , dozens of young people saw that they can sei@@ ze a profession which is currently in fashion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; starting in March , school year offered special education workshops and reported on some of their achievements : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 1995 , we were the only school in the municipality and the district , which we are very proud of , because of love for children we have built this educational community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Colombia : love Let@@ ters to gu@@ err@@ illa

using with kind permission .
the following article is the modified version of the &quot; lov@@ em@@ aking &quot; lov@@ em@@ ulation to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters who published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the report will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write letters of love to people who we know ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; isn &apos;t it much more important to people who have to be em@@ itted , aff@@ ection to aff@@ ection ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this question was exactly what the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ á@@ r@@ ra@@ ga of the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os were inspired by the Young Youth Foundation and inspired her to write gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to write gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
only recently was their land of an historical event and they wanted to contribute to this part : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the Guer@@ il@@ la@@ tionary F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Armed Forces in Colombia ) .
International was for the signing of the peace agreement as so significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel Santos received a Nobel Peace Prize for his contributions to the Nobel Peace Prize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , before the Colombia is a long way until one can speak of true reconciliation and peace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ err@@ illa fighters who lived in illegal camps for many years and carried out their arms around the clock , now they have to integrate into life as civilians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Colom@@ bian society in turn , which was acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases opposed to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , must support them in their ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young colum@@ bi@@ kers had to come together and assist with the integration process .
and just this they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to the former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them back in society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the goal of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , who will then be handed over personally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the Recon@@ ciliation was initiated at the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Prize committee which took place in February 2017 in Bog@@ ot@@ á . there they had been a chance to speak to the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this explained that we write the people who love to write thousands of love letters in Valentine &apos;s Day , but those who need them much needed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he plan , he told him to share his love with people who needed the most urgent commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the plan was created to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of F@@ ARC to show their place in society and to make their dis@@ course from a war story to a common history of peace , &quot; they say . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to now more than 2000 letters were collected during the campaign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ I never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first 500 letters were handed over to the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , on March 19th . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a group of 40 students from the University Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo of the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art traveled into the camp to personally super@@ v@@ ise the letters personally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the members of the F@@ ARC , as they did before , to receive the commands of their leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this time , they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings could go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z Av@@ ila later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sandra Par@@ ra , a staff member of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after we passed the letters , a former war@@ rior led me to the Guer@@ illa fighters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters live ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighters who wrote something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid to go into , because next to him on the bed a M@@ GL @-@ Gran@@ at@@ cher lay , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answered him , and said , &quot; Hi , what are they going to do ? &quot; he answered , &quot; I am answering a letter that someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; never in my life someone has written something like this , and I answer it : and suddenly the tears flow@@ ed over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ gged him completely and put me up beside the Gren@@ ade La@@ un@@ cher .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps he was sorry for the war , it was fortun@@ ate to be all the years of faithful compan@@ ions of this fighter and would help him write this letter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man told me more about his life . he never had expected anything from life than war . to preserve the F@@ ARC , it was never thought that someone would never forgive me for my sins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but now I know that there is a society that is waiting for us with open arms .
until now I have learned how to deal with weapons .
but now where peace is prev@@ ailing that I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
to the start students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC arrived in a discussion round .
the students were all raised as being war and the F@@ ARC already existed in secret .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is why the leaders of F@@ ARC explained the history of organizing their ide@@ als and insights into their views over the peace process : &quot; for many years , we can help us to develop the society in this country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for one purpose of this mag@@ nit@@ ude , it is worth to overcome all obstacles &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to hear these people who had never seen so far and had no choice to know that people who often have seen as monsters and even hate their environment , was very painful for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reality where the country lives , doesn &apos;t hurt me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it comforts me that all people - even those who have killed and done so much harm , can contribute to us and give a smile and a hug . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many former fighters have responded to letters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the town of Cal@@ i , following letter : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the colum@@ bi@@ an@@ ists have been prophes@@ ied that after dis@@ arm@@ ament peace would prevail .
but this is not the case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as it gives ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will be always people who are prepared to stand up and protest to their rights . and that is fully justified ( ... ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the F@@ ARC we are now fighting for peace to a policy of weapons without arms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , we call all the def@@ en@@ ders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ide@@ ology they belong to rise over all those who dream of a country in war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we give you our word , contribute to our contribution and make sacrif@@ ices , for we know our own experience that is nothing simple . those under us who defend the life as the basis of existence , many difficulties will be im@@ min@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our way , there will be many obstacles , but we will overcome them together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it follows the translation of an article that was written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ macro@@ sum@@ owa , and was first published in the OC Media website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hom@@ osex@@ ual and bro@@ ader people live in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region , including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and ex@@ tor@@ tion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with fear we have witnessed the coverage of the last months over the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the threat , which is an Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ ian above the LGB@@ T@@ Q community , has not only been created overnight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who has dealt with us some of their experience and talked with us what is currently happening in the republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has been taken over several months ago , after reports were published that relate the deportation , torture and killing of qu@@ e@@ er@@ ors in the Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aiah Inn , who captured a light on the methods of Che@@ chen @-@ Ch@@ echn@@ ical authorities and put them into secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sabrina has born a woman in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
ever since childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , and she went to Moscow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a group had experienced by the sexual relief of their land@@ lady the hunt for Sabrina has been opened .
her life went out of fear of her life in the USA .
Sabrina : I worked as a volunteer group in a human rights organisation .
one day it was told me that someone needed my help .
it acted out a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who had been in trouble .
she had no money so I took her without hes@@ itation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but while I tried to help her , someone made a copy of my documents and spread it all over the Internet with my phone number and a picture of me . &quot; then there is no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , who can eliminate these shame ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after that the pictures of my documents were made by the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I was just doing some shopping from the back seat of my car , I heard a men &apos;s voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I hurt nothing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard another sentence , but this time on t@@ sch@@ ematic : &quot; how long will you honor the family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that there was a young man who was not 30 years old .
then I lost the consciousness and the last du@@ cks in the hospital again .
apparently some women had to get everything and started sh@@ out .
the man had fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two samples on my right lung wing .
OC Media : in which patient boxes were you put - in men or women ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sabrina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name . but the doctor understood and put me to the women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for that I am very grateful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I read his name for the first time in his office , I got to fear the fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he turned out to be a good man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am grateful to him , that he is resp@@ ect@@ ful with me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
I got threats in last February .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they called me , and wrote me - Rel@@ ated , stranger , some completely unknown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited from neighbours and some distant relative .
the requested to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that it was all a lie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they put absurd demands : some said to me , I ought to prove that I had not changed on the streets of Gros@@ ny , saying that I had not changed my generation that everything was just bad speech and Photoshop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have grain size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family want to handle with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some elderly people say once my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; You brought a monster to the world that has not only your family , but the entire republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a dev@@ out woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my mother became too much , and she lay down a kn@@ ck around his neck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
luck@@ ily the neigh@@ bors came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the flat several times a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window there was a car with dar@@ ken windows and a number plate with a 95 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after it happened the third time , it was clear to me that something lazy was lazy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my human rights of human rights convinced the number plates - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you find ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for safety reasons , I don &apos;t want to give up their name , but I want to remember them all : they really helped me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with her help I left the country , but then something unexpected happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I still cannot compreh@@ end how it could be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly before visiting Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I bought it without giving me up without notice .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tra@@ sh .
arrived and checked in the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you &apos;d not think about security , just because you have left the country ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can already know our people in which place du . you even know your room number .
just to prove it : it &apos;s the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , we don &apos;t talk about the sex relief , that &apos;s a table topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
so much I also wish to overcome this se@@ el@@ ic barrier I can &apos;t overcome .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always say that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we chat with a camera , I am truly trying to watch how the person wants to look at them from their past - so on my male form . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what are your friends and those who have stayed ?
Sabrina : I filed a report in Washington last week .
for the I needed recent information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone that has fed one and a half months in my gun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told that while the Ram@@ ad@@ an was not arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an could barely wait and he didn &apos;t lock up a new wave . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most likely they will focus on family and relatives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this I mean , they probably invite the relatives to deal with the person affected by the person and at the end a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : are even more gay men in this secret detention now ?
Sabrina : a friend of mine says it wasn &apos;t very many .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to place the Kad@@ y@@ rows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as I know you will be held there where you can present them later as terr@@ orists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say : should they be moved , they will show their bodies in television and claim that they had attacked any village or a military base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if these people were not just van@@ ished , but di@@ pped accurately to radi@@ cal@@ ise himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : is that just a assum@@ ption , or have you a source of such information ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sabrina : I just quote somebody who was imprisoned for a one and a half months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says that many people have gone in this prison , after her be@@ ard had grown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there has been nothing new from them since then .
they took them away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself , when these people were taken away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , they were not presented as ban@@ dits until now there were no reports . we assume , however , that such actions are quite possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why wouldn &apos;t you have allowed to shave these people ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; know if these per@@ secu@@ tions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people , who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , have already been buried in the past ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sabrina : I always wore my hair long .
I had a Bob in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think I was in most of my year before 2003 , when I still lived there - and I never had any problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in serious !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was used , I never had any problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the contrary , it was more secure than now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Russia , Russia wanted to lead us to the &quot; civil society &quot; but ultimately has thrown us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my eyebrows was exhausted ; I had coloured lashes and I wore tube je@@ ans and short tops .
the Ministry of Security of the Sh@@ aria never got me a hair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny , there was a place where every evening , especially at weekends , a whole group of people like me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people met there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have never been off@@ ended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Che@@ chen language , there is an expression : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t say about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they often say to children if people make fun of himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : so they simply have their eyes closed before you , because they believed that you were sick ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sabrina : yes .
they never ins@@ ul@@ ted me never ch@@ ased and never struck me .
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sabrina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov stood up to the plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he was appointed Minister of Prime Minister in 2005 , he began speaking on television over mor@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was not talking about us , but above the behaviour of women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless - one could feel how the people in the city started to change .
who was laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed at once was susp@@ icious at once .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the Republic constantly wor@@ sen@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : what do you go right now ?
Sabrina : I am working as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I do not earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the United States .
besides that I am still active as a activ@@ ist .
I am currently responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , mer@@ gers , I will accompany them to hospital and help them to get food cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had no p@@ enny for that .
I have discovered these people myself when I cursed them .
I am Muslims and I want to help the people .
OC Media : do you don@@ ate Hid@@ den@@ ab ?
Sabrina : that &apos;s al@@ lied .
nature is the nature that has absolutely nothing to do with religion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ echn@@ ye , who would proph@@ esy with foam from the mouth , that there are no ow@@ ls at them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Da@@ gest@@ ans who have the cab@@ ard@@ iner have , which , the Russians have , too - but on the entire planet they exist - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from there , so it is so unpleasant to hear something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here I meet here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of them are practic@@ ing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during the Ram@@ ad@@ an , live with men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; know , many think in case of transi@@ tions to men who love men , and they believe that they alter@@ n@@ ates his generation to do more intimate experiences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are two different things - two different types of sensation , to be precise , different living settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed of my body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do not know if I have a partner or not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry that I become here personally , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I am not sad at all - I just know that I am myself .
local groups war@@ n against an increase of self @-@ mor@@ ants within the deser@@ ted Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian ancest@@ or region suff@@ ers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last months there has been a strong rise of self @-@ mor@@ ders .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was made available by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ ra@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27th , the desper@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran is characterised by poverty and unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the south @-@ west of Iran .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he suffered under anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness that can come up to his family , like Ah@@ ra@@ az@@ i @-@ human rights that would continue in Ah@@ ra@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a video shared on YouTube kept the moments when he had ign@@ ited himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people succeeded in de@@ gla@@ ze the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the D@@ ingo hospital in the city of Ah@@ ra@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to local sources the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more .
he died short time later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not the only suicide , which has happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority which could take more men to take life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some other - Ham@@ id manifest@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ w Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have hang@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their stories have one thing in common : they were all family @-@ F@@ athers , who felt like persecution from the Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and in@@ capable to feed their families and follow a safe job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the region , in which a large majority of living in Iran living Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community was devast@@ ated by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult for its li@@ vel@@ ih@@ oods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a century BC , the Arab ancestors was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy was taken over and 1925 major efforts to finish ethnic autonomy in all Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Ah@@ ra@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the weal@@ thi@@ est and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly and the native population gets only little from this wealth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is often victim of un@@ treated ill@@ nesses , hunger and emp@@ t@@ ess@@ ments .
the Iranian regime survi@@ ves the ancestors of the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ Arabs to create jobs in the oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government has also built a variety of roofs , which lie in the Persian areas in the Persian areas where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ oma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these roofs have led to devast@@ ation the devast@@ ation in the region and destroy local farming as well as fish and palm trees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ ha@@ w@@ zi teenagers increased now to 81 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian General Director for Co@@ operatives , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , announced that 5 % of the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who have completed a job that ended the primary school and ended 45 % a university degree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a systematic strategy ... that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ az@@ i human rights activ@@ ist based in London , tells Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of poverty , unemployment and ra@@ cial ethnic discrimination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the figure of self @-@ mor@@ phic amongst the young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Doh@@ im@@ i said that especially the unemployment has become more serious . reason for that reason is a combination of a high number of indigenous Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab Dis@@ cri@@ mination in the Adju@@ st@@ ment Process :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since officials and institutions do not pre@@ fers Arab working forces , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will have access to working opportunities in all sectors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , to destroy the spirit of national resistance among young Arabs and to force their living outside its home ancest@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are people who had to change their own and sur@@ name to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , since even Arabic names are not toler@@ ated , for@@ ge the speech of Arabic language or the ear@@ thing of Arabic clothing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; given the circumstances supported by the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , the human rights activ@@ ates the alarm before the situation is explosive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it remains , whether the world is awake and aware of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main reason for suicide is un@@ treated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avo@@ id@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I cannot uni@@ fy with femin@@ ism , also with an inter@@ c@@ tion@@ eer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is a revised version of the opinion , written by Ay@@ om@@ ide and originally published on the website of Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they can be read in the comments under the original text .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I say that I &apos;m not a femin@@ ist , many women , in particular white women , signi@@ fy himself as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wonder@@ ed why I am not part of the movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they even have well thought out scientific and social arguments from me , why I should be a femin@@ ist and why we should be all femin@@ ist * within . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , that women still earn less money in spite of the same education . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are still under strict observ@@ ations , when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that cultural and soci@@ etal standards still ensure that women are facing a glass ceiling earlier or later , and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and religious bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all of this is conscious and aware .
I am convinced of that and I am suffering from double and triple .
I am a black woman .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and yet , when I come to speak on skin color , on black c@@ is women , on black women in the LGB@@ TI community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; on which kind of femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists decided to be silent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but nevertheless they all agree that women - all women - come together , to raise &quot; their voices and sing &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &quot; to reach the equality ( some ) of women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they do not want to talk about sexual violence , in addition to sexu@@ alised violence a institutional form of rac@@ ist violence , which we are exposed to black women over two times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or about the black women and women of other eth@@ n@@ ics and bul@@ let , less deser@@ ve than white men and women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that black girls and girls are often referred to a migration background more often of school than white girls . due to obvious integration problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that women are exposed to a higher risk , domestic violence and violence against a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in a partnership as white women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand I want that all women , all men and all people in any human color have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can take me into account the white woman which ref@@ uses to consider both the gender and skin color of a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am f@@ aint , and I will never fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist orient@@ ated sphere , which always has rejected me and countless other black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 1851 , So@@ jour@@ ner accused 1851 in their speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not a woman yet to su@@ stain me , in which the black woman is a nasty and mar@@ gin@@ alised nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I call me to join group@@ ings which also absorb our customs and customs by cultural ex@@ propri@@ ation to advance their eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will not try to lie down the importance of the over@@ l@@ apping of skin color and gender . because some of them continue to keep the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to anim@@ ate them for a better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the inter@@ se@@ ein@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded , to give women of different backgrounds and dis@@ covering from white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I draw it before me to release me full and totally from femin@@ ism , which was put in life for my dark skin and my status as a woman , which is so persistent as a new phenomenon is celebrated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is more important than ever before , to define black women in our own ideas and set us into the spher@@ es that are created by us for us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book of Afri@@ c@@ ana ( e.g. : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism ) says that we can defend ourselves in this way that we can defend ourselves in that way and in which the spiritual , spiritual , mental , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although some white and inter@@ se@@ ein@@ ous femin@@ ists call upon separ@@ ati@@ sm and exclusion , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and contradi@@ ctions of femin@@ ist movement from which the black woman is concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a v@@ ague environment , I can lift up black women and women of other cultures , as I exist in this para@@ dig@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will be recognized by my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman as part of this para@@ dig@@ m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment where my life is neither ignored , nor ignored , nor rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Paraguay women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women represents &quot; The we@@ eping women , &quot; to express their pain on women &apos;s mor@@ als in the country and in the region to show their re@@ jection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the shortened and processed version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; in articles . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ lich@@ ein@@ z ) who is reported about the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to protect the people concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her own partner who had become violent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the end of her relationship , had passed a little time and the police said , her testimony would be put to the acc@@ ents , but more could you do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a further wife of Bal@@ bu@@ ena , there was nothing more benefited from A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez &apos;s reported advertisement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few days later the second woman moved back to her message .
the v@@ icious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women did not show time at all they won &apos;t get support from the State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in many cases , women are also finan@@ ci@@ ally dependent on women who have mis@@ used it . this explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence , may not be reported at the law en@@ forcement agencies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cont@@ act@@ 1 B@@ oth and Statisti@@ cal 2 In@@ visible abuse and a Judi@@ cial System that contains no under@@ taking 3 Paraguay laws : good approach to poor implementation of pun@@ ches and statistics
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to find how many women are bl@@ am@@ used , My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for Gen@@ der@@ ask at the Centro de Document@@ aci@@ ón y E@@ studio , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various fields and reports that do not even gather the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the figures available are al@@ ar@@ ming however .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the German federal appeal comm@@ its 9@@ 600 ads because of domestic violence . at 70 % of it went violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
86 % of women &apos;s ads came from women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence in the peac@@ eke@@ eping forces . 86 % of women &apos;s ads came here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the ads , 40 % of women discovered that they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of mental abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these statistics show however not the real degree of violence against women in Paraguay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; on each woman who will be reimbur@@ sed in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on each woman who are reimbur@@ sed for physical abuse , there are two women who do not do this , &quot; she explained at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because women &apos;s suicide in Paraguay has not yet been documented , the prosecution authorities cannot appropri@@ ately document how many women were murdered every year by their current or former partners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay has at least 37 cases , in which women were murdered by their current or former partners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to her estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman died due to violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

invisible mi@@ ths and a legal system that does not under@@ takes nothing
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she called his name all her former friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning she did not really want that , but after all , she wanted to repent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old , and not with Carlos together . but for two years she bore some of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult recogni@@ zable : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I never thought I would have become victims of abuse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I read it earlier , I always thought that only women would have happened , because they are deceived by violent men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without name , they wrote articles on Facebook where they described their ins@@ ults and different attacks during their two @-@ year relationship , and told how he isolated them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people answered against their posts , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ish if he ever had raised the hand against her and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why they had fallen for so long by Carlos and didn &apos;t leave him earlier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it almost seemed so , as wanted to say that sacrifice of abuse at least had some blame . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria Santos , which is not from Paraguay , fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner is mi@@ stre@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; I think you &quot; ) that consists of women that are all in any way victims of abuse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the group , they can speak with others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything started with mental abuse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your prosper@@ ous partner finally managed to convince her to convince her , that she was worth@@ less . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he began to beat them .
Vict@@ ori@@ as adverti@@ se@@ ments in the authorities without a result and also from its relatives . she won &apos;t receive support .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it led a trial against its former partner who developed into an un@@ predic@@ table legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was primarily about money , power and influence of their former partner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Paraguay La@@ ws : good approach to poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the display of abuse is a way full of resi@@ stances and a struggle against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; said Victoria Santos .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , sees great problems in the application of laws in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 August 2016 a bill of legislative revision was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ell@@ as ( # Princip@@ le ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Una@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ L@@ ess ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original draft of the law looks before , to explain Fem@@ ale to a distinct off@@ ense and pun@@ ish how it is already in neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some points , the bills has been changed in some points in order to be punished for the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions that are actually forbidden in Paraguay and can be punished by up to five years in prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initial bill of law intended to bear the majority of the ( bureaucra@@ tic and economic ) travel costs which currently have to carry on the victims of violence , and wish to receive safe accommodation within the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law does not effectively be effective if the legis@@ l@@ ature does not provide sufficient financial means at our disposal :
in Paraguay mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment as part of human relationships is seen .
a change must take place so that violence is no longer considered as a bit of standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who are silent in the face of these facts , contribut@@ ing to the perpet@@ rators of the perpet@@ rators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to reimbur@@ se so long ad , until mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment do not apply to normal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Senate . previously , parts of the law have been changed . among others , a passage was painted , which called on the partner in cases of domestic violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
opinions on the changes go apart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the passage concerning reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor , to attack his victim again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cancellation of the words &quot; gender &quot; , &quot; political power &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; in parts of the law however , is considered a great set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media in Oman one year after the ban of a newspaper continued assault
&quot; this website has been locked because of a decision of the information minister &quot; was read on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than a year ago , the Afghan authorities opened an independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n due to its reporting on corruption in the sult@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper was still in prison where he served a prison sentence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and zah@@ er Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , were also arrested and tried in court later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 when he had his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur by a coup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , alongside his role as the only Sultan , he held the main offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Minister of Defense , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Minister of Foreign Affairs , President of the Central Bank and President of the Central Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rule of sult@@ ans is marked by the per@@ sever@@ ance efforts of security forces , the public liber@@ ties , including press freedom , restri@@ cts and defense def@@ ending , independent journalists , blog@@ gers and other activists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authorities restri@@ ct peaceful and legitimate activity in the field of human rights , even activists , even activists from their views on the public matters of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the assault on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , their closure and arrest of three of their editors last year is a hard blow for the freedom of press in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper that has been reported in the Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) since its creation in 2007 until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , chief editor of Az@@ am@@ n , held an article by the title &quot; High @-@ Level parties &quot; Hands after the Justice &quot; and the interference of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report , government officials became accused of raising judges of the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure to rise in a sentence of her@@ edi@@ tary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 3 August 2016 , he was arrested in Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , Member of the editorial committee before the Special Department and arrested on his arrival from the security forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS joined the vice @-@ editor at You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as Chief Editor after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper was concluded on an in@@ definite period , after the Information Minister had given the statement that &quot; the publication and dissemin@@ ation of the newspaper on any other way , including online , will be banned from 9 August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Ab@@ ri took place in Mas@@ kat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tribunal sentenced three journalists to prison , and ordered the final closing of the newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convicted of inter@@ ruption of public order , mis@@ use of the internet &quot; and &quot; grave of the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of violation of a public ban and s@@ lander was found guilty .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three year prison pun@@ ishments and fin@@ ishers in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) in addition to a one @-@ year job ban against the two journalists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; al @-@ Ab@@ ri was sentenced to a year jail plus a fine of 1000 cast@@ al ( 2600 USD ) , having found a threat to the public order &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a threat to public order might be found guilty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , a damages deposit of 5,000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) was set and was released from prison on 22 August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the App@@ eals Chamber increased al @-@ Ab@@ ri in a hearing on December 26 , 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after sitting out of his six month sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ me@@ g . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he served his own sentence .
the App@@ eals Court also highlighted the decision of the Department of Information on the &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n , the paper sees itself out of attacks by the Peruvian government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on January 8th , the Minister of Information left an order , with which the closure of &quot; az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended for three months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information was personally signed by another order in which the Ministers of the &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was renewed for three additional months and thereby presented the Minister for the decision of the Court of App@@ eal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which Oman has been hurt in Oman .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to stop its operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of journalists Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the om@@ anic authorities are still not willing to make an end to an extensive injury to the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ anic authorities : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally free of release ;
2 . a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n to create so that their journalists can follow their work ;
3 . to protect the freedom of press in the country and
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 4 . under all circumstances , human rights and journalists in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including the judicial system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Golf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organisation , supporting human rights defence ( also independent journalists , dat@@ alog@@ gers , lawyers etc . ) in the Gulf region and in adjacent countries to gather peac@@ efully and provide them protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with his agreement
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; medical research in Africa is only rarely or even mentioned in the media , it is an increasing area addressed to one of the most urgent needs of the continent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two reasons for the required medical research on site . many medicines and vacc@@ ines are lacking in the offer of global healthcare , which cover special medical requirements on the African continent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ culosis and mal@@ aria have a major problem in the p@@ oo@@ rest countries of Africa , and lack of investment for research through the pharmaceutical companies are a big problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secon@@ dly , research that carried out by African scientists will help to develop its own research capacity in Africa . a greater role in science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is director of the Centre for Expl@@ oration of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ec@@ tious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the 1990s , he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , to present the first serious impact on national health . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Louisiana , and later in Indiana . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a post@@ doctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania he himself resear@@ ched on HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ic health system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed about the future of medical research in Zambia , and mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( home@@ work : Dr. War@@ rier talks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ ri@@ cher : at the moment the focus of my work is on the use of research results . I support the sam@@ b@@ ari@@ al national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides , I just started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ V : what are your opinion of the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we are only putting solutions that have been developed somewhere else .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must change , otherwise we will always be recipi@@ ents instead of being mo@@ vers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the solutions that we get , are often not good in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use it here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ V : where does funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from USA and Europe .
the projects are being promoted differently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s difficult to find people who come back or go here , because the financing and development chances are better in other countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ V : how is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research project which you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to standards in developed countries . it costs much money to have continuous power with electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
G@@ V : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest in it but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods were taught in schools in order to improve the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ V : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus and how can we support the development ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all age classes .
there is need of special scientific training . starting at each age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , research on space , healthcare ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ V : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as a scientist in Africa , compared to Western countries , based on your experience ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; RW : often they are the limited speed , things to do and the access to scientific expertise , which represent challenges here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the system , that magazines may only make available for payment ( called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , limit@@ ing the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the U.S. to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers can change global food production
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website of En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which covers solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Frank M@@ orton was bred a let@@ tu@@ ce in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its company offers 114 varieties , like Out@@ red@@ der , the first plant which was grown by NASA astr@@ on@@ aut around the space and has been consumed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mort@@ ons work was only about 20 years , just by its own accident @-@ wealth and the question how many salads can get borders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but at the beginning of the 2000 , he noticed that more and more salads was patented and that he could not continue to use them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the patents were not only for individual sorts , but also for certain characteristics like resistance to ill@@ nesses , a special red or green or g@@ asp@@ hal@@ ed leaves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years , more such patents have been registered in more plants like cer@@ eal or cart@@ ons . because of this trends , plant bree@@ ders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts provide food security to the future of food production . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a passionate representative of a m@@ illen@@ nia @-@ old tradition M@@ orton is still breeding salad , he needs to do so much longer since his work is increasingly difficult and more restrictions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s like I would have a b@@ oul@@ der in a river which I must play .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do that now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents are going to go far too far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if they stand before the court , no one can breed a new Sal@@ at@@ sor@@ te because all the features are already patented and tried to elabor@@ ate those characteristics which he wants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is very careful and stri@@ ves to use no material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also joined a movement which is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; Bre@@ eding ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; astr@@ on@@ aut of the astr@@ onau@@ ts of the International Space Station , red Rö@@ mer@@ sal@@ at the Sor@@ te Out@@ red@@ der was bred and eaten , where plants can be cultivated in space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not acci@@ dental that this name sounds like that , than would come from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; Open Source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copyright protected software . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was called in life to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property , and so for plant bree@@ ders permanently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of the initiative , called O@@ ssi , US gro@@ wers may agree that others may use the seeds produced by them freely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it does not mean that they do not continue to store operations and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bree@@ ders allow you to cross so own species to breed it , and it cannot be forbidden or prescribed by many plant pat@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dozens of bree@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the accredited Professor at University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and O@@ ssi @-@ board Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over seeds and opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to seed , he plays a role in greater cont@@ ex@@ ts like biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the nutrition and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eder would try to breed the latter or only tasty with natural resistance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not work with gene@@ tically modified plants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not to be announced on the global agricultural industry . &quot; those who are offered by ecological agriculture and from Mon@@ santo and Mon@@ santo and Bayer , will also know that the way is grown on how this vegetables is cultivated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
food sovereign without seed sound is not possible . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed initiative relate to others their seed must be freely available . in contrast , their approach is to pat@@ ent@@ ate seed and plant characteristics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo of Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ssi supporters may argue that the future of food supply is endangered , since the available gen@@ pool is based on plant material , which therefore always needs more re@@ adily available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Claire Lu@@ by , Executive Director of O@@ ssi , committed themselves in their PhD thesis in car@@ rot and their availability , which means that roughly one @-@ third of all the handling characteristics is intellectual property , whereby it is available for plant bree@@ ders either at all or only difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for other plants there are still not such estimates , but experts like Lu@@ by ob@@ struc@@ ts that large plants were found as wheat in even wider style as a salad or carrots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a question of view
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plants are grown in such a way that they have specifically designed specifically @-@ specific characteristics - such as their taste or colour , due to which they prosp@@ er in certain environments and resist threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opponents of patents on plant characteristics indicate that the available plant material for bree@@ ders separated by more patents , but nowadays the changing conditions are much worse than ever since the changing conditions are much worse than ever . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an email , Mon@@ santo &apos;s Car@@ ly Sc@@ adu@@ ct will acknowledge that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with altogether four banks and cooperation with institutions like the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company set for conservation of genetic diversity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she does not contradi@@ ct that mind , however , that the intellectual property also promote other bree@@ ders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ etal innovations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically taken up as soon as the patent expi@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method to come to the same result .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such a protection does not inhi@@ bits innovation , but promotes knowledge by being made available to the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
M@@ orton looks differently : 20 years for waiting until a patent has been running , don &apos;t transporting innovations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you have to wait so long to breed in plants , which have been adapted to the modified environmental conditions , one should have lost the struggle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the main argument for M@@ orton is , however , that genetic resources should always have been a general well and it should remain : &quot; independent plant bree@@ ders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incen@@ tives are not attractive for us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to make farmers easier for their jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is what ru@@ bs us , and it will not be made to us if we cannot continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; altogether , M@@ orton joins the concept to pat@@ enting plant features : &quot; we do not create the features really themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plants form them themselves , and as bre@@ eder we have no idea how the plants do this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the U.S. State Oregon and O@@ ssi on board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; those who bred a variety and propag@@ ates its own values into it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who believes in industrial agriculture with large cour@@ ty@@ ards and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , for their cultivation , her@@ b@@ ici@@ des are needed , breeding in its varieties of this concept of agriculture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my concept is precisely in principle . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that are moving on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ santo are ) patents , it will create the most smaller seed companies - either lean or hold it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding , or both are the case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

M@@ orton is also the view that bre@@ eder is highly innovative by the A@@ void of plant pat@@ ors : &quot; it looks like that I am with my efforts to produce new and stronger than the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I need new material for my catalogue , as I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a few years of competition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent it is possible to make it pretty easy for 20 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worldwide resonance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the US seems to be a leader in the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding , the concept is now spreading quickly around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in India the centre for sustainable agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which itself describes itself as professional organisation in the field of resources , is working with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet specific requirements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to get on &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German organisation of col works on an &quot; Open Source &quot; license , which ultimately has a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ssi for bree@@ ders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( regulations for the bree@@ ders differ from country to country , which cannot simply be taken over by one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in early November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be patented . this means that the plant based on conven@@ tionally bred plants is not allowed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , such a statement is not a law ; now it is to bring to governments of the Member States to implement the Patent Office to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems from across East Africa to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards the re@@ orientation of seeds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems declar@@ es that the organization is currently establishing a worldwide alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , which will fall next year for the official starting signal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a combination of environmental protection and development groups ( among them Hi@@ v@@ os ) and the action group on ero@@ sion , technology and Con@@ cent@@ ration ) has compiled a database for seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September , Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a group of relief organisations like the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - to contribute to seeds and ensure a stable supply with food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report the importance of a diverse , local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems emphas@@ ises that soon more people can recognize him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has grown mainly on the matter where and how something is grown , and seed systems have barely given a role to make people clear that there is still more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approximately one @-@ fifth of the participating countries in Central and Eastern Europe , including Bulgaria , has been reported at the national competition in a former Global Vo@@ ices article . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
human rights organisation and blog are the latest targets of C@@ ens@@ orship in Egypt
still locking the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the weekend of the 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government held the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , that documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in August , the network published a statement on Facebook where there were sharply critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step , and promised the work and effort for human rights in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information abide in spite of this attack and the constitution of the Egyptian Law and the constitution of the Egyptian world , it was never so important to overcome these goals in order to overcome the ob@@ struction and do not release it . we wait for continuing to continue our task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is regarded as the first cen@@ sored web site of a human rights organisation in Egypt , among others the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ language edition of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and Qatar @-@ speaking Network of Al Jazeera because of alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights researchers Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada do not have access to Egypt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ ada made his blog for the spread of columns and articles , which he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the blog was built to handle the Egyptian government to handle the Egyptian government itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blog@@ ger , the provider , which is also home to the Zi@@ adas blog , is currently accessible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , while he was arrested by Egyptian security forces , while he took over the student prot@@ agonist and a video on how the police trained violence against two students . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his article mainly revol@@ ve about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a Facebook statement , Zi@@ ada testi@@ fied about the government and reflected what this means to him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 ) It has succeeded in giving me the feeling of a state of siege ; an arrest , an attemp@@ ted murder , pre @-@ charging of the national Security Council , the blocking blogs and any other web site for which I worked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2 ) You proved that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , although only on a small audience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post articles in order to b@@ ypass the c@@ ens@@ orship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , after they have blocked him and that they can &apos;t be afraid of words , I still can change the link or create a second blog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the mu@@ gs go the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and expression ( AF@@ TE ) locked Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) including orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AF@@ TE has also documented the blocking of suppliers , by trans@@ forming Internet search and private surfing , so @-@ called virtual private networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Monday , June 12 , we felt like the blocking of websites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s began . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such a practice refers to the government intent to block content and to filter content , to which Egyptian user might have access . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation is additionally intensi@@ fied by the closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis until the Egyptian population has no legal basis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ orship , and who will attack it next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the local people are fighting .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; day for day reports newspapers in whole Brazil with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city of the country and home of numerous postcards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are loud as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old was shot in school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In the second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is assassin@@ ated , &quot; &quot; President T@@ emer sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Marine and Air af@@ ee to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a cl@@ amped financial situation , the force of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports such as these are all day and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is how the detailed reporting about violence in Rio known newspapers , &quot; Extra &quot; on 16 August , &quot; This is not normal ; &quot; in which they sinned , a new column called &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the motive for her decision declared the paper so :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra will continue to report about crime which differs in every big city on the world as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexu@@ al@@ vom@@ iting , etc . everything , which is published by the civili@@ zed standard and what only occurs in Rio , is not normal ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the only alternative that we do not exclu@@ de our eyes before cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , that this decision not cause pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra is probably the only newspaper around the world , with a war in war in a country that does not recognize the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to information of the institute for internal security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 , that of criminal organisations will be controlled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the article he writes up the newspaper :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware that a war bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy used when it is being distor@@ ted , even the police , who will first shoot at first and then ask questions to tu@@ ck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of ma@@ fia and its partners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the term &quot; war &quot; more than they used ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an article on the Inter@@ cept Brasi@@ l journalist , journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira argu@@ ed that violence as &quot; war &quot; refers to a jus@@ tification of security policy by the media , and it might be difficult to draw the persons responsible for the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is no war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as being shown with the analysis of military interest rates in Rio , in combination with in@@ sufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ wearing negle@@ ct of public service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reminder : the State of Rio de Janeiro is greater than just its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro is the most recent data in Brazil according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities are located in the State of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we view M@@ ord@@ rates per State , Rio is located on No. 16 , &quot; writes them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , emphas@@ ises the security policy of the State of South America for years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these security policies , the foundation of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the federal state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer a fav@@ ela . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initially this had actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . for a few years , the U@@ PP continued to protect the poor communities and repression against the poor communities , who should actually protect the newly created police unit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on his Facebook page , journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux quoted him from his article in 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio is not equal to the criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio , as war , draws heavily on consequences for human beings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this demands the state which is typical for a war , which is typical for a war . among which a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and for the object for a collapse of collapse &quot; and &quot; distor@@ ted bul@@ lets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war , or her , fact is that the inhabitants of fav@@ el@@ as in Rio continues to suffer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one week ago , it is now that the police cleared the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho , in order to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the midst of all this force , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit ta@@ iler died as a result of shooting who killed the police from a helicopter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

to stay alive : besi@@ eged Syrians learn to plant mushrooms
screenshot of the Advertising video .
source : Can@@ wick Action
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the Syrian Revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from violent siege and block@@ ades , mainly by Assad &apos;s regime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to victories Watch , a joint initiative by the Peace Organization PA@@ X and the Research Institute of Syria , D@@ eir E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the region of East G@@ hou@@ ta is particularly strong , where an attack with chemical weapons called hundreds of civilians on August 21st 2013 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition come from it , based on investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre of Assad &apos;s regime was practiced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2013 , these areas controlled by rebels have stood outside of Damascus that led people on local or through tun@@ nels or tun@@ nels and control points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the years of long block@@ ade , traditional foods are as at@@ tain@@ able as meat become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a return , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and ac@@ adem@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ t@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and conduct the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ h@@ rooms are not one of the traditional ones in Syria , but they are extremely rare part of the Syrian kitchen . its food makes it an attractive food source for many residents of the besi@@ eged west G@@ hou@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the project , Ab@@ o Nabil Sanad said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we op@@ ted for the cultivation of mushroom , because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ahmed L@@ eil@@ a , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that began to announce this project and pressed his relief that it now gains more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to gather money for the initiative , use the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da the humanitarian funding platform Can@@ Do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is planned to con@@ vey 125 families of education to plant@@ ing mushrooms such as Dr. L@@ eil@@ a at Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the time of the constitution of this article they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect funds on Can@@ Do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is dependent on generators , which maintain the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the fuel short@@ age , locally produced plastics are used in order to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. L@@ eil@@ a said Global Vo@@ ices That they began with the &quot; production of &quot; the fung@@ al seeds , before they checked their quality and they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom in a tub . when this was accomplished that they used a larger tub . and so on .
we now have a &quot; apprentic@@ eship yard for the region . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the project and after another 3 months , they have been divided mushrooms everywhere in East G@@ hou@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; we want to contribute to the fung@@ al breeding of various reasons : &quot; fra@@ ction of the siege .
providing a new source of food on the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency , by food resi@@ due ( like paper , tea , coffee kit , cardboard , etc . ) for obtaining a food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating new job opportunities ; especially for women working at home .
to create new jobs for people with disabilities who are bound to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; We hope to spread this idea throughout the world , giving our success as well as our fight against hunger and siege . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to inspire our experience people in crisis regions and we can help people . &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several hundred people were prot@@ ested in many districts in Portugal on October 21st , seeking justice for the victims of fires that were gra@@ zed in the north of Portugal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two and forty people died and about 70 were injured as a consequence of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this resulted in the last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state of mour@@ ning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fires were also registered in the area of Gal@@ icia in Spain , where there were 4 dead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is estimated that there were over 500 fire out@@ breaks , spread across northern and central regions of the country and reached some 250 million hectares of woods and numerous villages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June , a similar tragedy happened in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the European forest conservation system that monitors the forest areas by satellite , only 500,000 acres of forests are burned in Portugal - an area of the size of the Lisbon district . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of Ernst of the location : there is no fire in 4 districts .

numerous videos are spreading on the net and display images that allow a better insight into the action :
the predic@@ table tragedy
the objective of protests from Saturday was the demand for better pre@@ ven@@ ous and fire fighting measures through the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people asked , why the civil protection wasn &apos;t able to beat the extent of the tragedy as far as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
João So@@ ver@@ al of the federal government of Portugal explained the p@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o newspaper :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão streets and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did it nowhere : there are dozens of open roads surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria a similar tragedy would have happened , as in June , the streets were locked very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
further building permits are in@@ scri@@ bed in oil fes@@ tivities with high level of fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an in@@ sufficient proposal for the roll form , which the government had applied after severe fires in 2003 and 2005 , was ob@@ jected by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obst@@ acle to investments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government led a relaxing of the law which allowed the construction activity , if the applicant was dispos@@ ed of means of means of self protection , João Sor@@ val went further out in the same article in the newspaper p@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the landscape sho@@ ots made it attentive to large surfaces with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of easily combus@@ tible wood , like in a v@@ icious circle , according to fires of this type . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on these issues , the site of the Ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ards of Portugal on 15 and 16 October was seeking as a local information or tried to contact persons that was offline . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a private initiative which provided the population with information , using the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time via the location and spreading the fires . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the project was established in 2015 by the developer of the fire brig@@ ade to simplify work and was so important at this fat@@ eful weekend in October , the fires did not resist : but the site had more than half a million requests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one night in autumn 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began through the Taliban . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the different Mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in group@@ ings which conquered the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan has become a land of terror and desp@@ air . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , participated in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central America for the last time with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if his mother wasn &apos;t so at that time , she knew her son would no longer see her son - maybe even more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boy was supposed to break up in the dawn .
his un@@ cle would pick it up and bring him to the tow .

the Taliban known for its hatred on Haz@@ ara became increasingly closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then he took what was left of his small wage , and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and tow@@ ed s@@ acks with mort@@ ar , who were heavier than he himself to earn his li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was influenced by mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in a standing building on the building site , which we worked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no services there and no heater . we hung nylon before the open windows that we do not freeze at night . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af made his life without papers in Iran and ready for travel to Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the dangerous dri@@ v@@ eway on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wreck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some time A@@ vo@@ af homeless was homeless , and ran through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church dedicated to food twice a day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that Italy is a second second chance for previous asylum seek@@ ers . it &apos;s right , however , that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers are inv@@ oked in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Civil Code of Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes : the system &quot; suff@@ ers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; special Recording centres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are impro@@ vised by impro@@ vised institutions in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to a reception centre , if they officially apply for asylum request under registration of asylum request . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until then people who have no money for accommodation , must rely on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like so it was A@@ vo@@ af .
but his un@@ adul@@ ter@@ ated li@@ fel@@ ine helped A@@ shar@@ k to free himself out of these conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after he had made various work in construction for several years , A@@ shar@@ af hired its entire savings into the foundation of a hostel in Venice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was so good , that after a while , after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast afternoon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ vo@@ af Bar@@ ati@@ s success story is a topic of the &quot; han@@ d Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wah@@ i@@ di .
the film was awarded the Venice City Award for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepren@@ eurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Italian - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only a few of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates around 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many of them , the country is a transition solution in other European countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years some of Afghan companies , including tail@@ or , travel agents , hotels and restaurants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some af@@ gh@@ ing restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for its excellent cuisine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ di had the idea to his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iter and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the menu of the restaurant is telling the history of their journey to Italy by the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ vo@@ af@@ s are , however , far beyond Italian food industries and retail , and aim to go back to the country that he had to leave home as a teen@@ ager . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; where a risk is ? &quot; says A@@ vo@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never forgotten my country , and I can &apos;t live when I know that my people are suffering . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I plan a project for farmers from the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of the country and especially for women .
they represent half of society and have to get the same potential as all others . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ vo@@ af for@@ ge plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul , where people can buy packaging and preservation techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can sell their harvest over@@ flows on the market and improve their financial situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; developing the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end there are stability and prosperity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ vo@@ af has made this journey itself , and now he wants to help other Afghanistan on this road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ ti@@ zen report is an international snap@@ shot that shows challenges , victories and upcoming trends in the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian parliament reviewed a bill of bill , that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a government authority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; users would need to register in order to use social networks , register within six months of the authority of the authority by speci@@ fying its full name and ID number . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever distingu@@ ishes this step , would be sentenced to six months &quot; imprisonment or a vocation of a criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law , which was recru@@ ited by sixty members of Parliament , is currently on legislative and constitutional committee in the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May , a further deputy for a law@@ suit was filed , in the tough@@ er stra@@ tification for the ins@@ ult of the President or a high civil servants would be introduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under Egyptian law , the ins@@ ul@@ ance of the president and state institutions are already criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should the law be approved , this can be up to three years in prison for the convicted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of freedom has been in danger for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) , who used the polic@@ eman from demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against military coup against the president Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , as more than 700 protest participants , who had been arrested at the same incident , four years in prison on a trial date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently his sentence was post@@ pon@@ ed on 20 May , because the prison management failed to bring the accused by the prison in the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the penalty of death due to , so many human rights groups are embar@@ rass@@ ed , sh@@ em@@ ming of other arms , illegal assembly , murder and murder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary was charged for their coverage on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court also reduced the pun@@ ishments of journalists Abdullah al @-@ F@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly who were also arrested at the previous incident at the age of 25 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tun@@ es@@ ischer activists to listen through documents
in May the Tun@@ isian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia - who co @-@ founded the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at as well as the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly supported by the presi@@ dents of the Republic , according to the president of the Republic , according to the dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali the corruption of acc@@ laim@@ ed officials will return . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the document issued on April 21st on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , casts a light how the forma@@ tive plans look to support the bill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ben G@@ har@@ bia declined the disclosure of his sources under indication of Article 11 of the Tun@@ isian press de@@ xes . journalists have the right to protect their sources .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , in the District Court in Tunis , on 9th May , he was a witness in the fall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does China want to force social media to present their identity ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the new rules of information office of the People &apos;s Republic of China , social media in China need approval before they write or share news in social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the rules , it is also indicated that the registration will be required with the full re@@ ordering name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; analy@@ st assume that by the elim@@ ination of anonymous comments within the social networks , it is still un@@ clear how the authorities apply these regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chinese power has proposed in social media to protect these regulations only , to protect citizens journ@@ alism and independence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
in May the state c@@ ens@@ orship of Russia disappeared the access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging App We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat to register as &quot; organis@@ er of the information dissemin@@ ation &quot; in state government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this identi@@ fying is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government guides a list of online services that will be responsible for removing content and force them on request to remove information data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to these websites are currently web pages such as V@@ contacted and Od@@ no@@ by@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two popular social networks ) . the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail and dozens of other services .
Turkish court comes to Wikipedi@@ as
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Turkish court found the lock of terr@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administr@@ ators refused to delete two English @-@ language items to support the jihadists in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication has been locked to do the site , because they cooperate with groups to send a political diff@@ usion campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first time that Turkey has been completely blocked by Turkey . besides , China , one of the few countries worldwide in which access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
