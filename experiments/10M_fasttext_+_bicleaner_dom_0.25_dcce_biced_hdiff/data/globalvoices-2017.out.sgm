<seg id="2181">The following article is the modified version of the "lovemaking" lovemulation to guerrilla fighters who published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>

<seg id="2186">Only recently was their land of an historical event and they wanted to contribute to this part: after years of negotiations the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the Guerillationary FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces in Colombia).</seg>

<seg id="2190">"" "" "" "the Colombian society in turn, which was accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases opposed to guerrilla fighters, must support them in their ranks and support them in building a new life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young columbikers had to come together and assist with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And just this they did: until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to the former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>

<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the Reconciliation was initiated at the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Prize committee which took place in February 2017 in BogotÃ¡. there they had been a chance to speak to the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 with Kailash Satyarthi.</seg>

<seg id="2199">Up to now more than 2000 letters were collected during the campaign.</seg>
