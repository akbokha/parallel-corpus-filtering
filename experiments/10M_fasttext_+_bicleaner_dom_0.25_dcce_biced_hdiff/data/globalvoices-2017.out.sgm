<seg id="2181">The following article is the modified version of the "lovemaking" lovemulation to guerrilla fighters who published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The report will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>

<seg id="2185">This question was exactly what the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga of the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios were inspired by the Young Youth Foundation and inspired her to write guerrilla fighters to write guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently was their land of an historical event and they wanted to contribute to this part: after years of negotiations the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the Guerillationary FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces in Colombia).</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was for the signing of the peace agreement as so significant that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos received a Nobel Peace Prize for his contributions to the Nobel Peace Prize.</seg>

<seg id="2190">"" "" "" "the Colombian society in turn, which was accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases opposed to guerrilla fighters, must support them in their ranks and support them in building a new life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young columbikers had to come together and assist with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And just this they did: until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to the former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">"" "" "" "the goal of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla fighters, who will then be handed over personally." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the Reconciliation was initiated at the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Prize committee which took place in February 2017 in Bogotá. there they had been a chance to speak to the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 with Kailash Satyarthi.</seg>
<seg id="2196">"" "" "" "this explained that we write the people who love to write thousands of love letters in Valentine's Day, but those who need them much needed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2197">"" "" "" "he plan, he told him to share his love with people who needed the most urgent commitment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2198">"" "" "" "so the plan was created to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of FARC to show their place in society and to make their discourse from a war story to a common history of peace," they say. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2199">Up to now more than 2000 letters were collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">"" "" "" "the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I never thought that someone would forgive me '</seg>
