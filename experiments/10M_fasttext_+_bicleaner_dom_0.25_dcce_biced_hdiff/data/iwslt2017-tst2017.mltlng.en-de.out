this is James R@@ isen .
they perhaps know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New @-@ York Times repor@@ ter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long before someone had heard by Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book , in which he published spectacular teleph@@ ones of Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there is another chapter , that should leave a permanent impression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this , he describes a disast@@ rous US secret operation , in which the CIA was literally handed over to Iran for an atomic bomb . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if that sounds crazy you can read it .
it &apos;s an incredible story .
but you don &apos;t know whom the chapter didn &apos;t like ?
the US government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for almost 10 years , the government against R@@ isen has determined and asked him to call his alleged springs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this train , he became a symbol of the patterns of the government , W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and war@@ med journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the First Constitutional atz , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the mu@@ gs they give identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so when the government was kno@@ cked , he did something that many brave repor@@ ters did before him : he refused , and said that he would prefer to go into prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk to enter prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , just days before the process , something extraordinary happens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , though they were for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of government forces were dropped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic surveillance the Rep@@ orter and S@@ ources are hiding less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of fail@@ ing and f@@ ou@@ ting to the statements , this could also carry out its digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his agreement , had wor@@ shi@@ ped his phone secretly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just like its e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , its credit points , and even travel hints with the list of its flights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to share , Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA wine @-@ b@@ lower and ris@@ tian source . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , but instead , justice has condemned the judi@@ ci@@ ary than all US governments before him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is too much appreciated by her work as a secret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of that a W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers went to a journalist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we put the PR about the game that should be protected by the first constitu@@ ency , because the government has more possibilities to come off all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but just like the technology of the government , the media rights can use the rights to protect their sources better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and indeed , they can accept that from the moment in which they contact you rather than in the picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , there are communication software that hasn &apos;t been written as R@@ isen had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such a technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source transition system for W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers that was developed by us from Freedom of the Press Foundation , and is today developed by Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of send an e @-@ mail , go to a news @-@ site , just like the Washington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there you can upload documents or send information such as in any ordinary contact form .
they will then be encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the government cannot secretly accept information secretly , and many of the information that would claim they would not be available from the out@@ set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is but only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of press in the 21st century .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , governments around the world develop new spy technologies that all end@@ anger ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is to ensure that not only technology leader , like Edward Snow@@ den have a chance to share their ini@@ qui@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is just as important to protect the next W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disp@@ ropor@@ tion@@ ate about the problems in the supply of soldiers . or to the next environmental member@@ ships , the alarm suggests about contaminated water of f@@ rif@@ le . or a wall of wall in@@ sider which war@@ ns us against the next financial crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , these technologies were not only made for those who want to un@@ cover crime , but to protect our constitu@@ ency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the biggest data le@@ ck of the story was published . &#93; &#91; the Panama &apos;s Pap@@ ers &quot; reveal that Rei@@ che and Mäch@@ ler &#93; &#91; enormous money sum@@ s have been hidden by Global Wit@@ ness about a declaration . &#93; This week we were found by news about a len@@ eck of 11 million documents in Panama &apos;s resident law
the publication of these documents give a gli@@ mpse into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers to companies such as Mos@@ sack Fon@@ se@@ ca do and say , &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you do it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we actually see emails , the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Islands Prime Minister has re@@ signed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , there are reports that a ally of brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad has brief@@ ing firms in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is said that a trace of 2 billion US dollars on Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin will lead to a close friend of children days , a famous cell@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people and others who are waiting for the next release , and to the next release documents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , sounds like the plot of a community , or John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it seems we@@ eping from you to me and ordinary people .
why should that be ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their fortune in tax@@ o@@ ases and not all pay their taxes , then this means less money for major public services such as health care , education , streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that concerns us all .
there is phenom@@ enal by my organization , global Wit@@ ness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all over the world , media and leading politicians will discuss how secret tax v@@ ases of some few have been used to hide their fortune and to wear it -- something we have been discuss@@ ing and reveal it for ten years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think many people seem to conf@@ using this whole world and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I put it in front of me like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we have a company in another company , in another company which makes it almost impossible to really understand who behind these prayers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities , as well as journalists or civil society really to understand what matters is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it interesting also , that there are fewer reports about this matter in the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presumably , because there has been no prominent Americans in this sc@@ andal in this sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is not the case that there are no rich Americans , who are hiding their fortune in tax ha@@ v@@ ases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , by the principle of working the tax ha@@ v@@ ens , Mos@@ el has less American customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we would have a data le@@ ck of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples that have the connections to the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , it is possible that in some US states you need to add less information to establish a company than to get a library card . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this type of in@@ transparency in the USA has allowed employees of school areas to cover school@@ children .
it has allowed che@@ ers to cover especially sus@@ cep@@ tible investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it actually work ?
so we sent a conc@@ e@@ aled heir to the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our investig@@ ator gave himself as prime minister , who wanted to bring susp@@ ect money into the U.S. to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are really shocked , that everyone might make suggestions for a lawyer , how he could transfer his money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were all pre@@ ten@@ ants . none of these lawyers won us as a client , and of course nothing was handed over to cash . but it shows the problem with this system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is also important to regard it as single cases .
it &apos;s not about a single lawyer that has made suggestions for our conc@@ e@@ aled Er@@ ilit@@ ator .
it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian in a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a matter of how the system works , by corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to overcome this we have to change the rules .
we must change the rules to make this sort of behavior difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this may sound very dec@@ ep@@ tive , as if we could do nothing but if nothing has ever changed ; as if it is always the rich and the powerful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but as a born optim@@ ist I see that a lot has begun to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years , we have seen fol@@ ks to more transparency , which concerns the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , the EU &apos;s central regi@@ sters at national level , who really is behind companies in Europe , and who controls it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the un@@ comfortable facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
representatives of both parties have brought a bill of bill in both par@@ liament@@ arians but this does not make progress we would like to see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we would really like to see how these Panama @-@ revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , used as a means to ensure more transparency in the US and globally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need ordinary people who become angry if they see , how other people can hide their true identity behind p@@ seu@@ do@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need managers in the economy that stand up and say : &quot; In@@ transparent &quot; is not good for business . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians to recognize the problem , and use it to end this type of in@@ transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally finish the in@@ transparency , which now allow this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story as I have been kidn@@ apped once and in the boot space of a red Maz@@ da .
after a day after I completed my design studies I made a back yard .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my point .
he bought one of my works .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was alone in the city , and made a road trip through the whole land . after that , he would go to the peace of peace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I asked him for a beer , and he told me how he wanted to change the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where are you asleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I just got to know him ! he says that he would go to the peace of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans . I don &apos;t want to land in the luggage boot of a Maz@@ da ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a small trunk !
then I heard my saying : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
a voice at my head said : &quot; Ah , how please ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at night , I was lying in bed , I fro@@ ze on the ceiling , thought : &quot; Oh man ! what haven &apos;t I introduced to myself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an alien sleeps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I got such a fear that I went out of bed to close to the door , and closed my sleeping door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he wasn &apos;t crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the artwork which he had bought by me , is today in his class@@ room . he is now teacher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my viewpoint .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps people who were sold to me as a stranger , were friends who were waiting for him to be discovered ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we &apos;ll do a leap year two years later ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my ro@@ omm@@ ates pul@@ ls out and the rent is increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that there was a design conference in the city at the time , and all hotels were booked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think creativity can make it possible to transform fear into fun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wrote to my best friend and ro@@ omm@@ ate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I &apos;ve discovered how we could deser@@ ve something . our apartment is included with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including a mattress and a complimentary breakfast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a site and established &apos; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests could sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air mattress surface .
they found it super and we too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sure , our cheese @-@ ham O@@ mel@@ et tasted completely different because we did for our guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and passed the door into the castle , Brian and I joined us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
had we discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came into rolls .
my former ro@@ omm@@ ate to N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk secured us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if one could make it a business concept .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we presented ourselves to investors : &quot; we want to create a website on the people publicly sponsored by their private bedrooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms , the doors , whose doors are closed when visiting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the Internet , they can invite many foreign people to stay with them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the rocket would ign@@ ite .
but they do not act .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one who is still with comfort would invest in a business , which allows strangers to sleep in flats of other people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why ?
because we all learned the stranger that strangers are dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have a problem , you get on things that are good . we could design . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Academy of Fine Arts , we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it &apos;s overall experience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we learned how to design items , but now we wanted to create immense confidence between people who had never met before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can design make such a thing ?
is it possible to create with design trust ?
I would like to give you a sample of what we trust .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your Com@@ for@@ tz@@ one .
thum@@ bs up if you are ready .
take your cell phone into your hand .
now I want to unlock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ locked mobile phone your left seat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this quiet approach of panic that will feel you -- -- is exactly what will hosts , when opening the first time the door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone , is your home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does it feel like holding a stranger &apos;s cell phone in his hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
so feel most guests when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
so who has now been Al Go@@ res &apos;s mobile phone ?
could you please visit us on Twitter that he is the President of the President ?
you can now reset the cell phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have now experienced what kind of trust we want , I want to tell you about some expl@@ or@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what if we had changed a little detail about this experiment ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what if your neighbor had imag@@ ined first of his name , if he would have told from whence he cometh , how his dog or his children be hot ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; imagine you have 150 beats , who all say : &quot; he can hold on really well @-@ locked cell@@ phones ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how would you feel like you would have to leave your mobile phone ?
for a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust .
in the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was difficult for those who give negative servants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest submitted their convic@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined , how probably it is that people trust in each other , depend on how much they are related to age and residence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
little unexpected we trust the people most who are most similar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a natural social pre@@ valence .
it will be exciting if you add a person &apos;s reputation - in our case by parti@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when one has less than three distri@@ butions , nothing changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but one has more than ten years to change .
a good reputation is common .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted pre@@ ferences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , we lear@@ nt that trust is dependent on how much you get . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if one tells too little about how &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you do not get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are too much about how to say , &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- is the request also not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is therefore an optimal degree of op@@ enness , for example &quot; Tol@@ le works in your apartment ! I &apos;m doing vacation with my family vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can I create it with design , produce this degree of op@@ enness ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we use the size of text , in order to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our whole company builds up the hope that the right design can help , to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ce towards strangers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we did not reck@@ on , the large amount of people who were more than ready to deposit these pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here you see how many people take our offer .
you can recognize three things .
firstly : incredibly good luck .
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a need that was not covered in advance .
the business is just going very good for us .
of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who have un@@ authorized parties and have been ra@@ v@@ aged .
hosts have allowed guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked on customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front lines when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it &apos;s hurt if I just think of it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ appointment , that was heard in the voice of att@@ ack@@ ers , was and will always be our biggest motivation to improve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
luck@@ ily there was only a fra@@ ction of the 123 million over@@ sized nights .
for people trust in one another .
when trust works , may be wonderful .
one of our guests made vacation in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host took him to the hospital .
he even sp@@ ends blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for trav@@ ellers seeking to tend to heart attack activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra is real guar@@ dian angels who save one lives even though they do not know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they drive one in your own car to the hospital , when one dies , and wait for one b@@ ypass . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they don &apos;t want you feel lon@@ ely , they set up books . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can even stay longer , without charge the extra nights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
this is of course not going on every stay .
but these relations behind the pure cash transaction are exactly what you want to reach with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled on this term I asked me :
how does the idea of sharing with cash transactions together ?
it is an economic trade here .
but it &apos;s just not just the &quot; rental industry &quot; to name it .
Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people are open a part of itself and that changes everything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you travel nowadays , it is easy to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what if traveling would be a rich buffet made from local impressions ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what if it would be visited every place where you visit , a group there would be waiting to fill a thoroughly and to show a tick over there , of which one has never heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
or if you could cook from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays flats after the principle of privacy are designed .
what if we would like to create apartments of the ground together ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would have the minds of shared ownership ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I place cities before , which allow us society and relationships , instead of sol@@ itude and de@@ fle@@ ction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul this project has already begun . lots of parking places that belonged to the government , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people were now offered to people who were looking for a stay in search of a stay .
have been medi@@ ated to humans whose children were gone out . In@@ cub@@ ator programmes were started .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone , night 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea seems to be not so crazy about how it was taught us .
we didn &apos;t inv@@ ent the wheel .
hospitality has been there before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why has just worked our works ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from happiness and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the existing products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted pre@@ judi@@ ces .
I find that b@@ los@@ som@@ ing ;
down@@ right amaz@@ ingly .
I must always think about it when a red Maz@@ da is passing over to me .
we know of course that design can not resolve any problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use for designing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a belie@@ ver ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ress that a brain under@@ ling@@ erie does a terrorist attack ?
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you the guilt for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people that look like me .
a study showed that 80 % of the reporting of Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show that the Americans think most would not know Muslims .
presumably the people don &apos;t speak with their u@@ ber @-@ drivers .
for all who have ever met a Muslim : it is great to meet you .
I say to you who I am .
I &apos;m a mother . I am a coffee maker - double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted .
one Mö@@ ll@@ s of Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ta@@ ics in
and I am a practic@@ ing spiritual firm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga , because , baby , I was not born so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I decided on this .
when I was 17 years old I met the decision to ou@@ gh@@ ten myself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , not as a hom@@ osex@@ ual man , as some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to carry the hi@@ j@@ ab my head covering . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why are you oppressed yourself ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the funny thing was : back then , it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , and the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old felt that I felt a perfect and un@@ reachable beauty ideal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I did with the Qur &apos;@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I read him , thought after , had dou@@ b@@ ted and believed ultimately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow dev@@ otion to deep@@ en himself with any reading of the Qur &apos;@@ an .
the beauty of the rhyth@@ mi@@ k sometimes leads me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did you ever feel that somebody wants to perc@@ ei@@ ves you , fully under@@ stands , and yet loving ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it feels like that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later I married and started , like all the good Egyptians , my career as a engineering . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later on , after my marriage , a child , and basically I lived in the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had my breakfast , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was smoke , air@@ planes flew into buildings , people j@@ ump@@ ed from buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical fault ?
my shock quickly changed into ou@@ trage .
why should I do such a thing ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; I changed the television channel and heard : &quot; ... Muslim terr@@ orists , ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ji@@ had , ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot;
Oh my God .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not only my country being attacked , but in the N@@ u turned me the deeds of others by a citizen in susp@@ ects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Middle West to the USA to start into a new city and begin studying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I remember how to wel@@ d -- as we wel@@ med -- so deeply it went to my seat , and I was the first time to be recognized as the Muslim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we moved to our apartment at this night , in a new city , in which it felt like a completely different world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then I saw and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations that said , &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Be careful not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed in the entire week inside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then it was Friday , that week -- the day that Muslims gather to prayer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and again the al@@ arms were waiting : &quot; not on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered , and I also heard of att@@ acking people on Muslims or from people who held for Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were really bran@@ dies on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something really felt right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because people who attacked this country , have attacked our country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have rejected the anger of people on the terr@@ orists .
imagine yourself ! I was angry too .
it is not easy to be able to explain in itself .
I have nothing against questions ; I love questions .
the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nowadays , we can really say people : &quot; there is a problem in this land -- it is called Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to close Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the United States .
only the question is : are we mal@@ icious or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ icious tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tum@@ our only stops under observation .
the alternatives are po@@ int@@ less because the question is false .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tum@@ our in the body of the United States , but a vital organ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , invent@@ ors and Olymp@@ ion@@ ic .
will the closure of mos@@ ques in America get safer ?
maybe it will stop a few parking spaces but stop stop terror .
regular visit to a mosque leads to people other faith toler@@ ant to show more ci@@ vic participation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as a leader of the police in the Washington , DC recently said : people are actually not capit@@ alized in mos@@ ques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are radi@@ zed in their cellar or in the bed in front of a computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the radic@@ alization process it has been noted that he can take the person from her church , even from her family , that the extre@@ mis@@ m must ab@@ h@@ or the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ or their behaviour and their ide@@ ology has fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we want to avoid radic@@ alization , we have to stop the people to go to mosque . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally a group like the IS is based their brut@@ ality with the Kor@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a mother , as a mother , I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we would add to the imagination , if one recogni@@ zes it as a representative of 1.6 billion believers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups asser@@ t their ide@@ ology and their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you throw a look at her , she does not matter what they read in her &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality which they can read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding i@@ Ima@@ m I recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she had prepared to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she was in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that the problem was exactly the opposite . every priest , with whom she spoke , brought her to silence , and told her that their sense of iniquity in the world would only bring them into trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from nothing inspired and something that would have given their anger , it was a prime goal for the instrument@@ alization through extre@@ mi@@ sts that have promised a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Ima@@ m introduced the connection to God and its church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of using them for their rage , he showed their constructive way for a true change in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what she learned in the mosque she kept it to join the IS .
it was an insight how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia has concerned me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect every other ?
how does the 24 hour consumption of fear affects our democracy every day ?
a study -- actually various neuro@@ science studies -- show : when we fear we will pass at least three things .
we rather accept an author@@ itarian government system , conformity and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one study shows : if one reports test@@ es news in which neg@@ atively reported about Muslims , they voted by military attacks against Muslim countries and the circumcision of American Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not just a academic problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look when the mood against Muslims upwards -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happened in advance of the Iraq war and during two election periods .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror , as I expected it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public , in order to raise the foundation of a free society that has sensible and well informed citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear alle@@ ys us all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the assignment of collective inno@@ c@@ ence , it is not only about to explain themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple , which lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina where both went to school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
De@@ ah was a ath@@ lete .
he was talented to the dental faculty , talented and highly promising ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his sister would say to me that he was the sweet , most generous man , whom she knew . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her CV ; she was amaz@@ ed and said :
&quot; when did I become a sealed young man from my breasts ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne at her brother and his wife , she was murdered , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , who was murdered in the afternoon while he post@@ pon@@ ed against Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he enjoyed eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ sm can not only be imm@@ oral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
went we to the mosque or did we stay safe at home ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see it and for us it was not a slight decision , because we want to leave America to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we op@@ ted for the mosque .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with our son in the child &apos;s seat we went silent , with high pressure to the mosque . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I took him out , my shoes went out , and went into the hall of prayer ; and what I saw I had stopped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement and welcomed our guests , for half of the children were gathered , Christians , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , ath@@ ei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who were come to attack us but to join us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in that moment I have collap@@ sed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these people were there , because they had courage and compassion on pre@@ judi@@ ce and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what will you choose ?
what are you to choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be sure to go back ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or will you join them , which mean : we are better than those . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you very much .
thanks beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia - you seem to have taken a nervous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I ask myself why you say that you say that you are a T@@ ED@@ Talk , a thought of depth in a clas@@ sy monument , which is an exception and not the rule . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say that you don &apos;t dec@@ eive yourself . I am completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when one looks at the Muslims in the whole world , and I did the largest ever conducted studies on Muslims in the whole world , they want to normal things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they want prosperity for the family they want to work and they want to live in peace .
so I &apos;m in no way an exception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when people appear as an exception to rule , then usually the rule is broken , and they are not the exception to rule . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
HW : many thanks . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what began as a platform for Bast@@ ers , is about to be a multi @-@ dollar store . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before air @-@ coll@@ ision occurs in our social consciousness that has built an autonomous fleet of flight machines at the F@@ RAC Centre in France live a six @-@ metre high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago they began to fly with ropes .
by connecting you can achieve high speed and acceleration in the confin@@ ed space .
you can also build up durable structures .
they have learned to take loads to deal with turbul@@ ence and generally react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to exceed the limits of the possible in the autonomous flight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with it works autonom@@ ously , it needs to know collec@@ tively where the mobile objects are located in the space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . that enables us to focus on rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for today &apos;s demos we use a new loc@@ alization technology by Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in space , calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
external commands are available on the highest layer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear @-@ starter engine ;
a flying unit tried to beat two flies with a fla@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in the forward flight , much more efficient than Hel@@ icop@@ ter in all its variations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to most powerful r@@ hi@@ gli@@ ders it can float , and has great benefits with start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there is always a revers@@ al page .
a limitation of hed@@ star@@ ters is that they respond sensitive to turbul@@ ence such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is , that the flight equipment does not care in which position can be improved and improved by practi@@ sing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during our research , we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions which can advance to the core of the cause . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one such question would be for example : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for this to respond to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known about as machines with a thousand moving parts who send themselves to viol@@ ate you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before decades , pilots managed to fly remot@@ ely controlled air devices that had only two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a tail@@ gate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we discovered that flies with just one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically sim@@ pl@@ est remote @-@ controlled flight unit . it was invented in front of a short fiction .
it has only a moving part , a prop@@ eller .
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse areas - no further pro@@ pul@@ sion or control surfaces . only a prop@@ eller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is simple , it happens in the inner life so much that it can fly stable and move up in space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tail@@ gate . to get it to fly , I have to throw it accurately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood , to throw it accurately , if all watch is low , I show you a video that was filmed last night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the mon@@ osp@@ els is an exercise in gen@@ om@@ el@@ ty , this machine is here , the omni@@ bus with its eight Prop@@ ellers , an exercise in over@@ flow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what to do with all this over@@ flow ?
they see that they have been symmet@@ ric .
therefore it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
he receives the great skill in this way ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in space to move in all directions , no matter what direction he is rot@@ ated or even how he rot@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of eight Prop@@ ellers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some can be displayed in models and the rest is learned directly when flying .
let us see that .
when flight machines should be part of our everyday life they must be extremely secure and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate bi@@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
this turns clo@@ ck@@ wise
and the other against clo@@ ck@@ wise .
if you build them together they be@@ have like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ scope .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , anything goes wrong -- an engine or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine as well as limited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will demonstrate that by being flying a half .
the last demonstration uses synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allow a wide selection of aesthetic expression .
we took standard micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p it with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . that &apos;s why there is no upper limit .
hopefully motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to reflect new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine there wants to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for types such as us lies the reward in the development and the production process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that there are creative , smart ways to form it in so spectacular way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that this technology has such massive and economic potential , the dot is on the i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before 1.3 billion years ago , there are two black holes in a very far distant galaxy , and faster , they walked in pure energy in a tenth century . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this short moment , she laugh@@ ed brigh@@ ter than all the stars in all galax@@ ies of the entire universe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a very great b@@ ang .
but they don &apos;t put their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire energy was given to the space time frame itself , and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we arrange the events in time .
1.3 billion years ago there was just multi@@ cell life arose on earth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then the Earth has shown a lot : cor@@ als , fishes , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , men and -- God is standing at -- even the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about 25 years ago a group decided to build a mut@@ ati@@ ous -- R@@ ai Weiss from MIT &apos;s MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver of C@@ alt@@ ech -- a huge laser det@@ ector to emer@@ ge in some black holes .
most held them crazy for crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy gen@@ ies so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely much harder work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ ry sky Ob@@ servatory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the following time the precision of Lig@@ o could significantly increase the level of recognition is enormous .
therefore one calls it Advanced Lig@@ o now .
at the beginning of September 2015 Lig@@ o was started for a last test run to clari@@ fy some minor problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the vit@@ ational waves ro@@ uted by the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes through the earth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : just two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the farewell of my death sick father .
basically it was the fruits of my life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this , what I had worked is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist like Lig@@ o meas@@ ur@@ able signals . what are the waves of gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a stream of gra@@ vit@@ ation is in the structure of space and time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during passing the shaft , space and its entire content is stretched in one direction and to the other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to illustr@@ ate the faculty of faculty in courses for the theory of rela@@ tivity is often quite ambitious dance .
&quot; stret@@ chy and du@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 14 September , for example , each one was stretched and gest@@ ed by us during the opening of the waves . the stretching of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is called 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by 1 . thus one stated the Lig@@ o staff for crazy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a five kilometer long laser detector , and that is absurd , it would have to be precisely measured for less than a thousand times the radius of a nuclear waste . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of his classical text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
described in Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are enormous .
but physi@@ cists are final and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles . &quot;
Thor@@ ne released this in 1973 ; 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott claimed that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; visible light has a wave length , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is quite practical . for example , you can customize a picture or map of things by telling you that from several points about coming around you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for killing this is different .
audible tones have a wave length of up to 15 meters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that are particularly good : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to the face of your child approximately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , we listen to certain characteristics like sound and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now just speaks Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; dum@@ bs Bob &quot; .
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we can do with them no simple images of objects in space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but by watching changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least Lig@@ o is the measured frequencies in the audible range .
if we convert wave pattern in sound patterns we can literally speak of all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gra@@ vit@@ ation of gravity can tell us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has already been busy very long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
S@@ H : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , circul@@ ate : w@@ up@@ p !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turning the two body very fast , you can hear the same cir@@ cus with an additional note of keys . that sounds like : W@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a type of movement of movement that embos@@ ses in the wav@@ e@@ form form .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I must never forget -- what he has to hear , recognise this as a sound of -- S@@ H : ... two black holes , each turning around as quickly as the rods of your mixer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AA : let &apos;s think about what this means .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two black holes , the most dense body in space , one with a mass of 29 prob@@ es , the other with a mass of 36 son@@ es , orbit a hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know that because we have heard it .
this is the permanent meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o is p@@ aving a completely new way to study the universe as it was never before possible .
on this way we can listen to the universe and the invisible .
much in space we can -- practically or basically -- not seen .
a super@@ nov@@ a for example . I would like to know why m@@ water ponds are explo@@ de in super@@ nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . we &apos;ve learned many of them at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exciting physical processes occur but in the nucle@@ us , which is hidden behind thousands of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will never see through since these op@@ aque are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rate iron , as would it be transparent glass . the urine is like to explore the first few minutes of the universe , but we will never see it , because the urine is covered by his own after@@ glow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by means of gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to withdraw from the very beginning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the most important thing : I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen , which we will never see and of which we have no idea . things that we can only discover by hearing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , Lig@@ o found the first run of things that we did not expect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my colleague at the MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says to this topic : &quot; ME : the type of stars , such as Lig@@ o her , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are huge , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are so to speak na@@ eb@@ ri@@ gs for our ar@@ cheological work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lig@@ o enables us to view a completely different view of the events in space , in the creation of the stars and ultimately , as we walked out of this may@@ hem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AA : the challenge is to be as cour@@ age@@ ously as only possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the h@@ iss of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new ob@@ servatory -- a brand new generation of ob@@ servatory on Earth and all .
for what could be better than to listen to the Ur@@ b@@ ang ?
now the time is great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried out an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for one year I would say &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if it made me nervous , I made myself in unpleasant situations , I like to say &quot; Yes &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no but yes !
did I want to be on TV live ?
no but yes !
would I start to play with the scene ?
no , no , but yes , yes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a mad thing happened , that thing happened to do before I was afraid , removed my fear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my fear , speech@@ es , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; my life changed .
&quot; yes &quot; I changed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was a certain yea , this changed my life to an un@@ expect@@ edly name . it all began with a question of my youngest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three unbelievable daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls from un@@ explained reasons to all &quot; Evalu@@ ator , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she would be a wa@@ it@@ ress from the South .
&quot; swe@@ eth@@ ear@@ ts I need milk for my cup of cable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wonder@@ ed if I was playing with her , when I was just on the jump . and I said , &quot; yeah . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was the beginning
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new life of life in my family . from then on , I s@@ wore to play with them once you do . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or wherever I go , I say always Yes -- every single time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost . I &apos;m not perfect but I am very tired .
it has a magical effect on me to keep my children on our family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently , I understood the &quot; Yes &quot; -@@ s@@ ages to play with my children saved my career . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am the author . I think of things j@@ aw@@ aken you to live .
dream job .
no .
I am a titanium .
dream job .
I create TV . I do production TV .
I &apos;m doing TV in big style .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for some 70 hours of program in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each stream provides hundreds of jobs that had not existed before .
the budget for a television channel may be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new episode of all nine days even four shows , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three programmes which simultaneously in production are four episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of television , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series hur@@ ls at each other on Thursday night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I have created myself and not only produced , creative time to gather my fans about camp@@ fires and tell my stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four TV shows , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fires that burn around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you know who else does it ?
no one . that &apos;s why I am a titanium .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say to you , that all of you are working so hard , whether you go a company or a class@@ room , a shop or a class@@ room , so that I say that I am not just walking around on the computer , and I understand , that it &apos;s wrong with dream job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , everything sweat -- no tears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I work a lot too hard and I love it .
when I am deep@@ ened in the work there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is , when I put troops in , when I painted on a canvas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so as dre@@ aming a high sound , I delivered a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ yon@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is creative , mechan@@ ically , exhau@@ sting and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , clin@@ ically and maternal , cruel and sensible . and the best thing about it is sum@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is so a change in me when the work goes well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a sum@@ s begin in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sum@@ s sounds like a busy road , I could go for ever . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people take this , if I declare the sum@@ s that I speak to them that writing is ready for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
don &apos;t get me wrong about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the sum@@ s -- when I began to work and work , building up , create , create , create , create and cooperate , I discovered this sum@@ s , this energy . the tot@@ als ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tot@@ als is more than writing .
the tot@@ als is action and activity . the tot@@ als is a drug .
the tot@@ als is music . the tot@@ als is light and air .
the sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you have such a sum@@ s , then you can &apos;t stri@@ ve differently to your size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the feeling that cannot be different than asp@@ ire to size , no matter what price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is what you call the sum@@ s .
or maybe it means to be a work@@ ah@@ olic .
maybe it &apos;s called gen@@ ius .
maybe it is ego .
maybe it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only know that I &apos;m not for the failure of my life , and I know only that I love the tot@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will only say to you , I am a titanium , and I know that I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to make one clear : the more successful I am , the more episodes , the more on the more episodes , the more work there are , the more things I write , the more I write history , the more expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
I love work not true ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the land I create the marathon , the marathon , which I run , the army , the high clay , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the tot@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I like this sum@@ s . I love the tot@@ als .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the tot@@ als .
am I only this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
revised , over@@ loaded , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated .
the sum@@ s stopped .
now my three daughters are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the truth that their m@@ um is a single working institution .
Har@@ per tells us : &quot; my m@@ um will not be there but you can write to my m@@ anny . &quot;
and Emer@@ son tells us : &quot; saved &quot; I &apos;d like to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot;
these are the children of a titanium .
you are Baby @-@ Titan@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the tot@@ als stopped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sum@@ s of the engine stopped .
I didn &apos;t loved my job anymore . the engine was off .
the sum@@ s did not come back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I made the same things as usual : the same Titan@@ s work , 15 hours @-@ day , well @-@ performed weekends , no regret not does not give up with all your heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me was silence .
four TV programs ; 70 hours , three productions at the same time .
four TV programs - 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a preview of Titan Poker ;
everything was grey ; I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
all that I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the tot@@ als I was .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so what do you do when doing what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ aded ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I know that some may think : &quot; Gras@@ l yourself out of &quot; the author @-@ Titan . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but you know what you do is working , you have to be a teacher , a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a master when you know the sum@@ s when you stop the sum@@ s when the tot@@ als stops , who is then ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what are you ?
what am I like ?
am I still a titanium ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the song of my heart li@@ stens , I cannot survive in silence ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then my &quot; southern states &quot; wa@@ it@@ ress gave me a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way out to the outside , too late and she says : &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot;
and I want to say no more than two things are aware of this :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , I have to say Yes to all , and secon@@ dly , she named me no &quot; Evalu@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it calls me no more &quot; swe@@ eth@@ ear@@ ts . &quot;
when did it happen ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I missed it when I &apos;m Titan and my tot@@ als , and here everything changes in my own eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so she says : &quot; Mama &quot; do you like to play ? &quot;
and I say : &quot; yeah . &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we play and her sisters push to it , we laugh a lot and I &apos;m very dramatic from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing unusual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in sol@@ itude and lack of money , I can &apos;t do anything except to fit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am focused .
I am quiet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the land , which I create the marathon , the marathon , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they don &apos;t exist any more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all that exists are sti@@ cky finger and mo@@ ist kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax stal@@ ks and the song , where it is lost , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Fro@@ zen Queen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
everywhere there is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me solves .
a mental door goes up and an energy boost arrives at .
and that doesn &apos;t happen immediately but it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s come back slowly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no full volume , barely there , it is silent , hardly audible , but it is there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not the sum@@ s but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel like I would know a magical mystery .
but let us remain with the cause .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . just love .
it is something we forgot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sum@@ s , the labour sum@@ s , the titanium dioxide , that is only the replacement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I ask you who are you , if I am saying to you who I am I describe how my brain is , then I forgot to what the real sum@@ s are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sum@@ s is no power and it is not working specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real sum@@ s depends on love .
the sum@@ s is the river that comes from the lust of life .
the real hum@@ ming is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real sum@@ s igno@@ res the pressure of the story , which are the results of dis@@ claim@@ ing tasks , anticip@@ ation and pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real hum@@ ming is simple and original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps he whis@@ pered all the wrong words , because what God said to me that I am a titanium ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it just is just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me I will say yes .
I make this a firm rule so that I can free myself from any guilt as a work@@ ah@@ olic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice , if I want to listen to the sum@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in games I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not enough to me how to work .
the truth does hurt .
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work as I love it .
I prefer my workplace as at home .
this con@@ fes@@ sion is painful for a person rather than to be a home ?
well yes I am .
time to be honest I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ra@@ ded around in the garden , and back and forth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we Make small Dance Parties ;
we sing and play ball .
we pu@@ ffed with bubbles .
I feel predominantly sti@@ ff , ab@@ sent and confused .
I always use my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my children show me how to live , and the sum@@ s of the universe full of me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why did we ever listen to games ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also say it ! say , Yes , if your child wants to play with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe you hold me for na@@ i@@ v , for a day dre@@ amer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there you have right , but you can do it too ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting when you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they think of something else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are wonderful 15 minutes but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bug or bis@@ cuit is replaced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he speaks to me for about 15 minutes , and I &apos;m mother of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are only 15 minutes more need to do more .
everybody can bring 15 minutes to the piece by yourself on a bad mood !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile phone , no washing . no depos@@ itor .
the day is short : dinner prepared by children .
but 15 minutes are inside !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my children are my welfare , my world . it must not be the children . it is to feel the sum@@ s to have a place for his peace of mind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy .
about the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
treat yourself to 15 minutes !
find out what you do good .
find it out and keep it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I be able . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; just for everything I &apos;ve given up when I got my first TV show when I was a titanium in training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes a piece why not allow for full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my spare time . the sum@@ s seems to return when I didn &apos;t work .
working works not working without games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it takes time , but after a few months I will open a door and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown tune . I hear it again . I use it in full trains and I love my work again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like the sum@@ s , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the sum@@ s that sum@@ s is not me ... nothing more .
bubble and sti@@ cky finger and dinner with friends .
that is my sum@@ s .
the tot@@ als of life .
the tot@@ als of love .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sum@@ s of labour is part of me , but just a part . and therefore I am so grateful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s snow@@ ing that I &apos;m a titanium . I &apos;ve never seen a titanium , the trip to Jerusalem is playing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I said yes to less work and to more play .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my inventory is still burning .
the more I play I am the happ@@ ier I and my children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I play , the more I feel like a good mother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I play , the clear@@ er is my head . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the more I play I work the better I work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I play , the more I hear the tot@@ als . the land that I kill the marathon , the pieces , the screens , the high clay , the sum@@ s , the real sum@@ s : the sum@@ s of life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I feel this sum@@ p , the more it makes this unusual , un@@ ning , naked and new feeling of life within me wide . less Titan -- More me ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I feel exactly this Sum@@ i , the more I know who I am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am the author . I think of things that I &apos;m considering to live .
this belongs to the job that means to live his dream .
that is the dream of this job .
because a dream job should be a bit dre@@ am@@ ful .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to work and to play more .
Titan@@ s don &apos;t have a chance here .
what do you want to play ? &quot;
thanks beautiful .
I am Neuro@@ surgical .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a stroke or a car accident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the brain is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following a severe violation of central nervous system , people often have a lasting , severe disability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is probably the reason why I was functional Neuro@@ surgical .
what is a functional Neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who is trying to improve the nerve function through various surgical measures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certainly they have heard of one of the most famous organs of the deep enh@@ ir@@ n@@ stimulation . &quot; here you im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain , in order to influence the circuits of the neur@@ ons so that the neurolog@@ ical function has improved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really an amazing technology . it has been improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease , the most severe fry and severe pain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation however does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional Neuro@@ ch@@ ir@@ ur@@ ges is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with some help , the brain can help itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the history began 15 years ago .
at that time I was a guiding specialist and worked day and night in the emergency .
I often provided patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
they have to imagine that in the brain trau@@ ma @-@ trau@@ mat@@ a bra@@ s@@ ated the brain and increases the c@@ ran@@ ate pressure .
to save lives you have to reduce the skull pressure .
for that you sometimes have to remove a s@@ wollen brain compound .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of throwing the s@@ wollen brain compound , we decided to analyze ourselves with Jean François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist on brain compound . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what do I mean ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is no light task .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cells of a tissue grow to grow , comparable to all small children , who will be taken out of your families . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to find proper nutrition , temperature , humidity , and environments to flour@@ ish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is precisely what we had to do with these cells .
after many experiments it was done by Jean François .
that was what he saw under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it looked just like a regular cell culture . with large green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps you are still aware of the biology , that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can transform into each cell type of the organism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is surprising , this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain in surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die ; they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they split slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , we saw a new , strange cell population which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we needed for a long time to understand whence they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells hot Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
you make 4 % of our cer@@ eb@@ ell@@ ar sh@@ ell@@ ency .
you play a very important role in our development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the stage of the fet@@ us , they are responsible for the development of the brain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but why do they remain ?
we do not know that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in taking part in the healing of the brain , since we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not so sure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing however is clear -- of these cells , we received our stem cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stand before a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to extract a brain of brain from the non @-@ language area and then cultiv@@ ate cells , as it did Jean François Hollande . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and afterwards they may highlight color in order to follow them in the brain .
in the past step we celebrated it at the rap@@ ture of the same individual .
we call aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ tation -- aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ t .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we do these cells in normal ne@@ ural tissue ? and what will happen if we don &apos;t want the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with monkeys .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first scenario we did not show the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed it completely disappeared again when they were taken back . the room is already busy , so they will not disappear , so they disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the second scenario , we added a violation of and was anno@@ ying exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here you see what we were able to watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been seem@@ ingly designed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the evidence that they show , are these small points . these are the cells that we dis@@ colored in vitro , in the culture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here we were not able to stop .
help these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual skill task .
they had to take food p@@ ellets of one tablet .
they made them very well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they reached a stable skill level , we injured the motor motor skills in the motor al@@ ak@@ ex . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just how it would happen with people , they recovered spont@@ ane@@ ously until a certain degree , just like a stroke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover Lyme brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just like the monkeys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ pl@@ anti@@ ed his own cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the left you see the monkeys that re@@ covering spont@@ ane@@ ously .
it can yield about 40 % to 50 % of its original power from injury .
it is not as precise and not so fast .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , when we could see the cells as usual : the same atri@@ cian , two months after friction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can tell you that were very exciting for us as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this time , we have found very much more about these cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we can freeze it and use it later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease models .
but our dream is still to im@@ plant them with people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyway , I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know somebody who can need . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I definitely stay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the question of what are the biggest obstacles before being able to begin clinical trials on humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the greatest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results , one has to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : this is logical , the brain is very del@@ ik@@ at etc .
J@@ B : yes but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a nearly professional team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BG : take a look into the future -- you have completed research , and tried to take a look at the start of clinical trials . if you continue to come into the future , how many years it will take until someone can come into the hospital , and this treatment will be available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ B : it &apos;s hard to say .
it initially depends on the approval of clinical study .
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it needs a long time to choose the patient , perform the treatment and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then you have to apply this to a multic@@ enter study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , you have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : and that it is safe . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne . thank you for visiting T@@ ED and that you have told us about it .
BG : many thanks .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake as a matter of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see democracy not as the frag@@ ile plant which is in reality , but as inventory of our society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we tend to consider them as an un@@ changing texture .
we believe capitalism leads inev@@ it@@ ably to democracy .
that is not true .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew out of Singapore and its great after@@ mat@@ h have proved that it is possible to have a flowering capitalism and impressive growth , while the politics remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
actually the democracy over@@ comes with us in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I rep@@ ented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was im@@ min@@ able to me as a finance minister of our country -- our choices -- not the austerity programs which could influence the austerity programs which have been realised in Greece .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that moment , I thought that there could be no better jus@@ tification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , which would be repeated to me if it would change anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask you to believe in cooperation with me , that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the euro@@ gruppe will save us , but that we need a true and def@@ ensive democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for without democracy , our societies are w@@ asted , our future glo@@ omy and our great , new technologies w@@ asted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to show you an interesting contra@@ diction that is currently our ta@@ vern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I call it the &quot; twin @-@ top par@@ adox . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one summit is known to you . they know and recognize him as the debt of the school , which raises its long shadow over the US , Europe and the whole world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all recognise the debt @-@ mountain ;
but only few are recognis@@ able his twin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a hill of un@@ t@@ apped cash , which is heard however too fear@@ ful to invest in , where there could be productive and income that could produce the debt that mankind is urg@@ ently needed , for example , &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past 3 months in the U.S. , in England and in the euro zone , 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars have been invested , such as industrial buildings , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks and so forth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3.4 trillion U.S. dollar sounds according to much money , until they were ro@@ amed around the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing except the ex@@ changes to blow up the real estate prices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; debt and un@@ productive capital make the twin peaks , which are not equal to the usual market mechanisms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is stronger wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ old people unemployed , and consequently a low economic demand that would kill the pes@@ si@@ mis@@ m that his son would kill him when he will grow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
un@@ inten@@ tionally the circumstances make that they kills him .
it is my hair with capitalism --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its most severe Art. All the un@@ productive capital should be used to further enhance our lives , improving human talents , and especially to finance its technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arist@@ ot@@ le defines democracy as the corporate form , in which the open and the poor control the government as a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy included too many --
women , foreigners ; and of course slaves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it would be a mistake , to reduce the job value of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decisive thing in the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that she gave them the working poor , but not only the right to freedom of expression , but import@@ antly , the right to political participation with same tuning weigh@@ ting in matters of state debt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not long been held --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a candle , which g@@ lows very bright , it is also fast burned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however our today liberal democra@@ cies have not established their roots in ancient Athens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on free citizens , the liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na C@@ arta , ultimately a stat@@ ute for powers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the liberal democracy arrived only when a full separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was declared to politics , while the economy -- thus the world of corpor@@ ations -- a democra@@ ti@@ y zone was created . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our current democra@@ cies since that time , when the separation from politics and economy began , an in@@ ex@@ orable fight between the two and the economy gradually mig@@ rates to politics and dis@@ ma@@ stered it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you wonder why the politicians do not like more like that ?
it is not part of a de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is because you can be in the government today and still not in power , because the power of politics is w@@ ander@@ ed into the economy and the areas are separated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you think about it , it &apos;s in about like a flock of rob@@ ber@@ y , which makes them nour@@ ished , dec@@ im@@ ated that they are star@@ ved at the end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar is it with the economy that involves the politics so far can@@ ni@@ b@@ alized , the power of the corpor@@ ations grows , the ine@@ quality is rising and the managing director of the corpor@@ ations are to be sc@@ ary to invest the cash of their companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more the more successful capitalism of the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; markets out of democracy , the higher the tw@@ ins , and the greater the waste of human labor power and the prosperity of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that is true , it is obvious that we have to put the politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; control , aside from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Marxist Lin@@ ke had this idea for 100 years ago , and it was not very strange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union , the working poor should only gain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there is a solution : creating the working arms !
capitalism is doing it by replacing low wages due to automation and rob@@ otic system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem is that such a long economy and politics are separate areas , the automation can become higher than the w@@ ast@@ age , and the social conflicts , as it is -- already very soon as I think - will come in countries like China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to re@@ un@@ ite the economy and re@@ un@@ ite the areas of economy and politics , and we are sure to democra@@ ti@@ ze the recovery of hyper@@ auto@@ cla@@ ws that will show the film &quot; Matrix &quot; as a documentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question is not , whether capitalism is the technical achievements which he has brought forth will survive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a D@@ yst@@ opia , similar to the human being in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; or through a high @-@ tech version of ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long convers@@ ations to the sense of life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think we may be optimistic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so what would it like , what could it look like these &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; rather Utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ similar D@@ yst@@ opia ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the field of business : please imagine a capital market which you deser@@ ve money while you are working and in which your capital works from a company to the next , and the company -- is property of them that are currently working in the company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , all income from capital and rede@@ em@@ ing and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no distinction between them that belong to companies but not work therein , and employees work there , but no exchange between Capital and Work , no big g@@ aps between investment and dro@@ ves , and ultimately no empirical tw@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of global political economy : please introduce in short notice that our national currencies have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G20 &apos;s in the interests of all mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make sure that the whole world trade is negoti@@ ated in this currency -- call it &quot; the cos@@ mos &quot; , into units of &quot; cos@@ mos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum of the trade deficit or the surplus of the country into a common fund . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that this fund is being invested in green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world , in which investment means are ra@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at the time there was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , we have them , in particular in the background of a re@@ unified policy and business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world that I describe to you is con@@ voy , in which they pre@@ fers privileged persons , and Marxist , because they are buried in the separation of capital and work in the tra@@ sh bin of history , and key@@ n@@ esi@@ anic , global key@@ n@@ esi@@ anic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we wake up in such a world
or are we going to drop in a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar D@@ yst@@ opia ?
the answer depends on how we decide politically .
it is in our hands and we can do it better .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography itself as Liber@@ t@@ ar Mar@@ xi@@ sten .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the re@@ unification of politics and economics , we do not do that , technological development will produce such a massive decline in total economic demand that Larry sum@@ mers as &quot; long @-@ term st@@ agnation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the transfer of this crisis of a part of Earth to the next , as we experience it now , it will not only be our democra@@ cies but also the countries whose interest is low in liberal democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this analysis is true , Marx is absolutely relevant ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Hay@@ ek &apos;s , as well as Hay@@ ek , I am a liberal Marxist , and therefore I &apos;m in@@ hospitable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : actually , and now we are happy too .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t bu@@ r ... you don &apos;t think enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BG : it is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said it . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the Red@@ ner , you have very clear what you think of the view of the West to China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democra@@ cies we have the appearance of a democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I said in my presentation , we have limited democracy on politics , while the area where it plays most , -- the area of business -- a completely democratic @-@ democratic zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some ways , if I may say the pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today re@@ sembles the England of the 19th century . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because -- remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism by democracy -- this is a mistake , historical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als - how John Stuart Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical at what concerns the democratic development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what can be observed in China today , re@@ sembles the development which we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China now is to act to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ ells of hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : I &apos;m sure that many listen@@ ers are curious about your experiences as a finance minister of Greece in the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I thought that it comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal point of view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting , because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the Eurozone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not only Greece but the Eurozone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; namely , our self @-@ suffici@@ ency has to say that a massive tre@@ ad route passed through the euro zone , and continues to massi@@ vely increase the development of the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had the opportunity on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal was that revealed this den@@ ying -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately it is true . unfortunately , the powers inside the euro zone , within the European Group , continued to deny the den@@ ying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when one tries to receive a economic system that is not vi@@ able to receive by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ an@@ ism , it will be possible to pass any time when the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and de@@ structive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : what change you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro zone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : do you have any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- gravity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is a finance minister , or any minister , that claims after 6 months in office , especially in such a cl@@ amped situation , said that he did not make any mistake , then it is a dangerous person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the greatest mistake was to sign up the filing of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an hon@@ our@@ able interest on the pages of the don@@ ors to find a common solution .
but that didn &apos;t exist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they merely wanted to do our government , just because they did not want to deal with au@@ ditions who ran through the euro area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they carried out a disast@@ rous program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nom@@ al GDP .
it is worse than during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; none of the Tro@@ ika of the don@@ ors who imposed this policy has raised us , &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ cel@@ ess mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all that and despite the aggressive T@@ ons of talks you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my critic@@ isms of the European Union and the Eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my greatest fear is that the Eurozone would not survive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if they have not survived , the ruling leaders will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we strike ourselves to hit the way of a post@@ modern 1930 , what it seems to me , it will be unbe@@ ar@@ able for the future of Europeans , as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong with that point .
Yan@@ is , thank you so much you were with T@@ ED .
Y@@ V : thanks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Roy Price you &apos;ve never heard most , although he probably is responsible for 22 @-@ moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for too many of you .
it &apos;s going back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is a leader at Amazon Studios
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a spin@@ ach and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technique , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roy has a very important job , because he is responsible for making the shows and content to produce the Amazon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV shows that Roy cannot choose any of these .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in other words , he has to find shows that are located right on this curve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the website IM@@ DB , which shows the rating from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are given . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will your show be valued at nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are shows like &quot; Breaking Bad , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive where you ask a season , your brain asks : &quot; where is there more of these episodes ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the left , here at this end , shows are shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ ler and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- which should say enough to you at this end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roy Price does not get to get on the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to under@@ line &quot; To@@ dd@@ ler and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he makes more thoughts on the middle cutter , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply inspire them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so he must make sure that he really is on the right side .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something that makes Roy Price nothing to risk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants to create successes .
he needs a guaranteed success . so he will hold a competition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses eight candidates for TV shows , then he produced the first episode of each of these shows and makes them online where everybody can watch for free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if Amazon has nothing to go out for free it is going to be correct ?
millions of viewers look at these episodes .
but they do not know that they are watching during viewing this shows .
you will be watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you capture when you start the show , when you p@@ auses , which parts you jumps or watches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they collect millions of data to decide with this data , which show they should produce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect data , process this and resulting from it and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four rep@@ ubli@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many remember this show because it was not so good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 -- so something on average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the same time at another company , another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , who is always searching for a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it something different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of organis@@ ing a contest , he and his team watched the existing data via the Net@@ fli@@ x viewer , so the reviews they show the shows where shows they like etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then use this data to find these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they had gathered all the parts , they went a venture and decided not to make a Sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit with it , at least for the first two seasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,1 response on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course the question is : what has happened here ?
two very competitive , data consumed companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they connect these many data and it works super for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is that ?
because logic prec@@ edes the fact that it should work with everything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you accumul@@ ate millions of dates , for a decision which one meets , you should make a good decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
you optim@@ ise it through very efficient computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Min@@ de@@ ste , what can be expected is good TV , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when data analysis is not working , then this is a bit sc@@ ary , because we live in a time in which we take more and more to take more serious decisions to make serious decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does anyone here know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
nobody . OK . that &apos;s good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multi @-@ health system is a software company and I hope that no one comes into contact with this software ever . come in contact , you are in prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if anyone here is in prison and ask for release , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is to determine whether a dis@@ mis@@ sal is made or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just like with Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad , will be decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; medi@@ oc@@ re TV , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but more years in prison are worse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that these data analysis , despite the many data , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not always creates the best results . that &apos;s not always the fact that a company , such as multi @-@ health system , does not know how to use data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the data will also be w@@ ron@@ g@@ ly wrong .
yes . even Google makes mistakes sometimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2009 , Google announced that they can predi@@ ct data analysis out@@ breaks from flu , the bad way -- through data analysis of Google &apos;s research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it worked mira@@ cul@@ ously and was a great message here . success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it worked fine , year around year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and nobody could say why .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply did not work , that was again a sensation , including the release of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the data have experienced users such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite all these errors , data will close in the decisions of life -- in the work of law en@@ forcement , in medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data are helpful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area where some very smart people use un@@ imagin@@ ably many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the years , I recognized a few patterns through the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you need to solve a complex problem if you mainly do two things :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , put this problem into its parts , so that you can analyse the individual parts ; as a second one put the items together to summar@@ ize a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : taking apart and put together again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and now the important facts : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to disman@@ tle the problem and understand it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not suitable for putting parts again , and then come to a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is another tool for this and we all have it : our brain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is something that the brain is good , there are parts and pieces again to summar@@ ize , even if the information is incomplete , especially when the brain is an expert . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have used data and understanding where they belong in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they use data to better understand their audience , what they wouldn &apos;t have been able to put all these parts again and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; and it does not stand in the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show what meant it meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they used data to control all their choices , first as they selected about TV @-@ ideas , then selected as the &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a safe decision because they could say always : &quot; they tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data is useful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool and in order not to forget it , this device is quite useful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of you will be ...
before there was data I was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . it is amazing . for decisions with a J@@ a- or no question , you only need to sh@@ aking the ball to get an answer . &quot; highly likely &quot; -- right here at that moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will fin@@ ite it later with a technology demo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have taken some decisions in my life , and I should have heard on the ball . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , as you naturally know if you have the data available , you would like to replace them by anything like data analysis to make better decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this does not change the fundamental muscle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the ball is smar@@ ter and wis@@ er and kl@@ ur@@ ger . finally , it lies in us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I felt this as being very encouraging message that , in spite of the great amount of data , it pays off to make decisions to be an expert in what you do , and risks to go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because at the end , there are not the data , but the risks associated with which you end up at the right end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks beautiful .
