<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They perhaps know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New-York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "long before someone had heard by Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book, in which he published spectacular telephones of Americans." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "but there is another chapter, that should leave a permanent impression." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "in this, he describes a disastrous US secret operation, in which the CIA was literally handed over to Iran for an atomic bomb." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy you can read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But you don't know whom the chapter didn't like?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "for almost 10 years, the government against Risen has determined and asked him to call his alleged springs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "in this train, he became a symbol of the patterns of the government, Whistleblowers and warmed journalists." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "according to the First Constitutional atz, the media have the right to publish secret information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the mugs they give identity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "so when the government was knocked, he did something that many brave reporters did before him: he refused, and said that he would prefer to go into prison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to enter prison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "but then, just days before the process, something extraordinary happens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "suddenly, though they were for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of government forces were dropped." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic surveillance the Reporter and Sources are hiding less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "instead of failing and fouting to the statements, this could also carry out its digital footprints for him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "and so the investigators, without his agreement, had worshiped his phone secretly," "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "just like its e-mail data, financial and banking information, its credit points, and even travel hints with the list of its flights." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "in the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to share, Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA wine-blower and ristian source." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "President Obama promised to protect Whistleblowers, but instead, justice has condemned the judiciary than all US governments before him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is too much appreciated by her work as a secret." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">"" "" "" "since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of that a Whistleblowers went to a journalist." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "so we put the PR about the game that should be protected by the first constituency, because the government has more possibilities to come off all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "but just like the technology of the government, the media rights can use the rights to protect their sources better." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "and indeed, they can accept that from the moment in which they contact you rather than in the picture." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "today, there are communication software that hasn't been written as Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "such a technology is SecureDrop, an open-source transition system for Whistleblowers that was developed by us from Freedom of the Press Foundation, and is today developed by Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I work." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "instead of send an e-mail, go to a news-site, just like the Washington Post." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information such as in any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">They will then be encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "so the government cannot secretly accept information secretly, and many of the information that would claim they would not be available from the outset." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is but only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"" "" "" "unfortunately, governments around the world develop new spy technologies that all endanger ourselves." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "it is to ensure that not only technology leader, like Edward Snowden have a chance to share their iniquities." "" "" "" it is just as important to protect the next Whistleblowers, "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "the disproportionate about the problems in the supply of soldiers. or to the next environmental memberships, the alarm suggests about contaminated water of frifle. or a wall of wall insider which warns us against the next financial crisis." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="45">"" "" "" "we actually see emails, the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">"" "" "" "also, there are reports that a ally of brutal Syrian dictator Baschar al-Assad has briefing firms in tax havens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "it is said that a trace of 2 billion US dollars on Russia's President Vladimir Putin will lead to a close friend of children days, a famous cellist." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"" "" "" "now there will be a lot of richer people and others who are waiting for the next release, and to the next release documents." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "now, sounds like the plot of a community, or John-Grisham novel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems weeping from you to me and ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should that be?</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "but the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their fortune in taxoases and not all pay their taxes, then this means less money for major public services such as health care, education, streets." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">There is phenomenal by my organization, global Witness.</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "" "" "in all over the world, media and leading politicians will discuss how secret tax vases of some few have been used to hide their fortune and to wear it -- something we have been discussing and reveal it for ten years." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "" "" "I think many people seem to confusing this whole world and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="59">I put it in front of me like a Matrjoschuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "so we have a company in another company, in another company which makes it almost impossible to really understand who behind these prayers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as journalists or civil society really to understand what matters is." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "I find it interesting also, that there are fewer reports about this matter in the US." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">"" "" "" "presumably, because there has been no prominent Americans in this scandal in this scandal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "now it is not the case that there are no rich Americans, who are hiding their fortune in tax havases." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="65">"" "" "" "however, by the principle of working the tax havens, Mosel has less American customers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="66">"" "" "" "we would have a data leck of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples that have the connections to the USA." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="67">"" "" "" "in fact, it is possible that in some US states you need to add less information to establish a company than to get a library card." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the USA has allowed employees of school areas to cover schoolchildren.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed cheers to cover especially susceptible investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it actually work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a concealed heir to the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "" "" "our investigator gave himself as prime minister, who wanted to bring suspect money into the U.S. to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "we are really shocked, that everyone might make suggestions for a lawyer, how he could transfer his money." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="76">"" "" "" "these were all pretenants. none of these lawyers won us as a client, and of course nothing was handed over to cash. but it shows the problem with this system." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to regard it as single cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It's not about a single lawyer that has made suggestions for our concealed Erilitator.</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single top politician in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">"" "" "" "it is a matter of how the system works, by corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="81">And to overcome this we have to change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We must change the rules to make this sort of behavior difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">"" "" "" "this may sound very deceptive, as if we could do nothing but if nothing has ever changed; as if it is always the rich and the powerful." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist I see that a lot has begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "over the past few years, we have seen folks to more transparency, which concerns the owners of companies." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="86">"" "" "" "the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="87">"" "" "" "since then, the EU's central registers at national level, who really is behind companies in Europe, and who controls it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the uncomfortable facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have brought a bill of bill in both parliamentarians but this does not make progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "" "" "we would really like to see how these Panama-revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure more transparency in the US and globally." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">"" "" "" "we need ordinary people who become angry if they see, how other people can hide their true identity behind pseudoers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="93">We need managers in the economy that stand up and say: "Intransparent" is not good for business. "</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians to recognize the problem, and use it to end this type of intransparency." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "together we can finally finish the intransparency, which now allow this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story as I have been kidnapped once and in the boot space of a red Mazda.</seg>

<seg id="930">"" "" "" "Aristotle defines democracy as the corporate form, in which the open and the poor control the government as a majority." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="939">"" "" "" "while Athenian democracy focused on free citizens, the liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, ultimately a statute for powers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="940">"" "" "" "the liberal democracy arrived only when a full separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was declared to politics, while the economy -- thus the world of corporations -- a democratiy zone was created." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="941">"" "" "" "in our current democracies since that time, when the separation from politics and economy began, an inexorable fight between the two and the economy gradually migrates to politics and dismastered it." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="943">It is not part of a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>

<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong with that point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you so much you were with TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thanks.</seg>
<seg id="1038">"" "" "" "by Roy Price you've never heard most, although he probably is responsible for 22-moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for too many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">It's going back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a leader at Amazon Studios</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "" "" "he is 47 years old, slim, has a spinach and describes himself on Twitter as" movies, TV, technique, tacos. "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">"" "" "" "Roy has a very important job, because he is responsible for making the shows and content to produce the Amazon." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy cannot choose any of these.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">"" "" "" "in other words, he has to find shows that are located right on this curve." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1049">"" "" "" "this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the website IMDB, which shows the rating from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are given." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1050">"" "" "" "will your show be valued at nine and higher, this is a winner." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"" "" "" "these are shows like" Breaking Bad, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that are addictive where you ask a season, your brain asks:" where is there more of these episodes? "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"" "" "" "on the left, here at this end, shows are shows like" Toddler and Tiaras "-- -- which should say enough to you at this end of the curve." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1055">"" "" "" "Roy Price does not get to get on the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to underline" Toddler and Tiaras. "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"" "" "" "he makes more thoughts on the middle cutter, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply inspire them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"" "" "" "the pressure is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something that makes Roy Price nothing to risk." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs a guaranteed success. so he will hold a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">"" "" "" "he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows, then he produced the first episode of each of these shows and makes them online where everybody can watch for free." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon has nothing to go out for free it is going to be correct?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">But they do not know that they are watching during viewing this shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You will be watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"" "" "" "you capture when you start the show, when you pauses, which parts you jumps or watches." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1067">"" "" "" "they collect millions of data to decide with this data, which show they should produce." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "" "" "in fact, they collect data, process this and resulting from it and this is:" Amazon should make a Sitcom over four republican US senators. "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "" "" "yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many remember this show because it was not so good." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">"" "" "" "it's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 -- so something on average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1073">"" "" "" "about the same time at another company, another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, who is always searching for a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it something different." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1074">"" "" "" "instead of organising a contest, he and his team watched the existing data via the Netflix viewer, so the reviews they show the shows where shows they like etc." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1075">"" "" "" "then use this data to find these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, which actors." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1076">"" "" "" "when they had gathered all the parts, they went a venture and decided not to make a Sitcom over four senators but a drama series about a senator." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"" "" "" "yes," House of Cards ". Netflix has landed a hit with it, at least for the first two seasons." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 response on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what has happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">Two very competitive, data consumed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">"" "" "" "they connect these many data and it works super for one of them, but not for the other company." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic precedes the fact that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"" "" "" "when you accumulate millions of dates, for a decision which one meets, you should make a good decision." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You optimise it through very efficient computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"" "" "" "the Mindeste, what can be expected is good TV, or?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1089">"" "" "" "when data analysis is not working, then this is a bit scary, because we live in a time in which we take more and more to take more serious decisions to make serious decisions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone here know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK. that's good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">"" "" "" "multi-health system is a software company and I hope that no one comes into contact with this software ever. come in contact, you are in prison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1093">"" "" "" "if anyone here is in prison and ask for release, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is to determine whether a dismissal is made or not." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1094">"" "" "" "just like with Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad, will be decided whether a person will be good or bad." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1095">"" "" "" "mediocre TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but more years in prison are worse." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1096">"" "" "" "unfortunately, there is evidence that these data analysis, despite the many data," "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1097">"" "" "" "not always creates the best results. that's not always the fact that a company, such as multi-health system, does not know how to use data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data will also be wrongly wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes. even Google makes mistakes sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">"" "" "" "in 2009, Google announced that they can predict data analysis outbreaks from flu, the bad way -- through data analysis of Google's research." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked miraculously and was a great message here. success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"" "" "" "it worked fine, year around year, until it suddenly didn't work anymore," "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"" "" "" "it simply did not work, that was again a sensation, including the release of publication in the magazine" Nature "." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data have experienced users such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"" "" "" "despite all these errors, data will close in the decisions of life -- in the work of law enforcement, in medicine." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">"" "" "" "I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people use unimaginably many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1109">"" "" "" "over the years, I recognized a few patterns through the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1110">Do you need to solve a complex problem if you mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">"" "" "" "first, put this problem into its parts, so that you can analyse the individual parts; as a second one put the items together to summarize a decision." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1112">"" "" "" "sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: taking apart and put together again." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the important facts: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"" "" "" "data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to dismantle the problem and understand it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1115">"" "" "" "they are not suitable for putting parts again, and then come to a decision." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"" "" "" "if there is something that the brain is good, there are parts and pieces again to summarize, even if the information is incomplete, especially when the brain is an expert." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1118">"" "" "" "therefore, I think Netflix was so successful because they have used data and understanding where they belong in the process." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1119">"" "" "" "they use data to better understand their audience, what they wouldn't have been able to put all these parts again and make it a show like" House of Cards "and it does not stand in the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show what meant it meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"" "" "" "they used data to control all their choices, first as they selected about TV-ideas, then selected as the" Alpha House "as a show." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they could say always: "they tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"" "" "" "data is useful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1126">"" "" "" "no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool and in order not to forget it, this device is quite useful." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data I was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "" "" "it is also called" Magic 8 Ball ". it is amazing. for decisions with a Ja- or no question, you only need to shaking the ball to get an answer." highly likely "-- right here at that moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will finite it later with a technology demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"" "" "" "so far I have taken some decisions in my life, and I should have heard on the ball." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1133">"" "" "" "but, as you naturally know if you have the data available, you would like to replace them by anything like data analysis to make better decisions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the fundamental muscle.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "" "" "in this way, the ball is smarter and wiser and klurger. finally, it lies in us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1136">"" "" "" "and I felt this as being very encouraging message that, in spite of the great amount of data, it pays off to make decisions to be an expert in what you do, and risks to go." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1137">"" "" "" "because at the end, there are not the data, but the risks associated with which you end up at the right end of the curve." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
