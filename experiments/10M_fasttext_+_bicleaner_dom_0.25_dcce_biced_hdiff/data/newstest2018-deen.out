Munich 1856 : four cards that change your view of the city
a Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt where young people should meet today .
a mines chapel that is now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers cultiv@@ ate the former reason of farmers .
the oldest official map in Munich fo@@ sters exciting stories about days .
it anno@@ ys when maps are not currently available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it knows everyone who had to be exciting , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a walking street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the historical maps of the digital Bayern At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the ge@@ op@@ ort Bavaria of the state government , are anything but currently very illumin@@ ating . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then it is clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the distribution area of the Munich Mercury , since the 19th century . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the digital Bayern Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work that can not be recognized as such .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; into the big picture postcard set for cities and municipalities more detailed maps , so @-@ called urine leaves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these were written according to the Bavarian Authority management between 18@@ 10 and 1864 and resulted in the first dimension of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted a survey of the occupied land and had a top@@ ographic recording in Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; la@@ stly , when the French troops attacked the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 18@@ 01 : today &apos;s neigh@@ bors who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern map . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Elec@@ tor Max IV Joseph drives the project ahead and founded the &quot; top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische surve@@ ying management .
the Author for Munich came from 1856 and can be found as any other one of the Bavarian State Library &apos;s website .
the comparison early / Today is the most impressive example of the capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example of this is sub @-@ ordination that is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ end@@ ling was constructed 21 years after the map creation , so 1877 , in the Munich area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today Gi@@ raff@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ send@@ lings are situated in 1856 along the today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße which was first named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er in 1878 , a leader of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West Park is seen here you can see nothing but fields - at first sight : there is a small @-@ piece card with dozens lines and numbers : hand@@ written number of pieces taken from the so @-@ called &quot; urine smell &quot; from which the land tax was derived .
small par@@ c@@ els exist today no more - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of land &quot; land in sun . &quot;
a large green area is distinguished north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 was the scene of the Oktober@@ fest , was in the 19th century still a meadow - and no concrete desert . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of Is@@ ar the historical map gives a gli@@ mpse of the history of the psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the valley of exposure , one reads in the area of today &apos;s Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , not only the street name &quot; at the Gast@@ on &quot; or from the hill &quot; At the ventilation &quot; - but also in big letters &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld road once people lost people with ma@@ dness .
in 1858 @-@ 59 the Munich @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt was formed on the Au@@ er Lü@@ nen . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from 1872 , Dr. Bernhard of G@@ ud@@ den led the furnishings - that psychiat@@ rist , who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he was advanced for his time and ended the acquisition of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he prohibited the personnel to apply violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Director of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has employed for an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ alt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for 280 patients first was first place , later it was extended to 500 places . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at some point , this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Cir@@ culation centre in the hair of 1905 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost is one of Germany &apos;s largest psych@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the premises of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt we encounter young people in the Munich Sal@@ es@@ um .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and went to a youth home with vocational training .
the football pitch of the TS@@ V Munich East is located east of the 1980s .
in 2015 the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; erected in architec@@ turally based on the origin of origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt that was destroyed during the Second World War .
the Mari@@ en@@ platz was named in 1856 as &quot; Main Place &quot; and the department name called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot;
decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich .
in December 1944 the Al@@ lies were many holes in the city center .
a big stayed until today - on the Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English Institute , small business buildings and a tomb kap@@ elle from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where this month &apos;s ground @-@ breaking ceremony takes place on 5 April 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the sli@@ der sli@@ der , the old Munich map can be compared to today &apos;s aerial view - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
civil rights published travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German National Union for promoting color has issued a warning for coloured people , due to discri@@ min@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks of the State to Mis@@ sour@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which will enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American trav@@ ellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ tians , as a series of question@@ able , racy @-@ based inci@@ dents in the whole country , &quot; says it in the opinion of the group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recently approved law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which aims to bear people harder , aim to release discrimination , and admit the group &apos;s warning authorities , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they have injuries of the civil rights that happen to people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they will be put together because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the president of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first such warning , which has issued the organization for a state in the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the group referred to as ra@@ cial abuse against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ anders died at the beginning of the yearly , after having been no gasoline during the journey through the state and was accused of being accused of ven@@ ison by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council also indicates a recent report from the Office of the Mis@@ sour@@ i Office , which is shown in the state 75 percent more common than white . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware that their families , friends and employees inform about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to be willing , if you bring yourself money or the relatives know that they are travelling through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hectares , after the latest numbers from the FB@@ I , which set the state in relation to the number of such injuries on the 16th status of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the war@@ nings is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it harder , a company due for residential or employment discrimination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had adopted travel war@@ nings for Texas and Arizona , having committed local law en@@ forcement agencies , which will contribute to other race pro@@ positions because of immigration laws . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; travel war@@ nings will typically be issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but recently , stak@@ eholders have used the measure to certain laws and trends within the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the f@@ im@@ print project is elementary
the Fis@@ her@@ b@@ en project is a successful project and is continuing next year .
the CDU German Bundestag and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have provided a picture to the CDU German parliament .
at the right gra@@ vey@@ ard of the family of Schwen@@ demann , representatives of the Fisch@@ erb@@ ach CDU @-@ village meeting met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ u@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Markus Schwen@@ demann at first showed insights into his company , where he has 55 hectares of law@@ ns and 40 hectares of forest , preser@@ ves 40 cows and also many young animals and accommod@@ ated in five apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &quot; Black Forest &quot; is one of the alternative mark@@ eters away for the milk of its cows , so swi@@ ft@@ y .
exclusively regional at the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ ste .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since he is also a BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman of Fish erb@@ ach , he considered the &quot; elementary &quot; project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can not achieve profitable areas on such steep surfaces .
the gra@@ ssy expan@@ se for much work and much must be handled with the sense of engine .
&quot; we have here with the terms and conditions to fight with the top@@ ography &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2003 he adopted the elite farm and cultiv@@ ate these without chemical plant protection and fer@@ til@@ is@@ ers , even if it does not lead to organic farming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider , he was clear : &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognised the importance of the light projection and is happy about the leader @-@ promotion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with costs of 3000 to 4,000 Euros per hectare , farmers need to be supported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope , that with the dri@@ v@@ ation of the surfaces a while could be gone out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest treasure we have , are people who work in agriculture and thought about how they continue their operation , &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often standing in criticism because of the promotion .
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were completely fenced in 2013 .
the maintenance area is thus 40 hectares that can not be cleared until at least 20@@ 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half of the total costs of 71 500 euros was promoted by the leader , a quarter contributed by the municipality of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the farmers remained 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ gevity of the f@@ ences &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said piv@@ ot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you do not make a really good job without farmers and ma@@ ids it does not work . &quot;
also for Peter White : &quot; best food is produced here . &quot;
the landscape care guideline ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg offers the state subsi@@ dies of wheat protection .
the goal is the revel@@ ations of the Black Forest .
requirement is the presence of a funding pl@@ ung@@ ing of the L@@ PR .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the enclosed area should be not slu@@ gg@@ able ( Hang@@ ing over 35 percent ) and must be threatened by collecting an arm@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the con@@ fer@@ ment project 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build almost 16 kilometers of fence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the maintenance area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is nothing sacred anymore ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes itself from the Statue of Liberty
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is , when they begin to attack the statues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein &apos;s at the Fir@@ &apos;s Square in Bagh@@ dad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e from CN@@ N on the proposal of the President to the dra@@ stic restri@@ cting of the legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to stay fair and Miller did not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty im@@ it@@ ators would have lived for him if he had done it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he took their meaning , and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the memorial , his base was added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta ch@@ imp@@ ed : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go to a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of American freedom that the world is en@@ lighten@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the poem , to which you relate to that later was added , and not part of the original Statue of Liberty is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Miller lies in fac@@ tual properly , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about the contemp@@ or@@ ating words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invites to take away any old immigrants , but to breathe freely , to breathe freely , / to the falling waste of your rich co@@ asts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the falling waste was clearly seen on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not engage in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ ump USA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this conflict due to the significance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural confron@@ tation : it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lazarus and her friends who are preparing to place their words after her death - knew very well that they accomplished a highly political action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sculpture should show the inter@@ connections between French and American rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ism , represented in a worn @-@ out classical visual imaging the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lazarus had this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives himself a very different name : mother of ex@@ iles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the connection of the encoder with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup , and a devastating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and just like Lazarus changes the significance of the statue , people wanted to change the right wing from right wing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the big scre@@ aming rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Bap@@ tist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is trying to bring the American flame into the um@@ my world : &quot; Lady Liberty is going on .
it should carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not shine the way into the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something .
the meaning of statue is whole and even a matter of stand@@ point of perception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of Lazarus was in this to see how they had seen from the exhau@@ sting , but hop@@ eful people after leng@@ thy and often terrible trips on the decks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in the true sense of seeing the world from a perspective of people , seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their statue says to them the words of hope and welcome , which they must hear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and this is of course not the perspective that you want to recognize Miller and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their tor@@ ch shall not shine through the way , but the hatred , which is the only source of power to ign@@ ite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black aims the Scottish members of the UK
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle reminds himself of a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the UK from the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the performance director of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black says that the 16 @-@ strong Scottish cont@@ ingent of world championship will be a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London in 2017 which will start on Friday .
Black believes that &quot; in Scotland something special develops &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand and we will continue to find it until we &apos;ll find it , &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I speak with people at the Scottish Institute of Sports , and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with that which they have done .
and also by type on the street corner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals of medals , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ are , who can compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m circuit while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected by the team to the team captain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest .
her captain &apos;s speech was incredible . &quot; says Black .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a series of athletes , no matter whether they were Scottish , or where ever they live or train , went out of space and felt very motivated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ ze brought quite naturally were great . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commonwealth Silver Medal won , who will compete with their fifth world championships at the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it &apos;s an incredible thing that 16 sh@@ all@@ ots are in the British crew . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this path leads to five British and two European records , last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m rounds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1.500 m running , is another shr@@ otto that was given to the British team TRI@@ ALS and the Anniversary games of the British team TRI@@ ALS and the Anniversary Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Do@@ yle reminds himself of her first World Championships when the only other sh@@ al@@ lot in the team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell was .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the theme cap@@ tains says that they are very proud of the fact that many of their fellow country@@ men are not only part of the team , but in some cases also in the medals and with the fin@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is special about the team captain , is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , but we know that my team mate is tuned for me and made it something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; obviously I &apos;m very proud of all of the sh@@ all@@ ots that belong to the team .
it only shows how far we came .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb to Po@@ dien . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what concerns my speech as a captain ?
yes I think they went well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only noted that in this situation we are very happy , because we have a home world championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , it &apos;s really important to put on this home support and benefit from that we are back in the Olympic Stadium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out and compete , and it simply will be so a great atmosphere there out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blocking critics via Facebook : don &apos;t bu@@ zz you by a public office if you don &apos;t have to toler@@ ate the heat of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of everything , from the internal policy up to its political principles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ch@@ imp@@ acting on criticism .
but he did not put his critics to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; the freedom can be taken away - and , stupid and silent , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that brings me to Mary@@ land to Governor Larry H@@ ogan , who must work on it more like Washington . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gan@@ s employees have blocked the contributions from at least 450 people , deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union promised him this week at the beginning of this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Govern@@ ors &apos; staff dis@@ missed the complaint as fri@@ vo@@ l , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook &quot; so many people said .
but it is important .
and it is particularly important when there is a type like H@@ ogan .
this is a rep@@ ubli@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second largest agreement of the 50 Govern@@ ors of the Nation .
H@@ ogan is no re@@ ac@@ tionary he@@ aters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state , and strict observ@@ ance of the principles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was also very sk@@ ill@@ fully to use Facebook when primarily funds to connect with his voters , and playing his ha@@ ired head after chemotherapy on his side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , blocking of persons appearing on the governor &apos;s side - which is called a public Forum and will be paid by public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan@@ s Spe@@ aker Ch@@ asse defended the Government &apos;s actions and argu@@ ed that the blocking of comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is too easy to use the p@@ lowing of tro@@ op or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ asser@@ ted people , which vibr@@ ate online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the post spoke with some of the real people that had been blocked by H@@ ogan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and these are just genuine people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , a entrepren@@ eur and a pastor , no tro@@ ll@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they all said that their comments was resp@@ ect@@ ful , thou@@ ght@@ ful and not prof@@ ited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pastor zi@@ pped the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to the Ho@@ gan@@ s Catholic faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ asser@@ ted , but she asked to break H@@ ass@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate and other current news , &quot; wrote in the commentary box of the message &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not consider this idea when a number of people on position takes place , then they are considered to be so @-@ called collective employment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what the governor &apos;s staff as &quot; concentrated anti @-@ spam attack , &quot; would probably call &quot; Inter@@ cession &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by being simply blocked a critic , or deleted a negative comment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is much cleaner than in earlier days , when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical guides and to burn them silence or demonstr@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but exactly this happens digitally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ogan is not the first public civil servant , who will critic@@ ises that he has vacc@@ inated us Facebook and other social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
President Tr@@ ump is compl@@ ained by Twitter users that have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County Council last the First Am@@ end@@ ment , according to the U.S. District Apostle James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , having a voters ab@@ sent from her Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and in K@@ entu@@ cky Governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be that difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the time of Washington , the time of affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ lies between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous let@@ ter@@ ies beat on his lead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and even then Washington had anonymous Tro@@ l@@ le .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people , the p@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; used , wrote all letters of newspapers , the Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Peti@@ tions , who critic@@ ised his position on the treaty of Am@@ ity , acquired trade and shipping with Britain , according to historical documents that were collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he has not brought it to silence .
freedom of speech and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes on domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the next three days , the former Europeans No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for the coming three days to the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , which led late next year in the Ar@@ ts@@ field Links to the final round , joined the new location and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved his glory with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from his best side . it is in a great state .
Jerry worked a great job when he fixed this place .
he is an eag@@ erly advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his achievement here .
this is a great show@@ case for this course . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is pleased to defend the first time for the first time , even though he won the European Tour in his 32 @-@ year career as well as at the European Challenge Tour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that feels really special , &quot; he said the player in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t defend the Extremadura Open , as it won in the year after I had won them from the program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
return to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos;s a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the memories of the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year here to win . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one , which we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came after his 50th birthday this year to the European Senior Tour , returns to the action on a home soil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this event will be the first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Open Open in 2013 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s always a little more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well but you feel the additional pressure too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really enjoyed playing , and I played a solid golf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m glad we went so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trio on the field are the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Bro@@ h@@ ur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ulty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Or@@ r and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce include the six pieces of sh@@ all@@ ots on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ timer , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung bu@@ ds by passive smoking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past two decades , less people have died of passive smoking in the lung cancer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists at the Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf University Hospital ( UK@@ E ) come in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates one can result in 167 lung cancer attacks on passive smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said tuition Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a comparison , he went up with his own study on this issue of 1994 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were still 400 lung car@@ cases due to passive smoking per year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the field of home terminals , the situation is complicated than susp@@ ects , as there is a lot of hi@@ des in the underground , which should not be noted in the plans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the traffic , which once again ob@@ struc@@ ts the construction work , represents a big problem for the construction unit of St@@ ump@@ p . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of drivers from red lights and barriers is already enormous . &quot; says Hein@@ ze .

poverty and death in Indonesian gold@@ land
if Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i cook the dinner there is no heat .
they even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in its wood house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ ele in the un@@ quiet Indonesian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; Not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after half an hour the scar@@ c@@ als are drawn and swal@@ lowed with e@@ fri@@ es , innocent hands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay ground - it has no furniture , where it also conducts its daily work , e.g. dresses with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as youngest of the four wives of their man you have no fields assigned .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course late to work is dangerous : most of the vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink it , and there are soldiers from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no one dar@@ es to walk around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock . &quot; she says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an existing movement which touched for independence from the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which enter@@ tained control over the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal notice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Papua New Guinea , part of the east part of the island . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is so located as it deser@@ ts . the journey includes a 90 minute flight from the provincial town of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire , and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive by car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no public transportation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city with around 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is made of wooden houses surrounded by bam@@ boo cabins , which were converted into different yellow @-@ brown tones by r@@ ust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only very few visits have made their journey here , but journalists and practically no foreign citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived you Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ an a God called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were other changes too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wear this clothing , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and indicates on its vibrant , hand woven Tur@@ ban , her dar@@ ker shirts and their bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
Papua is Indonesia of the p@@ oo@@ rest province where 28 % of people live in poverty and alphabe@@ tisation rates in Asia .
but it is also of Indonesia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest and profitable gold mine of the world , gra@@ ss@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ ic@@ ai in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3.000 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has reduced to 3.1 billion US dollars and copper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Papua New resources are valued at the valued 78 billion US dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , these riches are a source of mis@@ ery for the Papua to ensure that Indonesia &apos;s most powerful military is preserved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a study from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 paid almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150,000 US dollars at one single officer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ anic demands after a greater autonomy thre@@ aten this golden glow and are treated as mer@@ cil@@ ess .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to activists of activists , more than 500,000 stocks have been killed and thousands have been ped and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indonesian army . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission in Pap@@ u@@ as , in the 1970 &quot; s , Mass@@ es in Pap@@ u@@ as became a genocide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the region alone , Indonesian police arrested more than 3.@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators in the last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all say it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a report by the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Brisbane taken from the year 2016 , in the reports of atro@@ cities and torture - rape and electro@@ supplements are particularly popular with another report - and the brutal defeat of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s difficult to number the number of victims since every week inci@@ dents , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; screws have reinforced , since Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s resources have an influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % of Christian , but demo@@ graphic developments changed because Muslim economic stran@@ ts come from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sumatra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the migrants started to sell chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than local Papua home , &quot; explains Ab@@ eth You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ ic@@ ai @-@ native to the capital town of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has the native Papua - the m@@ um @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; from Papua New Market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Indonesian President of Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popular in Volk@@ sm@@ al and Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised the ine@@ qualities and the inf@@ rin@@ gement in Papua New Year in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Zimmermann insured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Pan@@ ic@@ ai - on the way to the Presi@@ dential Palace in Jak@@ arta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in Papua New York has changed little changes , and today the people feel betra@@ yed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken , because we agreed in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the anticip@@ ation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice is restored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai cur@@ ated only two months after j@@ ow@@ is &apos;s inauguration in October . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 7 December 2014 there was a group of 11 children outside and singing Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali as two ind@@ ones@@ ian soldiers broke through the darkness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fri@@ ghtened children told them that they should turn off their head@@ lamps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the soldiers took a stum@@ bling on its sound , and later came back to four soldiers , the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the soldiers , who had drunk , and defeated the group with their guns , spoke sacrif@@ ices and witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then one of the soldiers led to the group of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child who has 16 years old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , became so hard to hit the coma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few hours later , the building of the nearby governmental commission was set fire and the situation escal@@ ated the next day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered themselves on a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command centre to challenge justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were crushed by the orph@@ an@@ ies and carried the Wa@@ ita dance - running a bir@@ d@@ song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago .
some demonstr@@ ators started to tow to police and military post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers had sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; when the masses were more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it is not released in an official list of TIM@@ E that has not been released . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto quad@@ t@@ els of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threat@@ ening danger and called to return home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my left wrist , &quot; he said TIM@@ E on the veranda of his colourful wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who was fired , but says that the bul@@ let came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired . &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times so his c@@ ousin , the witness of shooting was .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to be sure that he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who carries out only a name , the TIM@@ E in dark mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the che@@ que indicator of the Papua @-@ police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said Rep@@ orters , that his officers wanted to secure their station only &quot; because they attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people dro@@ pping to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man for the Papua @-@ police , Commissioner P@@ ud@@ jo Sul@@ ei@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more injured .
the news about the k@@ illings did not begin on the following day &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i stayed in Jay@@ ap@@ ura with a passionate speech , in which he expressed an sympath@@ ies for families of victims and s@@ ware to the historical ab@@ norm@@ alities in Papua . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like that this case is resolved promptly , so that in the future it will no longer happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Sen@@ anto Minister of Security said in October 2016 that he establish an extra@@ judicial mechanism for sett@@ ling historical human rights violations .
but the expressions started almost immediately .
&quot; most of the injuries have occurred long ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and early 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we under@@ takes to walk these steps , but there are processes that must go through , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then Th@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke to the TIM@@ E on 5 June in Jak@@ arta , and said that he had no plans in Papua a complaint mechanism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; charged the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in East Tim@@ or were accused of alleged that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Papua War have already been settled , including the pan@@ i@@ ai def@@ aults . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims participated in such alle@@ g@@ ations with gri@@ ev@@ ous un@@ believers .
&quot; I &apos;ve been inter@@ viewed in the last three years but there was no progress &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es .
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says that he was still alive years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid of &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid to get arrested by the military , fear to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ ic@@ ai fear , to discuss the incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says that he was beaten by the military , after he helped to bury four of the victims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I was buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military was searching for me , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ wer@@ ies have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police attacked the vill@@ agers in Pan@@ ic@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during a confron@@ tation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , who refused to bring a conscious man to the hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ ma , was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the road to hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the vill@@ agers prot@@ ested before the firm &apos;s location .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones to officers , re@@ acted by warning signs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but locals say that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian param@@ ilit@@ ary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be reven@@ ge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i , who lived in close proximity to the hospital and witness how the last here is TIM@@ E . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I hid myself in my house two days . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called upon to withdraw the officers of the officers , and withdraw the police Brigade from the sphere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pan@@ ic@@ ai was always an un@@ rested content for the Indonesian government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lack of sen@@ sel@@ ess development strengthens the Dis@@ satisfaction of the Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dani and Dam@@ al , which inhab@@ it the green high@@ lands of Papua New . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of them joined the &quot; Free State Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel army which claims to defend the rights of the State , announ@@ cing copies and kidn@@ apping of Indonesian soldiers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the top @-@ O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ cat@@ an Kog@@ o@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in response to these thousands of people in Pan@@ ic@@ ai were arrested and arbit@@ rar@@ ily taken into custody , under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing the national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some never go up again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among men in Papua New Pan@@ ic@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten town . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice that is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of the sweet potato . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they keep the bulk of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ten pieces of emer@@ ovo were only 10.000 Indonesian Rup@@ iah ( 75 cents ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the indigenous and the new migrants have grown , since the opening of new flight gro@@ oves to the Nab@@ ire airport in larger numbers have arrived . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the few jobs that exist in the region , are usually taken to the better educated and weal@@ thy migrants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Papua do rarely have capital or the necessary abilities to compete for their own companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the young people are not interested in keeping in the village ... because here there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the President of the Pan@@ ic@@ ai tribe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua
beyond that constra@@ ints remain st@@ ably ten@@ se in the reporting of international media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Basi@@ l@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported to Papua coordination with related institutions from Papua , although the rare photos were given to films . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ins , the Deputy director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of j@@ ow@@ is election campaign were able to raise awareness and development restrictions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia and Western pap@@ y@@ ua : visa @-@ ref@@ usal and a black list , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of press control means , that the international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to the immediate neighbourhood of Pap@@ u@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March , six Pacific countries - Ton@@ ga , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the mar@@ sh@@ all@@ islands and the Solomon Islands - the UN Human Rights Council , the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same countries historically as the O@@ PM supported .
the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha Na@@ si@@ r rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system so that it is difficult to tu@@ ck the evidence of human rights accidents . &quot;
people want to know more foreign governments to know this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , attended by human rights Ambassador Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura broke their silence and pressing him . &quot; we want freedom to join the session but wants to remain anonymous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2019 , Indonesia has a further presidential election , but the Papua say that it &apos;s unlikely to vote again for Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good inten@@ tions , but he is involved in the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai notes , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the President of the St@@ em . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wants the j@@ ok@@ i people know that the Pan@@ ic@@ ai people knows that it lives under the constant threat of a atro@@ cities , in poor areas and health services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like others , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as one &quot; guilt , &quot; which he has to pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the threats and in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ations , families of the pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ shot brought a recent symbolic act of de@@ compos@@ tion : the bodies of a victim was buried on a site right across the police and the military station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they know that they may never go through justice , but at least they have not forgotten their crimes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed ; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with sp@@ ouses .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ pers from Dubai to the second time
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a fire happened on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai to flee through hundreds of inhabitants , from the 3@@ 37 meters high , 79 @-@ story building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the second fir@@ ing that f@@ ades in only two years by the high @-@ rise , which is in random the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch Tower ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries have not been reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we slept and we got up with the alarm bell and at the cry of the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to arrive from the 50th floor to the bottom , a inhabitants who had its name as George ang@@ ab , Reuters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dub@@ ais &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting action at 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) , the fire extingu@@ ished and the building cooled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the government said that I work on providing accommodation for the people concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident can have questions about the safety of materials , which are used in areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an examination by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 discovered that the biggest part of the Co@@ ver@@ ing Cl@@ adding , the outer fair@@ ing for decoration or insulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the UK , the police said that the system of records for isolation and facing at the London Gren@@ fur @-@ tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire which died about 80 people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Radio Association ( IT@@ F ) has been with his great Davis Cup at the AGM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the session in Ho Chi Minh City , this sport @-@ revolutionary proposal was to play by Davis Cup single only on two races , rather than supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the many often very long but also very estimated five @-@ sentence classics stay in the traditional grade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 6@@ 3,@@ 54 percent of the member states agreed for Reform , the objective of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was only scar@@ c@@ ely missed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of this iconic and historical competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the seek@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only for the vote , after a lot of inclusion , the proposal had already come to apply the finals at a neutral location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new from 2018 will only be compar@@ atively minor details : so the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be the best host in the first round in the first round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to reduce the costs of organis@@ ers , the requirements in training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and the players will have to complete fewer official media appoint@@ ments in front of the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 1 out of 5 US travelers brings the forbidden items into the aer@@ op@@ lane , finding a pol@@ l &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a pol@@ l pol@@ yp@@ ass@@ ing survey found that more than 20 % aware of the inspection points of the US Transportation Security Administration s@@ mu@@ g@@ gle at least 6 percent , while carrying the airplane while acci@@ dentally carrying the forbidden knife or other objects with blades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less than 1 percent claimed they would have discovered that they had travelled ir@@ ony with arms , am@@ mun@@ ition or explo@@ sives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the survey of more than 1,000 persons - which was conducted by a Jet @-@ Char@@ ter@@ service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was also noted that younger trav@@ ellers must desp@@ ise the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the respon@@ dents that they tried to do with something which was banned from T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent m@@ illenni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , were compared to generation X . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common items which were deliber@@ ately dropped by T@@ SA agents , were food and liquids . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 3 percent , all objects with blades must be borne by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of male respon@@ dents have also confirmed that they had inten@@ tionally eliminated the forbidden drug . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said it told travelers in the whole country , to find out how many acci@@ dently s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling through the airport security and how many it had inten@@ tionally done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a surprise that people who were most s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling and un@@ aware of the most common s@@ mu@@ g@@ ard , those who were most frequently flying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company , however , suggests that the T@@ SA guidelines are a little complicated and conf@@ using . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people are often uncertain about which liquids they may take with or how much of it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , no surprise that the largest amount of banned liquids purchased by T@@ SA are prohibited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a time , people thought T@@ SA could watch books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
liquids are permitted on domestic routes but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k does not care : tens of thousands of Tesla customers to cancel .
electric @-@ thous@@ and@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k liked to offer a huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tesla Model 3 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , he has been under@@ taking that a part of the customer has gone back their obligation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from the always tri@@ ump@@ tuous numbers for sales of sales and even more huge numbers , Tesla @-@ Chef El@@ on Mus@@ k also showed a different , less glorious number : the cancellations made at the new mass market model 3 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past few months , Mus@@ k often had raised more than 500.000 pre@@ adjustments for the new car , whose extra@@ dition has just started . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now Mus@@ k cle@@ ars a : of the total 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre@@ adjustments , 63@@ ,000 have already been with@@ drawn again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
critics have always pointed out that it is only a non @-@ committ@@ al reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a cancellation paid the amount of Tesla the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1,000 dollars and the UK 1,000 Po@@ unds ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently 45@@ 5.000 such non @-@ binding reservations are currently used in a telephone conference with anal@@ ysts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , the cancellation of until now about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem , but the Tesla head does not believe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
its argument : this challenge is not focused on demand but on the production site .
a total of Tesla 8@@ 4.000 trucks supplied last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2018 it is supposed to be - 500,000 - 500,000 by 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k currently costs 1800 reservations each day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who can expect a &quot; Model 3 &quot; for the second half of 2018 - if Tesla then creates his n@@ ag@@ el@@ new , never in practice tested production roads with maximum capacity utilization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but comes there to bigger delays , then the un@@ connecting of the reservations may be the problem for Tesla . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for then , the company can &apos;t deny the content of our customers in dro@@ ves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
EPA @-@ Chef P@@ ru@@ itt withdraw@@ s himself because of the re@@ lu@@ ct@@ ant the rules of Obama @-@ Er@@ a to reduce emissions
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a day after he was filed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the head of the Environmental Protection Agency , did not delay its earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change , when his agency proved to improve the needs of government entities compared to previous fail@@ ures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not mention the complaint filed against his previous job in a Federal Employment Tribunal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a term that ran on 1 October for States , to keep the standards of 2015 for bott@@ led ozone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would check compliance with a year , in order to study more time to study his authority and to avoid &quot; inter@@ f@@ ere with local decisions or economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , had long been a reliable opponent to regulatory compliance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeated that to block or delayed the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sudden conversion from Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ itts regulatory run@@ back agenda .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month a Federal Constitutional Court in Washington decided that the EPA @-@ selling has exceeded its authority as he tried to transfer a rule of Obama administration , oil and gas companies to control and reducing meth@@ an@@ le@@ cks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a review published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his revers@@ al with ozone standards is simply the read@@ iness of EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely execution of the new standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under earlier administ@@ rations , the EPA often accused the dead@@ lines for carrying out and then waiting the date for carrying out and in an agreement said P@@ ru@@ itt , which the EPA promised more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings and we take Fri@@ sten seriously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority that gi@@ veth us , seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the opinion of EPA , that P@@ ru@@ itt has made its &quot; powers for delay and all other legally available authority to ensure that the provisions are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Congress push for a more comprehensive re @-@ setting of the ozone rules .
a bill in the last month &apos;s bill to delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet completed in the Senate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the New York General Pro@@ curator Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who did compl@@ ain the Coalition on this week , said the Group intended to maintain the legal pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the return of EPA - after our cavi@@ ties - is an important profit for health and safety of these 6.7 million New York , who are directly affected by the smo@@ g , said tail@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this case , New York , California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minnes@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Cob@@ alt Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soil @-@ Oz@@ on , when pollut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems for sensitive groups , and every year can contribute to thousands of premature death cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
representatives of public health care and environ@@ ment@@ alists celebrated in a surprising course of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is worried about how much pressure does it takes to receive this sensible step by the responsible person for protecting the air that we inhal@@ e , &quot; said L@@ ori Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we must continue to fight against the ide@@ ological cru@@ pul@@ sion of the Tr@@ ump government to compl@@ ain about environmental contam@@ in@@ ers and their particular interests . &quot;
tum@@ ors celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 750 years St Hil@@ arius church : on the occasion of the Jubilee of the Berg@@ church on Sunday , 16 July to 16,@@ 30 PM invited to a Ser@@ en@@ ade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village is the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , a popular place to stay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the visitors of the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z @-@ Ser@@ en@@ ade can en@@ chant themselves in this powerful place .
rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the resort have made friends and benef@@ actors of our concerns .
Walter Martini stressed : &quot; it is a unique small object . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was mentioned in documents for the first time : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the buried parish church of Eber@@ hard by Hor@@ a and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the document evi@@ den@@ ces on the Tum@@ our mountain apart from the former parish church , one of the former parish church one belonged to the Church or the Pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ recht and not the other way around . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there were people there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it emerged from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt in 1858 , it was still visible in the village of Tum@@ our , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third one of the grand settlement of the village . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
old maps from the period around the year 1600 sub@@ divide those historical circumstances .
the Pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ recht originated from the early medieval y@@ k law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a gentle@@ man , built a church , occupied and occupied with a priest , remained the owner of this church and was able to inherit all its owners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the right to appoint a pastor or to the bishop a new priest .
there were three altars in the church and two bells in the tower .
the size of the two pieces of Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the newly created bell stopped the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be released in 1942 later during the Second World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) windows have been loaded and bel@@ fry bel@@ lies were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aky .
in 17@@ 96 French troops were enc@@ amped near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and the church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened in 1809 .
until 1869 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demolished .
only the church tower was built .
in the New Year of the year 18@@ 34 a storm became the steep@@ le and half crashed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demolished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only the still existing tower giant has remained as the witness of the 750 years old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em work by the &quot; Schaff@@ y pen@@ sion@@ ers &quot; as the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn the Hil@@ arius plant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as organizers invite friends and promot@@ er Tum@@ lin@@ gens on Sunday , 16 July , to the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade to the old cemetery in St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is designed by the com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with his word contribution from Kurt Kü@@ bler and Reinhold Matt@@ e@@ is .
the village of Hartmut Rom@@ ann talks about the face .
the program starts at 16.@@ 30 .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 a.@@ m .
the trunk takes place in front of the cemetery for the k@@ lang of the ser@@ en@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to forest , &quot; organis@@ ers the fantastic view out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ser@@ en@@ ade takes place just on dry weather .
the organis@@ ers hope for many supporters for the obtaining of the historical St. Hil@@ arius plant which is of importance for tum@@ ors and audi@@ tors .
the friends and promot@@ er rap@@ ists feel particularly committed to home care as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Martini .
Society wants to examine approval of wind bikes
&quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim does not have a legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the State Council .
the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim is called &quot; Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ ded ( CDU ) called to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
it must be illegal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association argu@@ ed that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , no wind turbines can have existed in the town border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal a wind power station exists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within this concentration camp , construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible , but the concentration area also causes an exclusion of wind energy for the rest of the city area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
such zones are to avoid a &quot; simpli@@ fication &quot; of the landscape .
a second wind @-@ concentrate zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette had decided that the town of Vier@@ sen had not approved a second wind @-@ concentrate zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but it had not approved the district &apos;s district in Düsseldorf for a few days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of scheduled legal basis , the granted authori@@ zation is un@@ lawful and therefore to take back , said Christoph Er@@ kens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of things : the municipality had decided again before the summer break again in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; an approval of the district government remains .
said : &quot; in this respect the organization of authori@@ zation for the construction of wind turbines is not legally ruled out . &quot;
the circle re@@ affir@@ ms the entrance to the call .
&quot; the respective letters has been received during last week at the circle of quad@@ ru@@ sen . &quot; explained a speaker .
the circle is taking them to test the matter again .
but it is unlikely to do that the procedure is hal@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a view of the proceedings at the Administ@@ rative Court , the circle was not subject to the argument of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NEW Re , a NEW subsidiary of the NEW , plans on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette to build four each 200 metres high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already last year , the company , in which the town was in@@ directly involved , is concluded with the owner of approximately 65 hectares of land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the construction of the four wind turbines , electricity needs to be covered with around 11 400 households - this corresponds to around one @-@ fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ quarter households . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re will invest some 20 million euros .
the green light gave the green light to buy three wind turbines in the wind farm Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen and a partnership at a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg .
car and tractor crane together : woman dies with terrible accident
one aw@@ ful traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn district ) .
a woman was killed in deadly .
two more people were slightly wounded .
the state road remained blocked by hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after police information , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch accompanied their cars within the accompanying driving with their 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as supporting the L 333 in the direction of Bo@@ gel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
city and dealers planning &quot; Home @-@ shopping &quot; -@@ weekend
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bath Langen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region are to be re@@ discovered in the downtown area in September , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the commercial association and city management want to use the weekend of the 8th and 9th of September to attract the residents to shopping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the president of the Trade Lic@@ ens@@ one , Christian König , the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; -@@ weekend will susp@@ end the customers with their own city off the usual supermarket goods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is also a market with regional providers and similar to the market .
indigenous companies should also present themselves with their apprentic@@ eship .
businesses in the city centre shall also invite the &quot; midnight @-@ shopping &quot; city centre .
the action does not only destination the inhabitants of the city and the nearby region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in preparation , commerci@@ als in radio , an internet video and printed bag that refer to the action weekend , is Christian König . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
city Management and Trade Association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
the trade association and the city are going into another stage of the project &quot; Attra@@ ctive city center . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these include new promotions as the first &quot; Active @-@ Day &quot; to the well @-@ established Sunday , talks with all commercial and f@@ ades to move them to active participation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attractive offers also on Saturday , and shipping to park fees on this day are part of the concept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
customer needs to be re@@ opened or re@@ developed again .
these include courses and tourists .
but many locals also have lost downtown shopping with a look .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , all would have to contribute to the city center - up to the owners , the farms of the whole city and associations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was to overcome the le@@ th@@ arg@@ y on a network that was partly bro@@ ader , king in the spring . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Birgit Stre@@ ich , head of the Chamber of Commerce in Mühl@@ hausen that will take part in the third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day , for the first time five Thur@@ ing@@ ian cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to Bad Langen@@ sal@@ za this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ er@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the day should adverti@@ se for the appreciation of the local trade and its significance for the common to our cities , &quot; says Stre@@ ich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the action of the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Commerce and many partners also make clear that every citizen could be able to influence ourselves with its buying behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two dead and several injured after explosion in US school
during construction there was a gas explosion in the school building .
new people were hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a gas explosion in the US city Minneapolis , two people were killed and nine were injured , some of them difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the fire brig@@ ade was on Wednesday ( local time ) still an vulner@@ ability in critical condition .
a human being died when a part of a school building was over@@ thrown by the explosion .
a first susp@@ end was also born dead later .
the victims were en@@ acted by the dead .
as a disaster we suspected the authorities at a gas pipeline .
in the resort only few people were held in the AF@@ ha@@ ha Academy building .
dr@@ unk@@ y placed after sk@@ ill@@ ated tran@@ scription of calling Mexico under pressure on the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scription of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders from Mexico and Australia were published by Washington Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on January 27th Tr@@ ump was requested in a phone with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ie@@ to , to publicly claim that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US president appe@@ aled him , because he publicly den@@ ounced the Wall . he said to him , &quot; You cannot say the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump launched its presidential campaign with the promise to set a wall on the southern border of the USA , and sw@@ amp , Mexico to pay for the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tran@@ scription of his first calling with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turn@@ it , were also released and dis@@ closed exchange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ key that trade for the US refugees that immig@@ rated to Australia , &quot; bad &quot; , &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; du@@ p &quot; would look like a &quot; de@@ p &quot; would have been suggested to ban refugees from refugees to the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call , after having said Mr. Turn@@ it , &quot; This is the most enjoyable call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford massacre : activists perform rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury launched by a group of spectators at the rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and shr@@ inks to the Ford Bridge of Moore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the car had four black passengers and a white driver , a group of white men stepped up with guns to block his way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ b - a man @-@ middle age in a needle retreat - took a long move at his cig@@ ar and looked after the wind@@ shield .
the in@@ mates moved in fear inside .
&quot; we want to Roger this n -@@ --- r Roger ! &quot; qu@@ ll@@ ing of the man .
&quot; get rid of the car ! &quot;
the silence fills the silence as a young black man captured from the passenger seat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , this awesome scene was played on July 22 , only a reproduction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger &quot; , almost all in the audience dis@@ gu@@ sted very real si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 people came back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com - and George and Mae Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - born by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever charged with the murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s really unc@@ anny that in all these years no one person was arrested , though we know who they are , &quot; says Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks who helps in organizing the night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a history but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sion@@ al member of the State of Georgia and a life long citizen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for him , the desc@@ endant serves as a dramatic call for action and presents an annual memory of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that a inj@@ us@@ tice has never been corrected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want the prosecution , we want healing , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to receive justice . &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we cannot get to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a court @-@ medi@@ cs puts a blanket on the cor@@ p@@ se of one of the victims of the Moore &apos;s Ford Lyn@@ n , on 27 July 1946 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to FB@@ I files , which were obtained by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected of the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but nobody was ever charged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the susp@@ ects remain on free foot for decades , citizens ri@@ ght@@ fully say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions have been known throughout the city : politics and sex . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court ruled the black people to Georgia for the first time to give her voice in advance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approximately at the same time as the choice st@@ ach following the FB@@ I of the black Far@@ mers Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - supposedly of a woman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ ors had slept in the city , that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby wore to her , not by her husband . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on July 25 , 1946 Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a famous white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com within the prison , so the FB@@ I . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and their cou@@ sins Mae Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when she was then removed from the prison , Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge came near , a ly@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared and arranged the k@@ illings , &quot; includes a FB@@ I report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecution that was not only involved in the murder , the evidence and the identity of witnesses were deceived . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks form@@ ulates it more pre@@ gn@@ ant .
&quot; it was a electoral law &quot; massacre . &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed in order to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you vote and tune , this will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for almost a decade Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has directed the annual production of the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her representation is vivid , moving and based on a kind of deep rac@@ ism , of which many believe that he no longer exists in America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to watch , and even more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that that is the point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch , because we will be confron@@ ted with the ug@@ ness in us all , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build your relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the samples for this year &apos;s production started in June , and the first day ended almost 30 actors - a dozen White and the rest of Black - in a room and listening to a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview about the piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ Director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he played the role of chief c@@ lan@@ mit@@ es for years , but he said , the roll never become easier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to get this story real , because we would not like to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand of the room the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ con@@ a played by Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester to play their lines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the high priest and ur@@ ged him to be angry with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I said that &apos; he was w@@ aving from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ con@@ a raises fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; asked Ras@@ con@@ a .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene said still po@@ ck@@ ling .
&quot; I simply don &apos;t believe that white people were back then &apos; n --- he &apos; said . &quot;
&quot; but &quot; wit@@ ching one of the other black actors .
&quot; you only have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s exactly the energy in space , a sense of camera body replaces the dis@@ comfort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone is busy to get this right , not just because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the scene begins once again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this time , when Ras@@ con@@ a says the N word , he says it sharply and with im@@ print . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nobody laugh@@ ing is laugh@@ ing .
this repeti@@ tion ends violent and fast .
there is sh@@ re@@ ie , shots and then silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one woman clothed with a wedding dress , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of actor and offers Che@@ ap Holidays praise &quot; St@@ range Fru@@ it &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks at every second word .
about a hundred metres behind it wi@@ pes out a group of about four dozens of spectators sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is divided almost evenly between black and white .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a pair is traveled from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come only down the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as , almost eight hours of Georgia , when Broo@@ ks got her on a pilgrimage to the bur@@ ial sites of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until this point the mur@@ ders have remained an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one had found on the same country where the ly@@ n@@ k@@ illings did , the air feels sp@@ oo@@ ky . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the final notes of the songs sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the body name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
children sit at their heads and record the f@@ ake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per@@ ing each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , mur@@ m@@ urs a little boy , as if he remind them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks to the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ x rope and wi@@ pe her tears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit who has played the C@@ lan@@ o .
Nick Ras@@ con@@ a embra@@ ces two of his players and then breaks out in their arms , the emotional bur@@ dens of the performance finally breaks through him .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; whis@@ pers one of women .
&quot; we know that it is not in your heart .
you did this for a reason . &quot;
later the audience put together with actors as a dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a table , a white pair of Atlanta reli@@ eves over the reproduction with a black pair which they just got to know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was fighting words to find words , which has left the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these horri@@ ble words and deeds ... to come from people who look like you yourself and what they do like you , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what that really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ch is still going on , &quot; she said , &quot; today the only police shooting is called &quot; police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone broo@@ ks Farm at his table he e@@ ats and reminds of the Ci@@ ti@@ zenship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , he already started planning the performance in the next year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reproduction is inspiring in some way , for it describes the hor@@ ror of what we endure , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s so if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who does not study his own history , who does not know his own history is condemned to repeat them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dä@@ mmerung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s mon@@ umental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf sets a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e production in front of gigantic , six @-@ storey back@@ drop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tor@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows an asp@@ ir@@ ated street corner with the Berlin Wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ d in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ine &quot; from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before , it par@@ ked an open Mercedes classic car in which the Rhine kills as rock@@ erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively a is@@ etta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
stacked o@@ ks remember Cast@@ or@@ fs leit@@ motif - money , power and gre@@ ed - that moves through his &quot; ring &quot; production .
the three banks of the Rhine - sung by Stephanie Hou@@ tz@@ eel the Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize how already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , they lead the Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ k ) , in Hollywood @-@ mania a body in the trunk and give the Kra@@ ret@@ o Cli@@ que . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephen M@@ illing sings the mar@@ vel@@ ous Hagen with that the aura of heav@@ y@@ weight .
brutal the scene when he Siegfried scar@@ ed .
later even Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) must also believe .
the audience thanks it with great appl@@ ause .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stor@@ my , Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski decided to de@@ fle@@ ct himself the hands of Merkel and Merkel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great appl@@ ause are available for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself for the first time on stage - in the face of the great heat and again in leg@@ or@@ less leisure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gig was eag@@ erly awa@@ ited with Frank Cast@@ orf and his team team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , he had to leave a H@@ ellen@@ ic wh@@ ist@@ le concert for himself in 2013 , there were five years later great it@@ ow@@ els in which the single @-@ added &quot; BU@@ H &quot; calls went down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ haus Katharina Wagner is looking forward to looking forward to this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note that the audience has grown together with the &quot; Ring &quot; in some way , &quot; she said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the audience did not only make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of its view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I draw a positive conclusion .
max amount works as a volunteer
they work in their voluntary year at several locations .
where everywhere ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amount : usually in Stein@@ furt in the furniture shop , once per week I will help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I worked at the school already in an open day .
how are your experiences with this ?
amount : it is a nice and broad spectrum that I see here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are now 26 years old so a late @-@ employed volunteer .
how does it come ?
amount : I made my secondary school .
and then we have studied civil engineering ; let &apos;s say successful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , I recognized that it is the wrong and I want to make something else to work with people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then I asked what you &apos;re doing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make a social year , there is an insight where you can see how it can be , in the focal point maybe , really . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and was it so ?
amount : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in social media in the winter semester .
I will study dual strength and probably do a social worker education in the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study at Ham@@ m at the university .
is it not unusual to have several different locations throughout the volunteer ?
quantity : yes it is very variable .
it &apos;s always getting closer to where you can see his FS@@ J .
one can make it from the ag@@ ull to youth work - in all sorts of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
that was exactly the right thing for me .
I could recognize and see my own strengths and see how it really expi@@ res .
is different compared to civil engineering ?
amount : so clear here it &apos;s not about to expect St@@ ati@@ ken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; again and again , there are other people above the head that have a completely different story behind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether a refugee or youth , a youth who has been taken out of the family - you must always go into it individually . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very interesting .
and you had no touch of contact ?
a lot : I &apos;m not the guy .
it is a area that gives a lot .
a lot of love , a lot of kindness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are also a negative moments , but that &apos;s how life is just . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ear@@ son k@@ gs further 3,000 jobs and will be shortened to revi@@ ve the business
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the British education group P@@ ear@@ son said on Friday , she will reduce further 3,000 jobs , while another restructuring programme will be started to overcome the pressure with which the company is confron@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the job loss , the General director John Fall@@ on mainly announced for late 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , which had already lost 4,000 jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ear@@ son announced in May in a third cost reduction program , a plan for cost reduction by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business which was hit through the fast step into digital study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company , which had expressed its participation in Pen@@ guin &apos;s Rand@@ om House on its partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the fiscal year remains unchanged at 2.@@ 05 billion pounds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
con@@ voy of Kabul : NATO civilian soldier killed in suicide attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a suicide bom@@ bed had attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afghan capital of Kabul , killed one troops and several others , say official . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; five soldiers , and an interpre@@ ter were injured , a declaration of Nato . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
un@@ confirmed local reports according to the incident in the district Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h died also three civilians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bombing has been the last violence that Afghanistan has taken this month - on Tuesday , more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ bed killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a position of NATO , it is called an explosion on Thursday night , when a common pat@@ rol with the Afghan army performed by an &quot; of people carried out impro@@ vised explo@@ sives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the testimony states that all injured in a stable condition are located , and in the US military hospital are treated at the air@@ field B@@ agram . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group is known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h ( IS ) is a big concern for NATO troops at the nearby B@@ agram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the United Nations estimates , in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , at least 1.@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths , of which about 20 % were in the capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in late July , a suicide @-@ motor@@ ised car slew at least 30 people in a prime district of Kabul . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Taliban said they had done this attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 31 May , a massive bom@@ b@@ ings in the centre of the city struck more than 150 people with the most fatal milit@@ ant attack of the country , since the Taliban in 2001 passed the power of power . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence emphas@@ ises the pre@@ ventive security situation in Afghanistan , since US President Donald Tr@@ ump stimulates the number of U.S. troops to support military and police in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ bers in Kabul in the last weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policy and especially to the reputation of President Ash@@ raf G@@ hani . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
EPA returns to delay the smo@@ g rule according to complaints
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US @-@ American Environment Agency has taken a decision to sim@@ ulate a regulation of the government of Obama , abol@@ ished that the states are obliged to em@@ ulate the smo@@ g causing borne emissions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday to advance the so @-@ called &quot; ozone @-@ ordin@@ ance 2015 , &quot; and said that they show the obligation of agency to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we react to our state partners , &quot; said EPA @-@ CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt announced the issue of the EPA to determine the ozone standards - in which part of the country &apos;s pollut@@ ant emissions must be established , in order to delay more str@@ ingent air quality standards - to delay a year until October 2018 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic countries , together with the District of Colombia , agreed on Tuesday , and said that the effort is illegal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump tried to imp@@ ose a broad range of environmental remedi@@ es which imposed on former President Barack Obama , as part of a wider agenda , to boost economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have triggered the recovery of the Democrats and nature groups that worry about the effects of greater emissions to public health . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA website says that the inhal@@ ation of air , containing ozone , can reduce the lung function and ampli@@ fy the respiratory symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
council wants common room
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , the decision was made clear : with two counter@@ voices the council of a joint venture for@@ wards the establishment of a common room in the future treas@@ ury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the missing land piece is signed is the Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ ades .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it will still take some time until the church population is still in possession of the church , but there is no planning for the project to be a private investor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a discussion in a common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of these two investors , who are still in the boat , is offered to meet the congregation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the ground floor he would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters of space for a special price .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the administration and majority of the council , such a common room does not fore@@ see as meeting point for residents of sen@@ i@@ or@@ ical living , but openly in the church . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an example the word &quot; Stri@@ ker Cafe &quot; made the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by doing so , the decision to be made by providing means for the current household in the last fall has been decided through funding opportunities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the construction is in the rehabilitation area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the establishment of a common room would be reported , T@@ j@@ ades is reported to promote 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision sees to show the investor , that if you have no b@@ ill@@ ets between the legs , the statement that stands on the surrounding areas - as well as p@@ ult@@ roof , which reduces the height and building more efficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
need@@ less but not only Wil@@ fried S@@ oh@@ mer is this addition .
when it helps : he unanim@@ ously passes the body .
it &apos;s not that easy in the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many own buildings , with which one will not move in so quite right now when the common room opens out of the window , she tells me : &quot; I do so hard with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal shar@@ ehol@@ ding .
she sees behind it a hidden subject of unexpected or even foreign investors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , because with the purchase of the area you don &apos;t give any subsi@@ dy , but get a true , in doubt that the opposite is to speak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sta@@ en@@ ant &apos;s request to s@@ lei@@ gh the decision shall be made according to three pro@@ pon@@ ents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of two counter@@ voices in the original programme , Stefan H@@ aller summar@@ ises : &quot; if we summar@@ ize the decision , we make a huge step back to close our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
coll@@ ision with car : Rad@@ ler is shot down on road
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while on the route of the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old rider was captured by a car and was severely injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the police , the 82 @-@ Year Langen@@ felder was on road by 12.@@ 20 with his bike on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer , coming from the road Hil@@ den . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the senior wanted to cross the road in height of the road to the Buch@@ hol@@ zer bush .
one in the same direction of driving passenger car driver gave him priority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the Langen@@ felder went down to the road , it was not evident on the return . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he joined a car together with a 66 @-@ year old H@@ ild@@ en@@ erin .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought into a hospital by ret@@ ou@@ sing .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for five defe@@ ats in the past six test games , An@@ cel@@ otti did the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was last not good . &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in the first official achievement of the season .
&quot; football is also tac@@ tics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the members want to set up the planned routes and inform them about stars and stars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first phase through 2018 , the association plans &quot; well @-@ reaching installations at five to six locations &quot; in the Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
question came in St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the boards will be supplemented by Internet .
this is why the site selection includes a good mobile network reception .
acces@@ sibility is a crit@@ erion .
later the star@@ path turn to be extended by train .
&quot; on star@@ pf@@ path the viewers learn a lot of knowledge about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they also lear@@ nt why stars had different colors , or why a star is stronger than another , although it is much further away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , in which constellation become a selected star and when it is best to see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been operating since 2014 in the mining town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg on the highest situated ob@@ servatory in northern Germany .
the site in the middle of the Harz National Park counts according to data from the Federal Office of Nature Conservation to the six dark regions in Germany .
often seen from there on the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galaxy with the naked eye .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2003 , in the Uni @-@ City , Planet@@ arium Göttingen has something similar to the planned star@@ ry - the planet &apos;s plan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
starting from H@@ har@@ ds Hotel in Go@@ e@@ the@@ alle@@ e which forms the inside of our solar system the planet runs with his camels up to H@@ ain@@ berg and to the ob@@ servatory - as well as an ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of the same ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the boards with individual planets - including the d@@ warf planet Plu@@ to at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and in a scale of one to two billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the earth shr@@ inks to a ball of 6,5 mm in diameter while the sun measures exactly 70 meters away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire distance of the planet is nearly four kilometers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the light takes about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the world .
the march to the next fixation would last a half year .
Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and V@@ asy@@ l Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o meet for the first time to discuss a possible show@@ down
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ asy@@ l Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia , who should be in a coll@@ ision course to produce the most exciting bo@@ asting in the near future at 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Boxing Council Ligh@@ weight @-@ Champion , the hall down to Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o , the World Boxing organization Super fe@@ ather weight champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Gar@@ ci@@ as victory through un@@ ison@@ o vote on the former Four Di@@ visions world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ ce on Saturday on Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched forth the right hand and said , &quot; How is this champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 19 : 00@@ pm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the pair of photos posed , Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Cli@@ ma noticed that a possible show@@ down among the fighters could be the &quot; perfect order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former spring weight &quot; remin@@ ded Gar@@ cia .
&quot; I &apos;ve gone up for bronze &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; but I &apos;m not so big .
I am small for 140 .
I want to get down to lightweight .
and he must move to a lightweight design &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that demands the fans .
let &apos;s give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this battle . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; climate was asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , in the next summer with Gar@@ cia to agree on a date ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also has an interest in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their lightweight covers in the forum on September 23 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this struggle could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ View mode because all the fans have asked for him , &quot; said Gar@@ cia and pressed later to fight at the network , which offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
when always they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said he reck@@ on Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and may possibly take part in his Saturday battle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o held a great praise for Gar@@ cia in a generous gift for Gar@@ cia , saying that he think the tri@@ fight champion from River@@ side is very slow , sorry Mik@@ ey ... you were willing to co @-@ off the Ko @-@ Off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said that the focus is to show impact strength , then boxes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they both said , they could feel the Mom@@ entum , which was built for their own battle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is the fight that must be performed .
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o said : &quot; I waited for the top fighters and this is Mik@@ ey .
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four verses after tyre plat@@ ter
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an accident on A7 , four people were injured on Thursday afternoon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the first information , the rider of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira was just lost from the junction for 16.@@ 30 minutes before connecting to a tyre plat@@ ter , the control over his vehicle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the passenger down@@ wards to the right into the vil@@ la@@ ins , where he pit@@ ched and then remained on the roof in the green stripes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the four passengers - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during initial provision by the ambul@@ ance service , the A7 was locked in the direction north for about an hour , then traffic on the left hand side was passing by an accident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fort@@ un@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; turning chain works better &quot;
Andre Hoffmann hopes to start the end of the season at 2 : 2 at the end of the season of Br@@ uns@@ wick to optimize the resistance formation in Au@@ e points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the season , Andre Hoffmann was pleased with the result , if not the two opponents were at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we must fit into au@@ e even better , &quot; says the def@@ ensive player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Erz@@ gebirge the thresh@@ ing chain should also be optimised further .
and a fool according to a fre@@ eway will also not lead to the un@@ am@@ ity anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , it will be like no more than Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) to the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his crew ent@@ ails even after the experiences in preparation with the Dre@@ mel chain , than with the four @-@ chain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how to act in au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure to have the half@@ way to Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko G@@ fo@@ el@@ mann who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a pre@@ condition , but that we are still better harmonious and we don &apos;t afford to realize a lot of off@@ ense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann also drives to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if one can &apos;t speak of a mis@@ sl@@ ated start , I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could indeed be quite okay . &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we stand on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the trop@@ hy , we will certainly be able to talk of a neat season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for that his trainer didn &apos;t want to know anything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start into the season I had only after six to eight game days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm radio , who would not like to speak of an advantage over an advantage , just because the game of Sax@@ ons had to be ab@@ orted too early because of a we@@ ather@@ proof . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season as a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e could perhaps be some fresh , as they would not have a serious and complete play as Fort@@ una against one asc@@ en@@ sion to the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know so 100 percent where they are currently standing , &quot; says the defender of the Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
guests from the Rhin@@ eland go to the Rhin@@ eland as an easier favorite on Sunday to meet at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we go away for it , just because we have the claim under the first six is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is absolutely positive with only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no crew in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , that you must hit from the out@@ set , &quot; explains Fort@@ un@@ as Chief coach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one such statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el doesn &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum application tests published
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden have under@@ gone that more than 80 per cent of the tested persons are older than 18 years , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swedish authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( Soviet St@@ alli@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has begun with performing tests last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should be more accurate during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish Migration Authority ( Mig@@ rant ) because of the evaluation of the correct age of some refugees was cri@@ tici@@ zed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , Mig@@ rational verk@@ et 6.@@ 880 was disp@@ at@@ ched and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of altogether 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid March to 31 July 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , that the person was &quot; probably 18 years or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion was that the person may be &quot; possibly under 18 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tests are carried out only in cases , where the person &apos;s age is challenged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Johan G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are durable over the past few months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; he said the journal The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the high proportion of cases , in which the person has been judged for more than 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers have lied over his age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May , the Agency released the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that it will give 4@@ 42 cases that the recommended person must be 18 years or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska Dag@@ bla@@ det , the 5@@ 81 published results found that in 243 of these cases the person had said that she will be 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some areas , the method of medical age assessment , X @-@ rays of white blood @-@ teeth and MRI scans that are analyzed by to@@ oth@@ s and radi@@ ologists was cri@@ tici@@ zed in some areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a scep@@ tic is the En@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus des Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work includes the assessment of biological maturity of humans to see whether they were earlier or later than pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t believe that the type of measuring should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge the biological age in this way is very un@@ secure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot say it safely , we should not do as if we could , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ ö@@ ran from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Commission , however , def@@ ected the accuracy of tests : &quot; generally you can say that the risk to judge a child as an adult in@@ correctly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest risk lies in when the person is under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full on the Plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ra@@ mberg is proce@@ eding well .
on Wednesday a seven tonnes of heavy concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very good in the time it runs great &quot; says Reinhold Lei@@ ca , building manager at the Department of Road and Traffic in the Government of Freiburg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in April , works began at all three re@@ aring bridges between Sch@@ ra@@ mberg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is intended for October and is safe to keep the timet@@ able .
the first bridge coming to Sch@@ ra@@ mberg is going across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ ault Bridge made of concrete which is coated with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the two other bridges , it has now come into the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to ensure the stability and safety of road safety the three buildings are thoroughly restored .
the two other bridges run through the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both were built in 1939 and twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 meters long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge at the town entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now on Wednesday morning on the northern side a 1.@@ 30 meters wide and seven tonnes heavy so @-@ called bri@@ dging paper@@ board .
this is a wall mount which is also used as an operating road .
on the southern part of the bridge a bridge of 2.@@ 20 meters should be inserted on Friday .
then the pedestrian wal@@ k@@ way should be run .
the special thing is that there are pre@@ judi@@ ces and a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge caps .
special finger@@ tips gave the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a glass fibre cable connected to which many companies connected .
local residents were informed about the project in the run @-@ up of the works .
furthermore Pis@@ ces and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be ab@@ sent .
for bridges between the building farm and the collectors towards Sch@@ ra@@ mberg is the traffic single @-@ lane by a traffic light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for construction on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ b@@ acher village entrance , the road is in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the three frac@@ tures should be at 700 000 Euro .
the whole is financed through the country .
AF@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under Protest in German potato salad
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it doesn &apos;t come so often that parties go on a strand , but when it comes to an alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is difficult to bring under a hat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the United States Parties ( CDU , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Lin@@ ke ) belong to a broad alliance with this day , because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ dell has been announced on a poster with great voting mechanism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and known names to the start brings - like Alice Wei@@ del , who will be the top duo for the parliament election on 24 September , and vice @-@ presi@@ dents of Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but those who are on @-@ site already hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ L@@ ans but demonstrate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colourful . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally the city was planned under the motto &quot; All on a table &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now on the parking below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus directly before the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a colourful picture that provides .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chairman of the Forums A World and one of the relevant organis@@ ers , really pleased : &quot; great how many people have gathered here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and plenty of food , including a &quot; ur@@ red potato salad , which also could eat the Af@@ D without problems , &quot; says the woman who brought him with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police ran@@ ds many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , and it is above all at the railway station , which is only a few meters away from the venues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes was reported by the Af@@ D volcanic cones that he tried to have such an event and get the supplement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 45 year old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had asked first in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already assembled Lau@@ ren@@ ti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes there was not enough parking available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a view of the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ é@@ court , he says : &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing and it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also does : at 20 o &apos;clock there is a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle diverse Red@@ ner , among them the rh@@ einf@@ land @-@ pe@@ eled Af@@ D @-@ President Uwe Young . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the hall some 200 listen@@ ers are waiting to see that the top candidate for the Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and vice @-@ presi@@ dents of Beat@@ rix by Stor@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police presence remained unchanged ; but until now the officials had a peaceful evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little more than an hour take the Af@@ D event , the guests on the court have a longer breathing , but also there is time after 21 clock premises . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police can get back - no special inci@@ dents .
trumpet meets trumpet
a re @-@ heard with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli there are in the series Has@@ la@@ cher monastery concerts tomorrow @-@ Sunday , at 20 o &apos;clock in the monastery church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert among the motto &quot; Black Sea &quot; meets Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ fol@@ klore &quot; meets a classic German education with roots in brass music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

so Pet@@ kov Sol@@ oist with the renowned concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both un@@ ites the lust of bl@@ ush the limits on their instruments , but also to merge the borders of different gen@@ res . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new garment , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; combines classic , jazz and jazz playing together with a fascinating entire art work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ils has written it especially for the two musicians , and is deliber@@ ately included in the concert with her special acou@@ sti@@ cs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; some people like grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
but I want to try out all things &quot; so Kri@@ sten Stewart completely openly about their bis@@ exu@@ ality .
&quot; when I contribute to grilled cheese I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; .
the probably best known relationship of Hollywood stars was the &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert Patt@@ in@@ son who ultimately went bitter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ er faced with the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love with anyone who I have prac@@ tised . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
or do you think about that I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten allowed to be bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I always lived and believed in du@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it never gets confused or ob@@ struc@@ ted .
I only liked it to be taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but especially those suffered from &quot; Bang Show@@ biz , &quot; but in school days , when they prefer to dress like a bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really hurt me very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I eleven , the children told me , I would look like a book . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really felt attacked and fri@@ ghtened and ashamed .
now I &apos;ll see and think : &apos; girl . be proud of you ! &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially the public , they don &apos;t like to love her love life : &quot; people expect you to form a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some op@@ ause for me , but I don &apos;t like it to jus@@ tify myself from all the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
governor of West Virginia announces that he alter@@ n@@ ates the Party
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tr@@ ump to change the party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; said Governor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you by many prayers and lots of re@@ thinking ... today I will tell you the inhabitants of West Virginia . I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in it@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; as a trainer I would say that it is time to play a different game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised a great announcement at the West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points ; and Justice did not accept the democratic Candi@@ date H@@ illary Clinton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Justice , according to For@@ bes of the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the State , was elected in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For@@ bes declar@@ es that he owns coal mine in five countries , and inher@@ ited from his father a coal shop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thursday night said a declaration in which it said : &quot; the party change of Governor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party that would rather be working towards us to make our country great again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 govern@@ ments and control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last re@@ jection of a party that is capable of finding a positive , puri@@ fying message , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ Chairman Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
co@@ E does &quot; honest &quot; Russian re@@ ap@@ ology for D@@ oping sc@@ andal
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world leader of the athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday , what he was as evident exc@@ use from Russia to a D@@ oping sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be absorbed into the sport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian athle@@ tics boss Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said during the World Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships that the exile of his country was correct and that he was determined to fight the d@@ oping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes who were swe@@ pt away for competitions gold and silver gold medals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted for maintaining the ban , which was transferred in November 2015 , after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) indications on nation@@ ally funded D@@ oping in Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the repor@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted with the Russian Federation , that she has experienced some pretty hot times and everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is also pleased that Russia would accept the criteria for its re@@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress was made , but the Congress endor@@ sed the recommendations of Task Force that did not stop Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation .
the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the with@@ ered system , &quot; he added
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will begin at the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships , which will start in London after the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral stak@@ eholders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said that Russia must meet some of the criteria for a re @-@ setting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dro@@ pped tests are still in@@ adequate and banned train@@ ers are still free , he said repor@@ ters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fun@@ eral of mour@@ ning for Mali
a mour@@ ning for a fun@@ eral service in F@@ ritz@@ lar have taken around 1000 people of the two with a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday at the Dom@@ stadt under high safety precau@@ tions .
for the even un@@ explained say@@ ings he said nothing to the defense minister Ursula from the Le@@ yen ( CDU ) .
she signed the two commented pilots but as &quot; expert of their staff . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow before this highest sacrifice which they have provided on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old principal and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Chief Executive Officer from Nord@@ h@@ essen had come alive on Wednesday a week in the West African Mali .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their volunteers were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a total guard of the soldiers in the F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ er Dom , St. Peter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at noon we took a farewell to the family members of the Church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; afterwards , the fun@@ eral service began in the family , close friends , from representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
among them were also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CDU ) and the Chief Executive Officer of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
grape harvesting rose ro@@ ses and the relatives stood on arm in arm at the se@@ ws .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the church , F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Minister of Defense from the Le@@ yen signed the comm@@ ited soldiers described as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and sat@@ anic .
the St@@ aup@@ t@@ mann had built the flight operations of the combat helicopter Tiger in F@@ ritz@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger drivers of his regim@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , Commander of the Regim@@ ent , said to whom the soldiers belong , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this crew could not turn the crash , nobody would have missed it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali the Minister from the Le@@ yen was not : the use is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he may also be of great importance for a country by which we are only separated by two states , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the fun@@ eral service , the po@@ orer from the cathedral were brought . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when and where they will be buried , the Bundes@@ wehr does not make any information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik doesn &apos;t want to be a grave next to his wife
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shared the Royal House on Thursday .
it is traditionally appointed Danish royal couple in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already built a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the Queen does not agree with the decision of her husband and it was continued in communication .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , be still un@@ clear .
but he did not intend to teach in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik never made a secret from it that he was not happy with his title .
he would be the King after the thr@@ iller of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 .
in 2016 he retired and also laying the title &quot; prin@@ er supp@@ er . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Hen@@ rik in Denmark didn &apos;t get the title and function he wanted to see himself compared to his wife , also not after death , explained the editor of the Danish royal house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will be finally still un@@ clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he did not intend to settle in his French home , but in Denmark . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he likes the land for which he has worked in the last 50 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the native Henri de Lab@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ ble@@ man , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Th@@ ames he worked in the French Embassy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during his later wife , Prince Hen@@ rik in his barely 50 @-@ year Reg@@ ent@@ ele had a heavy stand in the Dan@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a biography about the first few years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Danish was s@@ ank@@ end , I prefer wine instead of beer , silk scarf instead of kn@@ itting , Citro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , Tennis instead of soccer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia Tob@@ acco and which in this country , I could not hope for the mark of social intellec@@ tu@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not ashamed .
they were in two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Weil aims to promote rapid re@@ election
CDU and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dutch Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re@@ election of the country , but does not want to come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , the dis@@ solution of the Parliament said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , the surprising exit of a Green M@@ EPs from its land@@ fill in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; five months prior to the official date of the country @-@ parliamentary elections , the red @-@ green coalition lost one vote majority in parliament to the opposition from the CDU and F@@ DP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Green MP El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests , founded by the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 at its electoral district in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CDU , &quot; she declared in Hannover on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
CDU politi@@ cian Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler will recommend his faction to record it .
this means that the CDU and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Sax@@ on land day of the SPD and the Green 68 seats .
so far the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new Parliament will be voted on January 14th next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said , the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether to continue to go@@ vern in this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Weil believes it is essential for the reason that the Diet is rapidly resol@@ ute its self @-@ resolution as soon as possible .
the CDU faction is expected to decide on Tuesday through its further procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state , also , provides the opportunity to see the state day president for ministers and cho@@ oses a successor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; our Constitution provides several options .
these options must be legally checked and checked . &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler .
&quot; one will discuss all questions in peace when they are legally determined . &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called the West &apos;s step &quot; but something Kur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
the political press was stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she referred to as a tra@@ der of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the reb@@ elling dep@@ u@@ ties to the return of their country day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we conclude that she has received her country season with immediate effect , with immediate effect , distributed the presi@@ ding Meta Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner distributed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Group &apos;s presi@@ dents of the Green Anja PI@@ EL said : &quot; we regret the decision from El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests extra@@ ordin@@ arily . &quot;
it has decided not to lead any pron@@ unci@@ ation in the Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the background , that there were no content differences , we cannot trace this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the state of the lower Sax@@ on Green M@@ EPs El@@ ke T@@ est about the CDU as a betra@@ y@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behavior of the former Green M@@ EPs in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ y@@ al to the voters and voters , but also betra@@ y@@ al of Red @-@ Green . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) which is quickly new to choose the country day .
the withdrawal of the west@@ ward costs Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony in Lower Saxony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her past vanity and in her fru@@ stration , &quot; SPD Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Sal@@ vation is salvation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CDU in Nieders@@ achsen makes this dirty in@@ fil@@ en@@ ame and tries to beat its political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
low @-@ position CDU politi@@ cian Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler would recommend his MPs to CDU El@@ ke T@@ est into the CDU .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw the v@@ ests in front of their personal career as the result of the 2013 Parliament elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CDU during the SPD was strongest in force , the SPD and the green had a very thin majority of a voice in the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Agriculture of Agriculture in Interview - How do we protect ourselves from pois@@ oning , Mr Schmidt ?
Germany is discuss@@ ing more than p@@ seu@@ do@@ zed eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect the consumer .
agricultural Minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is an interview with the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) speech and reply .
Mr Schmidt : how can consumers protect the consumer from pois@@ oning eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers and consumers , to watch the eggs in your fridge and to check the st@@ amped pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ grocery war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de the Bundes@@ länder will present the latest information on the affected eggs .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if according to everything we currently know , a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does Al@@ di now take over the best potential crisis - all the eggs get out of the offer - because the central role of the awareness of the German Federal Minister isn &apos;t really perceived ?
the food surveillance is the role of the Länder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , my house was promptly switched on and since acquain@@ t@@ ance with public authorities in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
trade has the same as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are hard@@ working and harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if with eggs of the resi@@ due level of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg this is not accessible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however un@@ loaded eggs can be sold and consumed .
this is not the farms to blame .
are production plants and consumers in the same boat ?
the manufacturing organisation is no immediate fault after the line analysis .
they must first count on due to alleged illegal practices of service companies with economic damages .
as always there is too little control in the harvest .
is it missing only on the staff or even at the conclu@@ sive competence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , they have just been the official controls which have revealed the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , for truth , food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just for this reason why are a consequ@@ ent expl@@ aining such events , and the commit to the public authorities in the cases where crimin@@ ates may have received , of decisive importance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have made many times more clearly that by the responsible Auth@@ orities I expect a complete dis@@ en@@ lighten@@ ment .
is the regular alarm system really necessary at food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get safe and traffic @-@ ready food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide , which is used in the food industry , consumers and consumers have the right to be emp@@ tied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; manufacturers , merchants and consumers get into a situation which are absolutely not necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fundament@@ ally , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il for the post@@ ure of living @-@ safe animals is not acceptable and must be terminated promptly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be consistent on all planes and worked with high pressure .
I expect from all relevant authorities that the atomic fact is quickly solved .
how to finance the rules of the football at N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rules that aim to prevent un@@ hin@@ dered expenses of European football clubs , N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s World Record Transfer from Spanish Barcelona to Saint Germain will not dis@@ rupt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEFA , as the guiding organisation that monitors the European game has managed to forbi@@ d teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial Fair Play rules , created in 2011 by the UEFA EURO , mean that PS@@ G has to prove that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without great losses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Barcelona has paid 222 million Euros ( 262 million dollars ) in order to buy the Brazilian ans from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will be several ten million dollars a year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moves to France .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PS@@ G can easily make the money loose , so N@@ ey@@ mar under@@ goes and bring him into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energy rich rulers of Qatar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you may apply a lot of money to purchase players , but need to control the break @-@ even point in her on the soccer @-@ related business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FF@@ P was conceived by Michel Plat@@ ini following his election to the UEFA President , in 2007 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former French player believed that in their pursu@@ it had taken enormous debts to success , effectively dec@@ eive , and ris@@ ked to ru@@ in when banks or owner moved their support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P led to the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the change meant that the business model that bought the novel Abra@@ mo@@ vich originally 2003 in Chelsea , buying up a club with potential and build up a global brand - to become a hard case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P reference period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses of 30 million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and even though Plat@@ ini &apos;s presidency has fallen in 2015 by the presidency , his UEFA successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ ment continues to sit down at excessive expenditure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certainly is FF@@ P not dead and we will step further strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so who is responsible for the UEFA Press Press , last week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause from N@@ ey@@ mar in a l@@ ump sum , it may distribute the amount for billing over the duration of the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year agreement , so that the expenses for the next five years can be reported in the financial statements for the next five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 combined with Abu Dhabi , which is in possession of Manchester City , meets the hard@@ est sanctions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PS@@ G received a fine of € 60 million ( at that time , 82 million dollars ) , which later was estimated at 20 million euros for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season instead of ordinary 25 players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UEFA is looking for clubs which might attempt to sur@@ pass their financial view , announ@@ cing her revenue by companies that are associated with owners of a club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while a cat@@ ar@@ act company may imp@@ ose PS@@ G , if the value of the sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard marking , the UEFA would not be regarded as legitimate earnings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was exactly what happened in 2014 , when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsor@@ ing of the PSA of Qatar was blown up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was reported that a part of PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could be made by the Organ@@ izing Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but PS@@ G and Qatar for 2022 , that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s World Ambassador will be to be straightforward and simply to find such a maneu@@ ver for the UEFA regul@@ ators authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the previous sanctions on PS@@ G mean that the UEFA EURO might be more thou@@ ght@@ ful , every attempt to be aware of the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UEFA had no prepared discussions with PS@@ G on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , said the people familiar with the situation on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they spoke with the condition of the anony@@ m@@ ity to The Associated Press , as they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with sales of 54@@ 2.4 million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accounts for the last financial year must be published still .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s is a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot purchases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the club runs from it , that sales will rise at least 30 percent after the signing of the signature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Spanish league was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players to see , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s claim that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear event of &quot; financial d@@ oping &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Cat@@ ars the current owner of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arsenal @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e W@@ enger , whose association is owned by an American sport @-@ ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservation of La League against a state which is financed by a club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has changed the entire scenery of the football in the last 15 years , &quot; said W@@ enger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as a country has a club everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair Fair@@ play , because one has different ways or different interests , if a country has such a great actor in order to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new scra@@ per supplier
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has produced chocolate for Swiss Life .
now the local cooperation is facing a possible end : the airline is re@@ writing the order .
Swiss speaking team Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed a report on request by the News Agency S@@ DA on request of the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schwei@@ z &quot; on request .
according to the current planning the airline will close a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products are checked every two to three years and undergo quality control .
&quot; with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y we are very pleased &quot; &quot; said the speaker .
some 17 million small red @-@ red packaging boards will distribute to 14 gram per year to the flight att@@ endant to the passengers .
the Swiss Life didn &apos;t want to make any information about the cost .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; industry sector appreci@@ ates the volume volume according to &quot; Nor@@ thwest &quot; to 1.5 @-@ 2 million Swiss francs - Mig@@ ros subsidiary gains annual turnover of approximately 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : for a chocolate manufacturer it is a prestigious job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as many candidates are available for the new call , the Swiss won &apos;t show up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but only Swiss manufacturers come in question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the newspaper , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to repair a renewal of the Treaty by 2018 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer has not been available to support the S@@ DA for a comment .
chocolate bars distributed the Swiss since 2006 on board of their flights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the Swiss graduated with Mig@@ ros Dau@@ gh@@ ter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has supplied the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opportunity to place the logo , contributed two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ h@@ aul flights the customers of the First Class with treats will be spo@@ ilt from the business class nas@@ chen passengers ch@@ og@@ gi von Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi from Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also on the short route , Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi from Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and Economy Class . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

nostal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this repeti@@ tion of history is also nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the 80 @-@ s @-@ Gr@@ unge @-@ era ( as the pione@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ age , as Elizabeth B@@ anks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went for greater things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a cultural arti@@ fact it is equally a par@@ ody and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era of permanent memories .
but the fran@@ chise feels like the time quite scar@@ ce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; First Day of Camp &quot; was surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd hum@@ our ( it contained a original story for a talking can of vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by playing on the core of the G@@ ags - actors middle ages play strong children , who are growing - nevertheless they create the impos@@ sibility of winning the last part of the wid@@ get . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who play now is less emotion@@ ally rooted and its par@@ ody draws more after the wat@@ ering principle of 90 @-@ s , like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( &quot; The Hand that cra@@ dle the cra@@ dle &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a point , a character carries a character by an Apple Power@@ book , some In@@ line Sk@@ ates and &quot; a series of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gracious Coo@@ p ( Mr. Show@@ age ) is now not forgotten as Roman@@ aut@@ or . she is still not forgotten by K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mo@@ reau ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) is still not lost its vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy @-@ like plot that Ronald Re@@ agan is also involved with Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ ages ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always the ex@@ rates are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
it makes a lot of fun to see the et@@ ern@@ ally young Mr. Rud@@ d . the former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy is now showing how an old cra@@ cker feels like .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are the moments of acci@@ dental ma@@ dness , that could fuel this fran@@ chise : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene I will show the gang &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon has now remin@@ is@@ cent of a different type of nostal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans &quot; and even on &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its East @-@ West Ring@@ combat @-@ I@@ con@@ ography .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the com@@ edy by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka responded as a director : a Romanian drama of eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who struggle for truth , ath@@ e@@ ism and the way of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the star@@ ring - a hard @-@ car@@ bure@@ er Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i and their dialog@@ s of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon has been syn@@ ced in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it &apos;s not much more than an idea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are some nice g@@ ags to see ( the police take time to watch chess in TV , as Americans may do with football ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the list of famous speakers - among them Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Chlo@@ e Sev@@ ign@@ y - ensures a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de the voice out &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective , &quot; is so very committed to tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desper@@ ate propaganda bear - a mur@@ derer that plays a Re@@ agan mask , is involved as a single one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for six long episodes , the com@@ edy leaves away , and the com@@ edy is not quick or frequently enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective , &quot; which was reduced to a lower length , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef is always able to visit the American message whose lobby is always covered by two big men who had a pile of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the imag@@ inary public , imag@@ inary public , is that Western culture can make everything food for money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fic@@ ti@@ tious gene@@ alog@@ ist was not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history , and with the ih@@ ann@@ ess . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blow against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police had a blow against the Italian Mafia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday morning , in the Black Forest district , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Con@@ stance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart were searched for numerous objects , such as the public pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ors on Friday afternoon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the age of 25 and 77 , arrest warran@@ ts and had already issued warran@@ ts against them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , officials appointed larger quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , and several hundred thousand Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two persons were arrested for the same time in Italy .
against the two susp@@ ects Italian there were German warran@@ ts .
the two will therefore be shipped to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the event .
more than 300 police officers were in use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the members of the Mafia is accused of drug crimin@@ ality , severe violence , attemp@@ ted murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and ex@@ tor@@ tion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the public pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ors are determined by the organised drug traff@@ icking in southern Germany for the summer of 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between the districts of Kon@@ stanz and Palermo , a lively exchange and investig@@ ator of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore the large employment was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the vis@@ h@@ one of the studies , Italian citizens were mainly referring to Italian ma@@ fia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even a incident on May 27 , at the beginning , several shots were fired in a restaurant at the morning , should go to the bank account of the gang . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you compl@@ ain large g@@ aps in the Fore@@ ig@@ ner tab
&quot; data from citizens who should not dive : &quot; according to a report the foreig@@ ner Registry in Germany has considerable fla@@ ws in Germany .
this is a part of gra@@ v@@ ying patches with mis@@ use in asylum procedures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commissioner for Refu@@ gee Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has made a media report attri@@ but@@ able to major g@@ aps in the foreign commercial register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lack of defects relating to registered data may result in asylum procedures and dep@@ or@@ tations &quot; in a partial manner in analysis , which is presented by the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Registry , tens of millions of people with foreign citizenship have collected , including 5.5 million people from non @-@ EU countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the data is therefore managed by approximately 600 foreigners in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the data has not been kept sufficient , the data quality in parts did not have been well kept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in isolated cases data from 1921 was found , &quot; by people who are long forgotten to life , or of citizens who are , and in the Registry should actually no longer appear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; incorrect data entries can significantly slow back processes . &quot; it is said to the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the statistics on foreign people , the EU citizens are cap@@ tures that wouldn &apos;t have had to travel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but such false assur@@ ances led however &quot; to a distor@@ ted debate on how to deal with trav@@ ellers &apos; ways , it is therefore in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government has obviously begun to return refugee families with children under 16 years old when they returned from there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this emerged from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( B@@ AM@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the paper , it is said that B@@ AM@@ F is named such procedures &quot; regarding families with children , with the exception of infants and infants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the paper among reference to the difficult situation on site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Dublin Agreement , the EU state is responsible for refugees from the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can return it back into the travel destination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the reason I write the post : &quot; meanwhile , the capacity for families with minor children increased considerably in Italy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy have provided for the reception and accommodation for family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) hold this commitment to sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees from the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the domestic political speech in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , cri@@ tici@@ zed this decision : &quot; families with children are un@@ lawful for defects in the Italian asylum system &quot; adverse events and end@@ an@@ gering of child consciousness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 liters of blood produced in Ober@@ pf@@ chen@@ bach already provided us for other people .
at least from the twelve men who were awarded on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; above all Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has meanwhile shared 100 litres of blood with their now 100 donations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditionally , the community celebrates multiple will@@ ingness to don@@ ate blood into the meeting of the council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is awesome , as our body is created for it and we make the bra@@ ces for strangers which their blood is available for foreigners , to be served as mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood don@@ ating helps several people &quot; explained by the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , as the c@@ anned foods are destroyed in their components . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so many people could benefit from a blood don@@ ating .
at the same time maize blo@@ wers reported from the actions that are carried out in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach in the spring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; said the DRC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the change in the@@ atri@@ um had led to higher numbers of participants only a few years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before that Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Susanne Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Meta von Stra@@ w@@ berry to the Multi@@ Systems and were awarded for 50 performed blood donations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half as many were able to book Herbert M@@ air and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter ten times per 500 milli@@ liters of their habitat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England will probably announce that interest rates remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation settled over an increase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it maintained interest rates on family income in the middle of a reinforced pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the political decision makers of the Bank Committee ( M@@ PC ) agreed with 6 to 2 for taking interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase in this month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in its quar@@ terly forecast report , the Bank revised its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 , that the pressure on the household income would continue to rise to almost 3 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it sign@@ alised that during the next few years , interest rate would be necessary to breed inflation and said that the credit card would possibly have to rise more than expected in the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the members also voted to reti@@ re part of the Mamm@@ ut business package , which was published a year before the Bre@@ xit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will require time to demand for banks in order to provide cheap financial resources for banks from the next February , she is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - at 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the rate of interest , the bank said : &quot; in the central progn@@ osis of the M@@ PC , GDP will remain weak at short notice , as pressure on the real income of households will continue to consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through interest rates it repeated that &quot; a certain extent of monetary policy &quot; is required for cooling the inflation and a &quot; greater greater extent , than the markets expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets currently anticip@@ ate the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another year 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases &quot; gradually &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank forecast down@@ ward growth forecast down@@ ward for this and next year are in comparison to those in May , 1.9 % and 1.7 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has retained its growth forecast on 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these news from the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision to no change comes after the most dis@@ appo@@ inting growth , increasing increasing expectations of a rate of interest and increased GDP in the second quarter from 0.2 % to 0.3 % in the previous three months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will easily recover after the Bank at the end of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the youngest of the In@@ fir@@ ing Report offered little enthusiasm for households , which will be affected by rising inflation and slight up@@ time hearing before they become better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy in the next few years does not stop the income of income , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is attri@@ but@@ able to weak pounds , resulting in a portion of lower consumer expenditure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision will be made a year after lowering the interest rates on 0.@@ 25 % in August , following the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the sin@@ king &apos;s sin@@ king . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank estimates that it will last for four years , until this will reach the prices and the economy completely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the final judgement of the Bank on interest rates , the call increased to an interest rate because inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ ur@@ ged households , with three policy makers in July increase to 0.5 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inflation declined by 2.6 % in June last month , although the bank said that this was expected and put it on in the coming months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bank said , the crossing in relation to their target of 2 % was to be attributed to the weak pounds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mort@@ gage market looks more competitive again , because the len@@ ders are looking very competitive to shops and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the market looks particularly well for those who close existing deals and close the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with its free options and low rates are becoming more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is to prescri@@ be HIV drug 10.000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients will be con@@ ferred to a &quot; trans@@ forma@@ tive &quot; HIV prevention treatment in September after a fight against the financing of the drug in N@@ HS , after a fight against the financing of the drug in N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ HS England announced that a pre @-@ posi@@ tional pre@@ posi@@ tional phra@@ se ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection at approximately 86 percent , is now supplied by the health service at an initial three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he agreed to finance the trial , after the Court of App@@ eal confirmed a judgment of the Supreme Court , after confirming that the local Auth@@ orities ought to finance him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chess Federation announced on Thursday was received by N@@ HS England boss Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention &quot; , during the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual health clinic in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to follow the registration of people , and further clinics will be introduced in October 2018 it will be introduced all over England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pre@@ posi@@ tional phra@@ se ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV drugs that are taken before having sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that the EP was significantly reduced in the HIV transmission at risk of infection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ EP , before sexual intercourse , means that just enough medicines in the body of a person are present to prevent HIV infection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
such medicines may be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to those who come for the treatment , gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV positive partners , who were not successfully treated successfully . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are suitable candidates that identify the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have not known an anti @-@ known HIV status by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who live in England and are registered in a GP , can also register for possible participation in their local participating dental clinic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the program will signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England , signed a contract for delivery of the medicines this week after an international competitive procurement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the study is supposed to assess the entire potential of Pr@@ EP , applying in a large scale , implemented and implemented in a large scale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stev@@ ens said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention &quot; should supplement the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts towards the prevention of HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is another milestone in which more than three decades of ongoing progress in managing one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
Deb@@ orah gold , Chief Executive with NAT ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ EP , when targeted towards vulner@@ able and endangered people , offers the possibility to change the English HIV epidemic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from September to people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument , which is really individually controlled , and not with a partner to improve many , many lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we welcome you very warmly . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , CEO of Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , since the Pr@@ EP @-@ test medicine was pro@@ filed , we are on the best way to protect more than 10.000 HIV infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on Hodg@@ son , shadow @-@ health Minister , said : &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ating implementation by the government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the evidence show how trans@@ forma@@ tiv show this drug as part of our approach to HIV prevention , and can end the transfer of this life @-@ changing infection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is as fast as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that it will contribute closer to the end of the dissemin@@ ation of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the great life live : mezzanine and clever designers have transformed this small Ear@@ ls Court flat into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh : a former bank worker with a passion for real estate and shr@@ inking in 2014 by a large house in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is a evidence of the new design , that Jo@@ anne hasn &apos;t packed and sold her bags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; before I lived with my Ex in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger space &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I searched for something that was comparable to my price .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I fell in love with them and made an offer on this day . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square meters of the apartment was completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally a one @-@ bedroom estate with a covered layout , one had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom -@@ wanted to use Jo@@ anne Stau@@ ber and a mezzanine to use the spacious ceiling height . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I wanted to make high ceilings , large windows and plenty of light .
that was my requirement . &quot; she says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this purpose , they assigned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill to benefit from creating a home , but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ceiling was not great enough to place two rooms to each other , so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine with which you could stand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Er@@ fan had to be creative to solve the bill .
&quot; the steel piece is quite complicated . &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked together , without having to g@@ aps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but to put in steel that he had the right height above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement makes it possible to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine look down a classical copper @-@ light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us above the glam@@ orous living area .
mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
mirrors of mirrors play a role when adding theatre , space and light .
a short corridor is mir@@ ro@@ red at both ends to work for longer .
in the kitchen the mir@@ r@@ oring system feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance you can offer pi@@ ed units space for all the items and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the perception of a glam@@ orous space , the beauty of the living room can exclu@@ de the kitchen , if it is not used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
folding kitchens are nothing new .
so special about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little engineer went inside , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is mutual , so that when you slide the door , it is very easy gli@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to the smart use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could generate additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and improved layout . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day , you will sell the base area - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mental form a real estate agent will enter and carry out a calculation based on the ground size . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , they have managed to enlarge the ground surface and use high @-@ quality materials to gain the space his luxurious advantage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things they touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not love yourself into the electrical outlets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are important but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it shows that an apartment itself can transform itself through good design and increased square meters of something standard , into something really amazing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
brothers fight for an investment of 500 million US dollars
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the Dy@@ nasty , in a conflict due to one of the largest real estate , Vict@@ ori@@ as , worth over $ 500 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton football club &apos; and developer Colin De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , who has brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how their property and their assets will be divided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from a family company since 2014 , but a sharp debate on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers managed 38 properties in worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family purchased a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the family West@@ co Je@@ ans founded there and grew up to a chain of 160 individual retail stores .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis is now covered by Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the subur@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after an agreement with her de@@ ceased father , Colin J. - by Paul as &quot; principal operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - roughly two @-@ thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul is about a third . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a for@@ ter@@ file says that Colin property has the value of 316 million dollars and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the allocation of property and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans made by Colin proposed , and left him with what I kept for the best objects , &quot; wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last Friday , after several failed investigations took place the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brothers now fight for control of the existing business - from which Colin , as Paul claims that I have excluded him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she argu@@ ed , that this was not true , but throws Paul before , to manage some land@@ ings in@@ competent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an early aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it that was made by Colin , he , he , hoping to join the dispute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the costs are in the case , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher partners and Charter craw@@ lers , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and held from both sides . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants that were operated in the late 1950 @-@ s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood song , in which Colin opened the first je@@ un@@ cle of the family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Colin says that he began in the last years in the High School , when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , were committed to transfer their property to their sons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi said many times to me , that he never wanted to land the brothers in front of judgment , &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , with Colin claim@@ ing that Mark was paid for 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , thus Paul says , &quot; through the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Colin went very well , even though he was a former AF@@ L @-@ board member and after a biography from Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ire &apos;s best friend of television stars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Colin and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only Colin responded by SMS to say &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; because the case before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very , very sad , that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and to draw our family name through the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of 2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfil the demands of his brother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father did not wish that Paul and I would end up in our current dispute , &quot; he said , &quot; he was still hoping for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our matter will be solved by the courts in the near future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump of Head of Staff is planning to limit the media abst@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so it will be the first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restri@@ ct the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including the reports of the news media , in the hope of keeping the boss on an even higher course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here is a piece of repor@@ ter Jos@@ h Daw@@ sey :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as John F. Kelly , Head of Staff of the White House , he put a main problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps White House to repair it : poor information that fall into the hands of the President . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kelly did the staff to flow more about him - whether on paper or brief@@ ings , because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ apping dr@@ ums@@ y by monitor his medication .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tr@@ ump Relationship for TV goes back to decades - and now , when he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if candidate Tr@@ ump was anno@@ yed because of un@@ fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he had received a fair coverage of jobs , said the former election counsel Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote in the time that &quot; the key , Tr@@ ump Twitter hab@@ it consists of control to ensure that his personal media consumption involves an ongoing praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ ump &apos;s Twitter custom ever &quot; was under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
perhaps these combat officers know something that we do not know - that Tr@@ ump twe@@ ets should contain any more combus@@ tible material or her interventions .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that dump is not sent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if his employees manage to keep it away several times , trouble from him , their efforts have paid off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but no one has consistently abol@@ ish that Tr@@ ump contro@@ versi@@ es exc@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; part of the problem exists that people in a White House that places oneself from competing parties , will always try to present their own agenda by giving Tr@@ ump material , which may fo@@ sters their views from the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Poli@@ tico - totally with this story deals - in May about the pre@@ ference of advis@@ ors , to medi@@ ate the President for strategic reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was an example described by repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump can respond to negative press sections , especially those with embar@@ rass@@ ing Lec@@ ks , and to find out where they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exactly this happened at the end of February , when someone accused the president of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet Pro@@ v@@ ok@@ at@@ eur Charles C Johnson , &quot; the source behind a pile of his le@@ aks &quot; at the White House . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Johnson was banned from Twitter without any further evidence , or that he has no evidence of evidence in the past and vo@@ ke it to the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump read the article and began to en@@ quire about Wal@@ sh members . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added that the Head of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system in order to record and document the paper@@ work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps he will prove themselves as effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his counsel@@ ors are still under influence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these un@@ changing factors make cell@@ ars mission very difficult .
power requested crimin@@ als get post from Euro@@ pol
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the address is unknown , the aid of the population is praying and hop@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this summer , the police are sent out in this summer ( virtual ) postcards on dangerous crimin@@ als on the run . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the addresses of the requested sword crimin@@ als are not known , the critics are hop@@ ed and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday of the promotion starting to the &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; Advent calendar from Winter .
the experiences would have shown that many volati@@ le holiday destinations are conc@@ e@@ aled from the position of Euro@@ pol .
I have compiled 21 postcards for requested crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted to wanted more than 2.5 million times .
36 of the online staff could have been arrested so far and at least eleven of them have been published on the website .
travelers negoti@@ ate over a dit@@ ch and return back to the &apos; million@@ aire series &apos;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home owners of the West Mid@@ lands are again tra@@ ded with some un@@ determined trav@@ ellers on mar@@ gins , which have tra@@ ded a field before their manor buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the passengers have par@@ ked their 20 caravans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous street from Soli@@ hull , called &quot; the &quot; million@@ aire @-@ series . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they brought horses , babies and an army of transports , after being thrown out of the Council , without being deter@@ red by one of the Council out of being deter@@ red by the Council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the intact group found a gap in the defence facilities and pushed all their cars through a section , which remained un@@ ob@@ struc@@ ted to find a way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ra@@ mp@@ ant inhabitants have driven the council of Soli@@ hull , who said that it was useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; they went on Monday evening , after having been sent to Bentley He@@ ath , where they were thrown onto the Pass@@ anten . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced by shame to implement in fact , because it was useless to dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the passengers were in May there and were res@@ umed and are now back again .
more came yesterday evening and probably still more . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; the council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it , in order to protect their parks for a long time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I live at Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to keep my people paying off , if the Council cannot stop this once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a local people who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; it is ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last round of these travelers to be lo@@ oted only by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have increased this time , and even has seen a horse in the park range . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Spe@@ aker of the Council of Soli@@ hull said , &quot; We are conscious of an un@@ authorized camp in the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road . we take the necessary legal steps , so that they can move as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to support our evidence , it is very important that as many local residents announce a anti @-@ social or criminal conduct in the police by calling 101 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation , in which the judgment must examine when we submit our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is located .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ st@@ ad@@ ts is currently being renovated , and shall be re@@ opened on 1 March next year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is good news for the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because with the closure of the hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the former ambience of Sav@@ an@@ enhof , some 30 000 nights per year were lost and proceeds from the tourist tax . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the fall of 2014 , the numbers of refugees that came to the District of the county was offered as a collective accommodation in the hotel building as a collective accommodation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city prevented the placing of asylum seek@@ ers by the deployment of a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the council .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but above all , Fre@@ dri@@ st@@ ad@@ ts Ober@@ mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel site , saying back then to the prosp@@ ective buyer in the house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he should keep right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with managing director Birgit Sch@@ erer with seat in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a home of the three @-@ star class category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the Group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter facility .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Hon@@ al@@ b .
hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the earlier Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof there are long time building container front of the entrance , and when one enters the house , the extensive renov@@ ations will be performed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the floors were pulled out , covers partly disman@@ tled , remove old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is much to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a nice place &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rooms are equipped with large heated showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything should be &quot; nice &quot; later , &quot; how Thomas Sch@@ erer is pressed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make a gem out . &quot;
swimming pool , spa area and a meeting room are among the equipment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t have to position on the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at a higher centre level , empha@@ sizes sh@@ erer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lu@@ ise &apos;s Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its approximately 60 rooms , spread wide , explains nothing more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both single travelers and groups or business people will feel at home in the hotel .
convers@@ ations with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael K@@ rau@@ se he already led to Sh@@ erer .
the performances of the city are identical with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
according to the amount of investments Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to determine precisely .
just under a million euros he reck@@ ons .
outside plants are also brought onto the front man - this is clearly visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a courtyard , a large terrace , which is open to the restaurant , will be open to public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ air : U.S. special investig@@ ator sets a Grand Jury
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Russia @-@ Aff@@ air around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , an investig@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller is supposed to be a so @-@ called Grand Jury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the panel was working over the past few weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; on appeal to the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the newspaper adverti@@ se the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded and strengthened its investigations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CN@@ N transmitter reported , there are already first invitation of the body in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ umps and a Russian lawyers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
us secret services accused the Kre@@ m@@ lin have been blame for the presidential election campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller studied whether there were dis@@ agreements between Tr@@ umps and Moscow .
in the focus of investigations several men are supposed to be represented in the election campaign as a consultant of the Republi@@ can .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller took more and more tr@@ umps and business environment under the micro@@ scope . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Washington Post &quot; wrote some weeks ago that the Special Fac@@ ilit@@ ator Tr@@ ump to the Center and I &apos;m looking for the accus@@ ation , whether the president could not hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main task of Grand Jud@@ ys is to prove and decide whether the accus@@ ation is collected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Grand Law@@ ys are therefore also called purchase chambers .
mostly they are switched on if there are larger and controversial cases .
the process is always closed behind closed doors .
the panel can also be switched on by the Public Prosecutor to re@@ charge people for hearing under E@@ id .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to CN@@ N , pre @-@ inv@@ it@@ ations were issued to turn around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persons , who were involved in the meetings , were asked to be a statement , it was in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should also provide documents with them .
next to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. were also Tr@@ ump co@@ uns@@ ellor and Schwi@@ eg@@ ers@@ ohn Jar@@ ed K@@ ush@@ ner and his highest parliamentary vote Paul Man@@ a@@ fort in the interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday night , right @-@ wing experts told us that Mu@@ eller should not be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that he should be necessary quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it would not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end to decide on the survey of an accus@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the suspension of the body is at the beginning of a new phase into investigations and a new reason to concern for President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the president on Thursday night took a speech in West Virginia to represent Russia &apos;s aff@@ air as a campaign against his political opponents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Russia history is a total invention . &quot; Tr@@ ump said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the subject give the Democrats a way to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special counsel T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a position he knew nothing of the en@@ forcement of a Grand Jury .
but this usually work indo@@ ors as well . he empha@@ sized .
the White House offers all the measures that ex@@ pedi@@ ted the work of the specialist in a fair . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former FB@@ I CEO James Com@@ ey have said three times , that I will not be determined by the President . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one has no reason to accept that something changed , it was stated in the explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mu@@ eller was first used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey was fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this retirement , accus@@ ations were no@@ isy especially according to that he would like to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ ey said in June in front of a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him for a setting of investigations against the then national security advis@@ ors Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the president is on large printing because of the investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after representation of US media , the White House collected material against the agents and his employees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this triggered spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller could be released .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other than an independent investig@@ ator of Congress in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate aff@@ air around the later re@@ ten@@ tious President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller could have fired a position that he could theore@@ tically be fired by the President of the Ministry of Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several transm@@ it@@ ators of both parties intend to prevent such a step forward .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two groups of rep@@ ubli@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators ordered on Thursday , after which the special investig@@ ator could not be dis@@ missed either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Antarc@@ tica : gigantic Eis@@ berg drives in the Antarc@@ tic
in the West@@ ant@@ arc@@ tis a gigantic Eis@@ berg was dissolved by the Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is on the seventh size of Berlin .
it shared the Zar@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener @-@ Institut for Polar@@ - and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the col@@ oss driven over a trillion tons are now hit north and probably become two , three years , until it melted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers one of the largest ice @-@ gi@@ ants , the researchers have registered in the past three decades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not a danger for humans does not go out of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to what extent is climate change played a role in the crash of the ice@@ berg , is un@@ clear after research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , since approximately 30 years has been a series of unusual inter@@ fer@@ es in the region , writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( NS@@ IDC ) in a fac@@ simile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to many scientists this could be connected with global warming .
so far the broken Kol@@ oss was a part of Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
she@@ el@@ fe@@ is flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by big gl@@ ac@@ iers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks off regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is lies south of South America almost at the top of the ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula .
North of this retreat was the equilibrium of wa@@ xing and breaking off a few years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AW@@ I @-@ researcher , Daniela Jan@@ sen , writes a complete Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot to say that also the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is was in danger , as the front edge has never moved so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the ice plate stands under tension and can disin@@ teg@@ rate if at a key point a piece is cancelled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is and ice@@ berg is not increasing the sea level as they swim on water , and ice water as much water as it sm@@ ells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the loss of spring causes that the gl@@ ac@@ iers can flow directly into the sea and much faster than before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that could possibly increase the sea level , but only in low extent , writes the British research project to observe Antarc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to AW@@ I data , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is the largest river Antarc@@ tica with almost 50 000 square kilometres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the transition from the mainland up to 700 metres thick , the front edge to the free ocean is around 200 metres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it stops regular there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural happening and no direct link to climate change , the ice plate is now in a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is the wid@@ est retreat since the start of the record . &quot; he confirmed that too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among scientists say , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is will rise again or go back in the long term , said his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even though these researchers have failed to decline this giant ic@@ eber@@ gs on climate change , so in recent decades many ice cre@@ asing of the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula can fall off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this long bridge of Antarc@@ tica extends towards South America .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the British Antarc@@ tic Survey , the ice surface of the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula has declined 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decline in temperature has contributed to decline .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past 50 years , the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula have war@@ med around three degrees and thus t@@ oss in the areas where the temperature is the fastest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
CDU wants to charge skin ho@@ ur@@ ly at the staff
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it becomes more difficult to occupy freely , the CDU calls out of the workers &quot; association to become more attractive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only shortly before the summer break , the K@@ rei@@ den@@ da commissioned 41 new jobs in administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the county administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have their first working day behind themselves .
the teachers in the circle are apparently very popular .
some 620 applications were to be recorded in this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the circle is still missing , in order to overcome the higher demands and tasks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently it is at the circle M@@ ett@@ mann as before 50 not occupied places .
among other things doctors and engineers as well as powers of general management are being sought .
the CDU wants to sei@@ ze the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG so together with the trade angel in the administration .
management should develop a concept for personnel and personnel development by the desire of the parties . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim is to counter@@ act only short @-@ term requirements to experts , but are future @-@ oriented towards application short@@ age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the overall concept should be oriented towards both inside and outside , concrete measures for cross @-@ activity and include practice function , demanding the CDU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that sounds like a good approach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the circle has to do with personal problems , which one knew earlier than not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other towns adverti@@ se good officials and employees and provide more attractive terms .
the speech is by a regular &quot; competition of public employers . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this includes a high number of employees , disease , or age related to the service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so the first time to act is so that no more jobs can remain un@@ owned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter Pe@@ oples , of the CDU of the CDU , went out with his party more about the common application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has long been sor@@ row@@ ful for a f@@ th@@ icker surprise when he ques@@ tioned the personnel fre@@ igh@@ ter , and the remaining parties were amaz@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people want all the ways to be verified , enabling ex@@ iting from the municipal worker organisation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not arrive at short notice to a satisfactory solution , the county management should asp@@ ire to the unions - perhaps in cooperation with the local cities - a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure the CDU , employees and civil servants try to pay better than the public service for public service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money , if you are shifting in a higher level you are orient@@ ated to professional years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the tasks of the circle are growing more in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be furnished to take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitute law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not least by the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy Har@@ bors the tone to the NGO &apos;s migrants
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has NGOs that put the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , have been warned that they may not continue their operations for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not write any new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how to continue working , &quot; Interior Minister Marco Min@@ nit@@ i said in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning was given a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat of the German aid organisation &quot; Youth R@@ ettet &quot; because their squ@@ ad had effectively worked together with human traff@@ ick@@ ers in a way that facilit@@ ated the illegal immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the relief organisation that has been in operation for a year only , refused to out@@ crop the Italian government Amb@@ ro@@ gio Carto@@ sio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us and remains our top priority for the salvation of human life . we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone in the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can judge all accus@@ ations currently being collected if we have collected all information and judge the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Italian authorities have supervised the boat from &apos; youth R@@ ettet , &quot; the I@@ uv@@ enta , since October . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is thought that his crew will ship infl@@ atable fr@@ ills on board , which can be delivered directly from human traff@@ ick@@ ers , and that the mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can be used again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least one such meeting was held only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the Prosecutor &apos;s main acts , the contents of the Italian media have been published . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the occupation is susp@@ ect , on the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , rescue operations in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives to lock it out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the code of conduct , boats shall have to board ships like the I@@ uv@@ enta above all as Italian police officers , who monitored their activities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations , have been willing to answer to the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday , that the new rules as unnecessary , but considered to be no &quot; essential amendments or disability &apos; in their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among those that would refuse to sign , the Nobel Prize Lau@@ re@@ ate , Physi@@ cians without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) is awarded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Min@@ nit@@ i has meanwhile said that the number of migrants drow@@ ned after the rescue measures in Italy , which brought efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast and cooperation with the local people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we began to see light at the end of the tun@@ nels , &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali about measures to reduce these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
asc@@ ents and TRI@@ ALS
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nine W@@ eil@@ er@@ mer Bik@@ er , the &quot; Out@@ posts &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz to enjoy four days of TRI@@ ALS and land@@ marks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this three @-@ friendly guides were available .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .
the Burgundy and wine festival by Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led to hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ Chapel ( above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was followed by viewing points , partly on towers , from which one could look across the pl@@ ung@@ ers of forest and the pl@@ under@@ ed levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in between there were again longer asc@@ ents for the long TRI@@ ALS .
on the second day it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the Volks@@ fest saus@@ age market .
again a look@@ out spot on the look@@ out spot . &quot; flo@@ cked &quot; TRI@@ ALS and moderate asc@@ ents .
on the last two days a lot of altitude difference was possible .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refu@@ ges brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers used in the open @-@ air pois@@ oned sole .
Neu@@ stadt was also ste@@ ered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 173 kilometres and nearly 4500 m altitude , the group had met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Forest from its best side - spor@@ tier and cul@@ turally interested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
console instead of grass - Bundes@@ liga ar@@ ming for e @-@ sport
are the Sport Stars in the future ahead of computer consoles - instead of swe@@ ating oneself in the wind and weather about the stadium ra@@ ses ?
fact : e @-@ Sport has long since become a serious business to become a lu@@ cra@@ tive business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high pitches .
this is also one of the first federal ca@@ ver@@ ns which are increasingly involved in this area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning 2015 , the V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg , later followed the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and la@@ stly the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , which founded an e @-@ sport branch in mid @-@ July and participated two pros for the computer game FIFA 17 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire a whole new target group for the V@@ f@@ B &quot; says Management Board Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann .
he is sure that there are several clubs on this train . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next weekend , the football World Federation organized FIFA in London the first &quot; interactive Club World Cup &quot; where the Gam@@ ers will compete against each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfsburg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven are qualified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Robin D@@ utt looks great potential in the E @-@ Sport .
the ex @-@ trainer by Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advis@@ es a agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real soccer needs to deal with the 14 to 30 years old , that the young people still go to stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 year old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and : the temp@@ ting , all possible markets , especially the Asian , to conquer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with prominent electric sports@@ men under contract , you might now also be present in these markets from more often than once a year , to send the federal government to Asia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is it exactly ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the E @-@ Sport computer games like &quot; league of Legends , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or just the football simulation FIFA at competition level are posted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long ago , as in the normal sport too , lifts are established , in which the pros compete against each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and in the Asian edition E @-@ Sport is already part of the official programme .
is it all about a proper sport@@ al ?
the performance is certainly everyday @-@ needed for many .
Ingo has also dealt with the question for a long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the professor at the German Sports University in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport , because he is com@@ peti@@ tive , and many biological and physical reactions which one can find in classic sport - for example increased heart rate actions , stress re@@ actions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , it need cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast response . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise on the console but also mind their body and mind the diet .
&quot; the following player is a good player . &quot;
but F@@ rob@@ y also sees problems : &quot; d@@ oping is becoming an increasingly subject . &quot;
checks are difficult to perform in online games and in the scene lack@@ ed the structures of classical Sports .
the scientists have a positive impact on the high integ@@ rative effect of the E @-@ Sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players are international on the road , this is like a large global family , there are no inter@@ cultural gen@@ esis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a study conducted by the consulting software Del@@ o@@ itte and the German Association of Interactive entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) imp@@ lies a rapid growth ahead of the E @-@ sport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 they have been wag@@ ered 50 million euros in Germany , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ship and great tournaments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the increase in sales is expected to reach 130 million in three years .
this is little bit of just about 2.4 billion euros of the soccer league .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , be the e @-@ sport &quot; not far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; the Del@@ o@@ itte advisor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
International are already continuing in many countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great markets are Asia and the US , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez are part of the US Team NR@@ G e@@ Sports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

things are doing well in Europe too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a Norwegian school , E @-@ sport has been introduced as a class@@ room , says F@@ rob@@ otic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Netherlands and in France , the soccer @-@ ma@@ liga @-@ publisher has meanwhile been committed to set up an e @-@ sport branch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison Germany was lag@@ ging behind . &quot; explains V@@ FB @-@ executive board of R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only in nostal@@ gia , and the old times to be clari@@ fied , today is no longer enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it is a question to preserve the tradition of the club , but the company is at the same time al@@ igned with the modern market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we live in a digital world &quot; means that they are broken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can &apos;t stick to it that only when football stays in the case , as always it was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter because of the lyrics to push for Conrad Roy to suicide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman from Massachusetts became two and a half years , because she has encouraged her friend through lyrics and calls to suicide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Carter , born 20 , will spend 15 months of their convic@@ tion behind bars and five years of imprisonment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on June 13 , 2014 Carter , Carter was convicted by Conrad Roy who took his life on 13 July 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is incur@@ able .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to remain free to appeal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it had been confron@@ ted by a maximum term of 20 years , but their legal representatives were argu@@ ed that both they and Mr Roy were suffering from a mental illness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dressed in red tro@@ users and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in the eyes , folded with folded hands and facing down eyes as she was convicted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have been killed by Conrad Roy , &quot; said the citizenship of the court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she finished his life to make her own better .
she has no responsibility . &quot; she said .
&quot; she has not shown repent@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ rier was a lawyer , it was a terrible circum@@ stance to un@@ fortun@@ ate them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , did not find out that their &quot; age or maturity or even their mental disease have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pro@@ secutor read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy who had said that there is no day when I don &apos;t pray the loss of my beloved Son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like that he is proud of me and how I am with everything I am trying to be with us , in spite of all my sor@@ rows who will be for eternity and to be for his sisters , &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she would be part of the realization of her brother , who would never be allowed to be part of her brother &apos;s wedding or her aun@@ t for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not more this one person having been together with whom I always been in my birth every day , is a pain I always kept for the rest of my life . &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent because there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime committed to commit suicide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in a vehicle in 2014 with coal @-@ oxid@@ ant pois@@ oning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the case attracted national attention to himself , after Car@@ ters wrote essays , and encouraged him to end his life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hanging on the spring , spring from a building , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , she said in several messages that she had sent over two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments ahead of his suicide , she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is to turn off , and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter sought to attention through the death of Roy , and ordered that they should benefit in any press from the fall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the few , the Carter involved , Am@@ anda Fort , who was convicted in Italy in 2007 , was acquitted of two years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; woman Knox , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and assistance , not prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learning from the New Mini L@@ ah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua took me up by the Audi Cup as captain when the captain was not acci@@ dental .
the FC Bayern tr@@ aut the Con@@ fed Cup winner for a great season - Extra motivation y@@ det out there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anything was different on his seat in the cab , that saw Joshua Kim@@ zy at once , even if the additional piece of clothing was very small . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but as far and wide at the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , no Philipp L@@ ah@@ m and also no Manuel Neuer was to see , he made himself shared bri@@ des on the arms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Trainer has not announced it , &quot; the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner announced that after its first use as a Bayern @-@ Captain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
good standing up could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the character of the coach was also not to interpre@@ t me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not the eight years older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a player leader in youth games , de@@ but@@ ant and just from his holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sugar is ideally distributed to those who want to wear a lot of humor who wants to keep in mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , who select the inheritance of L@@ ah@@ m &apos;s heir , a small additional motivation can use only good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kim@@ mir confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player wants to take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old was flying as Mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m over the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right behind , that is now his position , the white Bin@@ de on the arm did her rest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and at all , Kim@@ me was working as the one who can also take the ru@@ der in his hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he gave instructions to direct the un@@ played tro@@ upe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had the view of the whole , while many others were busy itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ dal therefore to play his missing fitness ( not scar@@ ce ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus , on the h@@ eck , and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Nikl@@ as Sü@@ le begin to stop at their first appearance in Bayern tri@@ cot not neg@@ atively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the thing that worked quite well .
Sü@@ le ran beside me . Rud@@ y was running off the defense ahead of the defense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm hur@@ ried off frequently , and he also tried to play a few times in the playing building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Rud@@ y said that the result was &quot; not so , as we hop@@ ed for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he showed a good achievement in his debut .
game shift , speed change : &quot; I was also fet@@ ched to this style . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as usual , this Bavaria world is still for the new additions , one saw in connection to the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rud@@ y , for example , gave in the Cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs not one or two , but determines six or seven interviews . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kim@@ mir after a few c@@ run@@ chy voices in the back of his new players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he heard there from Sü@@ le a interesting saying : &quot; what goes down here , I already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bavaria you must simply win each game . &quot;
anyway he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was often not con@@ cili@@ atory , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke ( Green ) still Minister of State of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is reflected by more than one year in which the new Minister of Economics Volker Wis@@ dom ( F@@ DP ) is in office .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frank Nat@@ us , President of the Union of Trier , says : &quot; Wis@@ dom gra@@ sp@@ s the desires of the economy , the Lem@@ ke all blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , the Ministry for a plan of planning is hoping to stand up until 2021 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a role in the plans of the country also plays the West@@ um@@ ber@@ y Trier , which is in the un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive needs of the Federal Office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the goal was to take into operation in December 2020 , says Minist@@ eri@@ ze @-@ spokes@@ woman Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ us sees a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competing companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the Cham@@ bers of Commerce and Industry ( C@@ CI ) is stimulated in producing a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports for ten years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , Wis@@ sing also has an open ear for people who want to set up an own company , designed the Chamber of Commerce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Handwerk@@ skammer Trier sees in the new Master Bonus added an additional incen@@ tive for young trainees , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the premium of $ 1000 is fore@@ seen for the fair master testing and 2500 Euro , if graduates are self @-@ employed for students within ten years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when planned road construction is quick to create facts , also out of the country on the necessary staff , Jan Glock@@ auer says the chief executive branch of the Chamber of Commerce in Trier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to date , only 29 jobs have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to set up the knowledge in the national department . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the C@@ CI calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CDU &amp; Sp@@ vi@@ ze Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to calculations of the host@@ name , the country invested more than 20 million euros in 2017 and 2018 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Frank Nat@@ us is still looking forward to a concept of the country as it wants to empha@@ size the subject of hol@@ es@@ angel in the region .
be more serious about the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 , the regional companies had contributed to the supply of the network with a survey of 3.4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compl@@ ained about alter@@ nate Internet connections and breaks .
ex @-@ econom@@ ist Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Green Group left Lem@@ ke on April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where she already cleared the field after four months of in@@ consi@@ sten@@ cies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Audi is supposed to change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are faced with a counter @-@ reaction
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer the software to update more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW @-@ President said that &quot; it is the opinion that &quot; it gives smar@@ ter options &quot; constra@@ ints , &quot; and he moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based on or restri@@ ct diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Daimler announced on Tuesday , that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of the companies described the enterprises as a recall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; European autom@@ akers have promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with regulations for carbon dioxide emissions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , nitrogen oxi@@ des , em@@ itting the diesel engines , are considered car@@ cin@@ ogenic , and can cause asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the costs for autom@@ akers , systems for neutr@@ alisation of diesel vehicles to be installed from diesel vehicles , also take advantage of making it difficult to maintain the price of cars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignore the powerful car companies and to ignore the problems of the problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen , which could regul@@ ate the use of so @-@ called amor@@ tisation equipment to comply with the provisions if a car has been tested , but with normal driving conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the United States , several employees were indicted by Volkswagen , and others are examined at both sides of the Atlantic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former head of Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics in the engine development of Audi was arrested in Germany last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be placed in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi has been included in German criminal investigations regarding Volkswagen to have installed a system in order to circul@@ ate the emissions requirements in Europe , and a request that concentrated on the United States was expanded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could be difficult to use Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer , which is largely committed to Volkswagen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this message gave the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the Is@@ ar Vis@@ itors can also take a raft on Saturday a raft through Munich , which has a special message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it moves to Is@@ ar on Saturday the Is@@ ar will see a big float there between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach bridge .
and this is no ordinary Flo@@ od with Is@@ ar &apos;s tourists .
but the idea wants to clari@@ fy .
at the raft you see a great info point .
it shows a waste mountain .
the pre@@ lu@@ de to an announcement campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
with the motto &quot; True Love ... &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar is to def@@ use as a protective flu@@ ence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last summer the raft passed over the Is@@ ar and also this year , there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
morph@@ ine addic@@ ts and the laughter against the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was temporarily one of the most widely published cartoon animation . his ni@@ bun@@ ni@@ es of his figures are his trademark .
also in 85 the Argent@@ in@@ ini@@ er and also works on a film .
his message : laughter &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first years as an artist , he spread among other things as a sket@@ ner for congrat@@ ulation , which was fru@@ str@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ ier day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job . &quot; he said again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after stations in Lima , New York and Paris succeeded in placing a breakthrough with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again the artist had been inspired by the artists .
large un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures are che@@ ating in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the early morning he is still sitting on the drawing , working daily for nearly ten hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about calendar , puzzles , books for large and small , T @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush animals and watches find its dro@@ pl@@ ous figures continues to spread wide spread worldwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for six years , he has also been working on a animation film and a TV series with his figures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main person in the film &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - murder of any test@@ es in his drawings - that has a thousand c@@ enti@@ ls as a counter@@ part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , its figures speak to the 3D movie that should be in 2019 on the cinema screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know what they are saying it &apos;s strange to me . &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo .
the script is not written of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is why he talks rather to the TV series that is , as its original drawings , is literally produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
la@@ ven@@ der threatened by Provence from climate change
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der is falling due to drought conditions remin@@ ding insects , which causes scientists and farmers trying to find solutions to find solutions , great head@@ ache . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eric Cha@@ isse in Provence &apos;s agricultural research institution in Provence said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence said : &quot; the Lav@@ ande in Provence was effectively threatened because the plant has brought a lot less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn .
this has effects on the life of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is also a small Z@@ ik@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium , the Zwer@@ g@@ zi@@ k@@ ades , and with very dry weather there is a lot of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there is much on the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil is not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers ; it is also very important for perfume and cosmetics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said , &quot; instead of very long plant breeding with a great number of flowers we have smaller , under@@ developed and either lack of or weakened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the solutions that are taken into account includes a better water distribution and the slow@@ ing of evap@@ oration from clay , but also the improvement of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of sorts , which are more resistant to dry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the little town of Ge@@ isa in the th@@ ern@@ ing R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1200 @-@ year anniversary .
Fes@@ tive highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a mean age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dealers , guil@@ ds , tra@@ ders , distributors or a landing camp are to be experienced during these days in the city center . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the assassination of journalists emphas@@ ises the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the staff of weekly Rio@@ do@@ ce meet normally on Wedn@@ esdays in order to review their plans regarding the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ al@@ oa , organised crime , corrupt civil and un@@ ce@@ asing drug wars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to speak about security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was told them that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two high level repor@@ ters discuss what feels safer : they are to take their children into the office , which were the target of an attack with gren@@ ades , or they were at home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security experts have written three words on a plaque on the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they kindly ask the Rep@@ orter ; name for each column - no evidence is necessary to per@@ cep@@ tions and abdominal exercise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are drug s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand on the secret list of the government or the cart@@ els , which can make the chaos of Mexico . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no resting break from violence , and while throughout the country there are no more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to have succeeded in attacks and threats under federal protection and up to now , there were at least seven dead in seven countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the latter are you edited by and her In@@ spir@@ ator from Rio@@ do@@ ce to co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his absence is im@@ it@@ ated , although its presence is present everywhere - a large photo by Val@@ dez , which shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; carry T @-@ Shirts , who show his smiling face with glasses or its typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the workshop will take place less than two months after his death , and repor@@ ters discuss their shared topics , trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although a Son@@ ja Bar Association was built in 2010 in order to process journalists from journalists , this no@@ isy was directed only two criminal proceedings to protect journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with most thousands of mur@@ ders , each year associated with drug traff@@ icking and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely presented to court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Rio@@ do@@ ce they still exist to treat the violence of Sin@@ al@@ oa , although they are in@@ tr@@ unc@@ ated and even though the terrain is still sp@@ illed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without any information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting of the safety of safety , says I@@ bar@@ ra , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very stupid to w@@ ander my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why we mi@@ str@@ ust all . &quot;
in the morning of 15 May Val@@ dez left the office of the Newspaper Rio@@ do@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he managed to drive a few blocks away before his car was stopped by two men before his car was forced and 12 times he was shot down , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; twel@@ fth river . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bell drove away in his car and damaged it in the proximity .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left one woman and two grown children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly off in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but there is virtually nothing but silence about the theme of Val@@ dez .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in last year and extra@@ dition in the United States was Sin@@ al@@ oa became one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ lefield in January , Rival fac@@ tions strug@@ gles here to fill the vacuum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is nothing that in Sin@@ al@@ oa every day someone or several men on the road are shot or that the cemetery is full of eaten two @-@ storey maus@@ ole@@ ums for those wishing to live . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; forget about a minute that there is a state of peace , if only one cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its precious har@@ bours and drugs trade routes in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , co @-@ founder and director of Rio@@ do@@ ce , with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , in February the publication of a interview with Dam@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the Rival fac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans @-@ sons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this release may be anno@@ yed by the children , susp@@ ending gangs were sold as soon as she was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second fault in this was not to force Val@@ dez , after the sei@@ z@@ ure of another newspaper which had published the same story , the country to its own security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues got that he would always be there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he worked as a repor@@ ter for Nor@@ ns in 2003 , when he joined by five colleagues to the creation of Rio@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ al@@ oa , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without ref@@ using to the pre@@ ven@@ om problem , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by time , the newspaper has served a reputation for cour@@ a@@ geous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising ass@@ ump@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; repor@@ ters loving it to be deb@@ ating without fear of c@@ ens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that didn &apos;t dare any else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eight years after the founding of Rio@@ do@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot prize &quot; for their reporting in Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists from the persecution of Mexican drug history , where she always led them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he gave himself up voluntarily that he was afraid .
&quot; I would like to continue to live &quot; at the time of the CP@@ J @-@ Award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug traff@@ icking in Sin@@ al@@ oa &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV in October . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need to take over the task which falls to you as a journalist , either it or you play the stupid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked , &quot; What did you do with such a multitude ... why did you not say what went ahead ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Rio@@ do@@ ce team att@@ aches Val@@ dez , the Sp@@ a@@ ß@@ vo@@ gel who was like a harbour worker , who was generous with hu@@ gs and counsel , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always bear his hat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ an@@ , the bar opposite the office , and sit there at the same table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now ask them : was his love for routine and destruction ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his death has also forced them to ask their own approach , how they can accomplish their work on the best and stay alive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it if you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home starting and run@@ ways to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is to be in the best times a high level of self @-@ quality and self @-@ holding .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it sm@@ ells bad , stay away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the anger is , the publisher of la Rio@@ do@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the thing has happened with Javier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old rules as he and others say , in Sin@@ al@@ oa , are not more - just like in Tam@@ au@@ stri@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a toxic mixture of lu@@ cra@@ tive s@@ mu@@ gs , weak institutions and corrupt government officials . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the landscape constantly changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the room where the employees of Rio@@ do@@ ce came for safety training , there were suddenly no mobile phones , which was sold exclusively to governments who was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; outside , two polic@@ emen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were assigned by the state government to protect the offices of Rio@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a middle class from Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half in the sh@@ ear , some of the repor@@ ters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen , who mentioned the Governor itself as not trusted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is months ago , since the repor@@ ter went into the mountain landscape , where the drug was de facto under control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the issue of this week Rio@@ do@@ ce has blocked three main stories .
it was the assassination of the brother of the former known conductor Julio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ al@@ oa .
they had also a com@@ pos@@ é to the state spending that concentrated on the home town of the governor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the Office , a kidn@@ apping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no official word about it who has been kidn@@ apped or like it happened , so it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite locally of drug hands and authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a repor@@ ter learned that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution party ( PR@@ I ) , who ruled all political levels almost all the century . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several PR@@ I Govern@@ ors have recently been accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked repor@@ ter to write about previous events in this restaurant , among them one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only a few months earlier , the reader had viewed the column from Val@@ dez as the best informed source of the kidn@@ apping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before we had already knew what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its slim physi@@ que . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the office of Val@@ dez was devoted to the storage room for signs and sti@@ cker , which was prot@@ esting against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something that they would have never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; repor@@ ter Miri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez over@@ turned a few signs , and went next morning to a demonstration for another journalist &apos;s office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared after three days after Val@@ dez was killed and in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a burnt mind was discovered , and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is of his . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; throughout the country , journalists have become more powerful as they have written in organised protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on side@@ ways and buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone to Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case Val@@ dez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a meeting with Governor von Sin@@ al@@ oa on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez acc@@ use the authorities to sp@@ ade journalists and destroy them , because they said the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has been asking her to be sub@@ divided from the government , because she is worried that her rage has hurt her objec@@ tivity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez said that journalists in Mexico had been surrounded by organised crime , government officials and a valid society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that Rep@@ orter may not only be killed by drug issues but also on orders of politicians and security forces that were with the organised crime under a ceiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the Media Guard group &quot; Artic@@ ulated 19 &quot; has assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico do you die , because they want to keep the mouth , &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of the blog@@ ger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ stri@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her body was found along with a note , which is supposed allegedly signed by the Z@@ etas AF , &quot; Here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer keyboard and ear@@ phones lay next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assassination of the correspon@@ dents of Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ va Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do how El Man@@ ana von Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assassination of her director in 2004 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ arez publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an article on the title page &quot; What do you want of us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some journalists fled from their home country or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and seek dangers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sometimes they ch@@ ased , like the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was born in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those who continue to stay and continue work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky choices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bar@@ ra who once wanted to be a poet who gave it amaz@@ ed to the drug traff@@ icking him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico is going to hell , and therefore I became repor@@ ter , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last edition was already finished , the editors from Rio@@ do@@ ce were sitting on the pav@@ ement prior to the office and drank beer , than all her teleph@@ ones began to sum@@ s up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a number of sho@@ wer@@ ies with riv@@ ets and security forces close to the Maz@@ at@@ lan bathing resort had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war escal@@ ated how it was promised by a series of Kartell &apos;s messages in the region .
from the ker@@ bs you have released the news on the website of Rio@@ do@@ ce about mobile .
the introduction page had to be changed on the next day .
si@@ rens are placed nearby - a further shooting in the area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez cast a look at the police officers , the guards , to see whether they were read@@ iness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they were afraid , they didn &apos;t show it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the huge portrait of the fallen Grün@@ ders of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for quite Sin@@ al@@ oa , the staff of la Rio@@ do@@ ce followed its tracks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you only think about that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; when on the same day , the train@@ ee asked me to send them to the road to the road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ouflage to rever@@ t his enemies
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at first sight it looks like a statue , though a sc@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible Nash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian min@@ ers have been so well preserved that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was so good that they could even find that his fl@@ aky skin was scor@@ ching brown - and they said , it would have had something from a troubled past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report in Current Biology &quot; described him as &quot; the incar@@ cer@@ ated Din@@ osau@@ rs , who ever was found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs world in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fossil is a re@@ discovered kind of no@@ dos@@ osau@@ rs , who lived in the centre of the chal@@ k time between 110 million and 112 million years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his incredibly well preserved state has researchers , that amaz@@ ed it as &quot; really remarkable &quot; , failed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic the ar@@ mo@@ red plant fres@@ ser is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , on 21 March 2011 at the Sun@@ cor M@@ illen@@ ium Mine , near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he met on something that seemed out of the surrounding rock , and decided to look at more accurately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild beast within the 2,500 pounds ( 1.@@ 100 kg ) heavy gro@@ wer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all this hard work , the final result is now ready to be revealed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you b@@ link just a little with your eyes , you almost believe that it has failed , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum where the creation is depicted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s going to be one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs specimens - the Mon@@ a Lisa the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; researchers have found that this plant e@@ aters , although he is covered with a ag@@ ony and re@@ sembles a converting tanks , probably endangered by bo@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the heavily arm@@ oured Din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide from pre@@ face , and used a par@@ agli@@ ding technology that is used as a counter @-@ prot@@ ector that is also used by many modern animals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would have been allowed to blend better in its surroundings and to sof@@ ten his enemies , say something that suggests that it was threatened with larger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the family of the no@@ dos@@ berry has made the first lines for the first time in May and is now at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Bo@@ realis@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum technici@@ an Mark Mitchell , one of a team who has spent more than 7.000 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the amazing preserve of copy made it possible to Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of scales and arm@@ our on his body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they discovered the sh@@ ady , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the tip of the creation was dar@@ ker than their under@@ side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the con@@ sign@@ ment is common , the results are unexpected , since the size of bo@@ oth@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the animals living today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it indicates that din@@ osau@@ rs ro@@ amed the din@@ osau@@ rs from n@@ ishing Din@@ osau@@ rs , that the evolution of the confron@@ tation was fav@@ oured as a means of survival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but most contemporary animals that use the sh@@ ady , think of deer , Zeb@@ ras , or Arma@@ ged@@ don , are much smaller and vulner@@ able than prey that was exposed to a real struggle for survival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; powerful pre@@ dat@@ ory behavior based on a massive , strong ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs ro@@ amed the chal@@ k time , &quot; Brown said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scientists continue to investigate the animal on critics about his life , including his con@@ served performance , to find what it had eaten as its last meal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died when he was driven into a river and sank into the sea , sank off the sea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , Alberta was as warm as South fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely to spread far inland than they are today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ cope is really remarkable because it is covered completely with preser@@ ving skin but also maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; Brown said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is , that the animal today looks almost exactly the same as in early K@@ rei@@ de@@ zeit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t need to use a lot of imagination , to recon@@ struct it . if you just ch@@ atting a little with the eyes , you almost believe that he is at bed@@ time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chal@@ k time was a time when giant sp@@ oo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , that rose on two legs on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the King of them lived before the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus rex , millions of years after her@@ ap@@ op@@ el@@ ta lived , the ar@@ mo@@ red Din@@ osau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of his fac@@ tual ancestors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus comes with a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long and six tonnes of heavy monsters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scientists , their latest findings in Current Biology , believe that bo@@ ard@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in sea and sank in mud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the creature was found on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ cor M@@ illen@@ ium Mine , near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the museum it is the bu@@ si@@ red Din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet ( 5 feet ) long and have weigh@@ ed up to 3.000 pounds ( 1.@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that ra@@ ged from his shoulders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers believe that the ar@@ mo@@ red plant fres@@ ser was sh@@ ielded by the western Canada , until a floo@@ ded river was floo@@ ded into the open sea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ rs kept his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ n@@ ants of this special copy are so well preserved that the Hau@@ tre@@ sts cover still fet@@ ched por@@ ters along the din@@ osau@@ r
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as rare as a lot@@ tery in lot@@ tery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the more I see it , the more conf@@ using will .
pet@@ ri@@ fied resi@@ due of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y tanks that carry the skull of the animal .
his right front foot rests on his side . his five fingers are spread out upwards .
I can count the scales at his sole . &quot;
during thunder@@ storms : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A8 : many injured
heavy accident on Thursday night on the A8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a massage roller .
there are numerous Ver@@ le@@ den miles long st@@ alls - and G@@ aff@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Autobahn Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , on the late Thursday afternoon , some 20 people were injured in the morning Thursday afternoon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the first data on the police at 17.00 hr@@ ates between the junction , Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) , during a thunder@@ storm , nearly 30 vehicles , among them also trucks that are cla@@ d together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at first , there is no indication of the exact number of recent publishers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a light to moderate injuries and had a police @-@ fir@@ ing .
a big offer of rescue vehicles was at the accident scene .
the A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
a roughly ten kilometres long rel@@ ap@@ stone was formed in the Munich direction of Munich .
like a AZ Rep@@ orter reports it was also on the opposite way to massive disabilities - by numerous G@@ aff@@ ers .
the fire brig@@ ade listed itself from the registration plates that have now been expected to have delicate pun@@ ishments .
shortly after 18 : 45 there was a second accident on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a coll@@ ision between a car transporter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter route was on the road to the accident scene .
Deutsche Bahn : Group tested &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a moment that almost everyone has seen before , nothing can be seen in the train and sleeps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
or you are deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buffer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the Schaff@@ ner comes , wi@@ g@@ out an in@@ dig@@ nation , or g@@ aps in the middle of the workflow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ticket security check .
but the time of breaks are over .
the German Rail is currently testing the managed ticket insp@@ ections .
they are simply confirmed by phone that one has taken up his seat and evalu@@ ates the ticket .
there is currently a test operation on two routes .
&quot; if the offer goes to pass we can pass it out .
at the beginning of next year it will be available on many other railway routes in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; is called by train the ticket analysis without creating jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use this , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and you have to have booked an online ticket - what &apos;s already the most of the passengers already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must also be bought by Rail , DB Navigator app , which is why the most convenient way of ticket booking is anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and finally you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; works so : one goes into the train , calling his ticket under &quot; My tickets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the test customers then appears a button on the electronic identification .
the ten@@ si@@ le accompanied on their mobile devices a message that Fahr@@ g@@ ast X has taken up in the train and took the booked seat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes the train accompanied by card control at rank , and he knows that there is a passenger with already processed online ticket . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so one can still sleep and continue to be silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the client , one for the train - which in turn shall use the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to travel without ticket insp@@ ections , check out the DB Navigator easily himself in the DB Navigator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this enables the passengers to personally design their travel time in the train of personal approach , &quot; says Michael Saint Peter &apos;s marketing executive board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the second plus : &quot; and our employees have more time to enter into individual needs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those often are track , knows that in addition to delays and passes the ticket insp@@ ections are among the greatest nu@@ ances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for often , in any case , however , one of the participants do not need all the documents that you need for dev@@ al@@ uation of online tickets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you either lack the credit card or ID card or a document that has to be noted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is endless discussions between train accompanied and passenger , leading to bad mood in the br@@ ushing or greater burden and delays within the end time takes time to take care of other concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a small number of test@@ ers can use the new service .
and this also only on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further train numbers on the same route are not un@@ locked yet .
how a activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 9 August 2014 , Fer@@ rell was shaken by a core . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a day after having arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis sat on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b flat which she rented and sc@@ roll@@ ed by Facebook on their phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they stum@@ bled upon a post from somebody from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it &apos;s still on the street &apos; , it was named there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confused when no one had posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly saved on their tim@@ eline .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ra@@ pper from the region of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown who was killed by a white polic@@ eman from F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed live . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he post@@ pon@@ ed a picture of Brow@@ ns intact body , which was stretched on the street and would stay there four hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is wild@@ ly known , &quot; thought Fer@@ rell . &quot;
but death was nothing new for her and her community .
she made her cell phone to return to Twe@@ ets over people later on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive along the evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were photos of the police and people who were crying , and from a man who claimed to be a sign with the wording : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Police had just killed my armed son ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
watching a live feed where a polic@@ eman stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bar@@ king dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , the other polic@@ eman secured his rif@@ le and cried , &quot; I will kill you all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is not custom@@ ary . &quot; Fer@@ rell rec@@ alled her testimony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder , to which we used to call us and which we can call . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in that moment I felt ch@@ ills .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
they booked a flight back and went home the next day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after landing at 23 o &apos;clock she collected her 6 year old daughter from the house of her father , and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cin@@ emas from the 11 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a history of survival and the condem@@ nation , the strength and the resistance , which consists of the view of mankind , which live in the community and asking them to demand answers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a fer@@ encing with their daughter , who bore a piece of flower and a perfect crown to fet@@ ch her many times in the morning , over the black experience and the black state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they remembered that which she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed a 18 year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not take her with me &quot; said Fer@@ rell later .
&quot; what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it must know it and they will see it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must be well developed , not just activ@@ ism and organisation , but also the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves to free ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if I were lucky to give you an experience in which she personally does not experience an ek@@ de@@ ous rac@@ ism , it is no different from the next black women child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have the feeling , I would give her a bad service to keep them far off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authorities that were waiting for the impossible Non @-@ accus@@ ation of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and Fer@@ rell and her daughter have joined a local partner who made lunch .
they prepared bags before and helped to transfer them to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly began to accept a new kind of activ@@ ism for Fer@@ rell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my activ@@ ism has changed after the 9th of August , she said and not@@ ices that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health im@@ perfec@@ tions in black communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has come all . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rell met in an evening at Sab@@ a@@ ah Pan@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an said that she and her comra@@ de Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted only &quot; documented &quot; what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question came to this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would you document or try to find a story which you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this skep@@ tic@@ ism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of the White - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; we had heard that people who are born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , who have not cent@@ red their voices and we wanted to make it different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ ct . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his involvement has been closer to the project , along with six other local people followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns capture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us , speaks to us . we speak , &quot; Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me , as these people are presented , because I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the goal was not to focus on Fer@@ re@@ ll@@ s experience - to show that it concerns itself in motion . &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an , she proved to be the most obvious number of participants in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets show ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ re@@ ll@@ s live as she mar@@ ries and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understand that there must be certain vulner@@ ability in this work and the dissemin@@ ation of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Fer@@ re@@ ll@@ s is repe@@ ating the role of the black gay women in the bro@@ ader black @-@ lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two of the three founders of the movement , which have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in 2012 , identify the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the motion in total , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we constantly batt@@ ling on several fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
black , gay women have to bear the main load of everything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; the movement is really held securely by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ mative type of action , &quot; having been chosen as the heart of the film by the Fer@@ rell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy . &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a co@@ incidence , though it was at the foref@@ ront , because in a life on these cru@@ ises as a black , gay woman is so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can sense your energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on has long since disappeared , but the ra@@ cial connections between the church and the police continue to exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fer@@ rell is for 2 ½ years due to the blocking of a highway with a demonstration .
it describes the soci@@ op@@ oli@@ tical atmosphere of the area that they call her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , it rel@@ ates to a singing and she feels obliged to remember that since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
&quot; dream &quot; to meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV reader discuss about bit gallery
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bit gallery moves the people , although they are not yet built . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the idea of a shopping center at the beginning of the pedestrian prec@@ edes the population in advoc@@ ates and opponents since the first presentation of 2009 .
it hardly leaves the subject .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whilst visiting a bit gallery : &quot; this would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; This is really great , &quot; does not need a man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ elt ) or simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ ry ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the advoc@@ ates build that a gallery attracts more customers in the city , including the remaining shops , fear the opponents and then the pedestrian zone are bleeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
added : the Gallery is planned exactly on the property where the farm market stands in which 13 direct mark@@ ers will market their products .
the construction will be concluded with the start of the construction work .
the Gallery M@@ acher wants to integrate a market hall in the new building - and on Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with a possibility to sit outside .
Simone Room : &quot; we &apos;ve been shopping in the farmers market for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farm women are very happy .
we also discovered the but@@ cher shop for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we would wish that even during and especially after building the gallery , there is a chance to maintain this offer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in other cities there is also .
the small market hall in Frankfurt especially is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether the director will market in a market hall in the gallery will arrive at the level of rent .
the new project should probably not be especially low . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; for what kind of shopping in Bit@@ burg ?
whether Cl@@ othing , Foot@@ wear and drug or Super@@ markets : I find the superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is enough of it in our city .
you can see how many shops are vac@@ ated here - some for months and years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since there is not even an ordinary weekly market , it is all the more important that us at least get the market hall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because at least the goods offered there is fresh , mostly offered directly from the producer and is also inexpensive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you can see , shop stores are rented in a shopping centre only by larger companies because the fl@@ aps are often not acceptable for a re@@ ta@@ iler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too bad , specialty shops are almost no more and that which is still remaining , will probably still disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a shopping center with a market hall does not fit for me .
and the gallery does not match to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the peas@@ ant market place during construction time ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even on duration , if the bit gallery will actually come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
or does it manage to sell the bit bit gallery before starting out all shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that &apos;s just not going to work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a shopping center that stands empty , there is also no one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my view , it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but for a farmers market we give thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg no place more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the peas@@ ant market is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York many faces were seen - white , black and brown that are almost un@@ noticeable - that are hanging on the cables from the ceiling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from Wan@@ gen @-@ T@@ up@@ pers and hair@@ cut , which were sent to you from Chelsea Mann@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mann@@ ing made the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former military service analy@@ st made a 35 @-@ year prison sentence when she publicly appointed as a secret report on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on 2 August , is called Bec@@ oming Res@@ emb@@ lance ( a matching simil@@ arity ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is the product of two years Cor@@ respon@@ dence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was inter@@ linked to Barack Obama as he had been turned away from Barack Obama as he had only three days in his office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ we@@ y Hag@@ borg has been extracted by the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA , which could be created by Mann@@ ing , as someone could be interpreted using these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways as they can be interpreted and created by inher@@ ent determin@@ ations of these interpre@@ tations - but also to identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mann@@ ing who was born by Brad@@ ley Edward , but already since their pu@@ ber@@ ty was convicted by the identification as a woman , including six violations of the laws , computer fraud and theft . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the prison their image was supp@@ ressed , so much that it was only one single photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie while sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and a plat@@ in@@ blonde bar@@ sel has been associated with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y Hag@@ borg was just returned from the big success of their 2012 &quot; Stran@@ ger V@@ isions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therein , the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigarette lighter and chew@@ ing gum to create a picture of that which might look like these people might look . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a magazine magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted to accompany a kind of portrait to accompany this article . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and she could not visit this time and she could not be visited , so did you get in touch with Chelsea and asked whether she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the artist and her imprisoned M@@ use were made to un@@ equal Bri@@ eff@@ i who exchanged several letters over the course of two years .
they even created a cartoon by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o with illustr@@ ate the &quot; supp@@ ressed images &quot; which would have predicted a future in which the president of Chel@@ y@@ ton would be able to see the exhibition personally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Obama actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing would call for seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome kind of happy gathering . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is also a deep sleep in the opening of the exhibition some deep and strong , because Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ t from the governmental camp and against trans@@ forma@@ tive ways to remedy the rigid divisions , which he should actually fix it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when De@@ we@@ y Hag@@ borg , after the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen to a certain reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in one on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing with their outstanding signature among them ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is provided with a heart ) an end of &quot; automatic shut@@ ting that has been gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the opposite wall , her mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - an exchange of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ we@@ y Hag@@ borg hopes to show the inclusion of 200 letters ( or nucle@@ ot@@ ids to the high @-@ developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , like amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what people will hopefully take away that our gen@@ ome is not taking care of who we are and how openly challenged they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y Hag@@ borg , whose video work from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , therefore the 30 of these stories are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last piece in the exhibition , reserved in a separate room , is a page of the legendary comic book . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it shows Mann@@ ing , as it emerges with a free @-@ pre@@ cht@@ el@@ ef@@ on from the United States from the United States such as King Kong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when ch@@ ill your speech , then they have won , &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; never mind the mouth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; the artist , who greet me from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps that I speak about it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mann@@ ing has not yet seen the exhibition , as it was fore@@ seen in the comic book - but if they should do it , then in the middle of the room it will be welcomed by its own gen@@ om@@ ic simulation , such as hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing st@@ ature ) , where their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with a pencil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , I had it on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd , &quot; De@@ we@@ y Hag@@ borg said from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement that feels with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind their liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
University of North@@ western University of North@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , which was chosen as susp@@ ects in a luxurious apartment in Chicago , with deadly injuries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) warran@@ ts issued for murder because of her alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H.

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several sticks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the vice president for university relationships , said in an e @-@ mail expl@@ aining that L@@ ath@@ em had been buried alive and excluded from the emergence of the North@@ western University campus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal matter that is studied by the relevant authorities , and the North@@ western University co@@ operates at this inquiry . &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail explanation , that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK , to help the US investigations in any conc@@ eivable way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ rens &apos;s colleague were shocked and want to be aware of it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chief Communications Officer of the police authorities of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said that he strongly ur@@ ges the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police has an idea of her residence , and our efforts to locate it , rein@@ force itself , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , local and national authorities help find the susp@@ ects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received a reven@@ ge tip that had something happened in apartment 100@@ 8 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police described the scene as a very cruel man .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that it was un@@ clear whether the incident took place on 27 July .
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the sacrifice had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published a declaration on the inhabitants : &quot; the police currently works on the tim@@ eline , and the background of the victim and explo@@ res a variety of motives , including a possible housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - the Russian Vice President Mut@@ ko
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Russian Vice @-@ President Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said , I won &apos;t last long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) are implemented for restoration of the Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain stage , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA aims to plan and test the right in collaboration with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA map , which describes the criteria for the replacement of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organization &apos;s website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to mut@@ ko , he doesn &apos;t contain anything that could cause any cause for Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; everything was announced that everything will be implemented .
and the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future . &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , one of the criteria listed in the list ad@@ mits that the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities decided to publicly accept the reported d@@ olls in Russian sports by Canadian attorney Richard McLaren . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we carry out an issue because our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has got a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programs , and we won &apos;t admit what does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mut@@ k@@ os &apos;s words coinci@@ ded with those of Vit@@ aly S@@ mir@@ no@@ v to the director of the independent Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping Commission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with the Russian sales office R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day , S@@ mir@@ no@@ v issues the past given in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organisations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly stated that the report disputed positions and regulations contains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nobody has to accept this report sel@@ fl@@ essly . &quot; added S@@ mir@@ no@@ v .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ US@@ A@@ DA , in November 2015 , was excluded from the execution of d@@ oping control in Russia by WA@@ DA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it was allowed to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following a visit to the main conference of Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ General @-@ General Olivier Nig@@ gli announced that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moves up into the right direction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ di sells not only eggs more
all of the corporate groups shared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a pure precaution , there can be continued further from any health draw@@ back , it was written in Communication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from now on , only eggs can be supplied to Al@@ di , which has been proven to be tested negative on fi@@ ably anti @-@ can@@ opy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ di wants to produce clarity and transparency with their customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start @-@ ups , which will help your company , will not become the next u@@ ber &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Amy Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to compete in her colleagues working with her e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the p@@ olls did not work .
answers were often v@@ ague too little helpful or worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and even when you promised An@@ ony@@ m@@ ity , a certain workers are not ashamed of the trial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Company Madison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she sum@@ mon@@ ed people from outside to help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new breed of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at wa@@ xing , to help companies find out how their employees feel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by creating and licens@@ ing software to offer the specific purpose of the monitoring of employees , they allow companies to deal with corporate groups and demo@@ graphic groups to handle specialised groups and demo@@ graphic groups to address the C @-@ Suite Manager and directly contact the Board of Directors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics tools are used to measure employees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ ret@@ t said that she has a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t won . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to S@@ nap @-@ surveys and surveys of certain teams , there is a heat card of the company which have shown most complaints and which executives can have low @-@ quality results - so you can drill out why . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture , so that you won &apos;t be involved at the top of the workplace , since a former employee is involved in sc@@ and@@ als , in which those who have spoken , have been pun@@ ish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Start @-@ U@@ ps like G@@ lin@@ t this desire is according to an overview of a lu@@ cra@@ tive business possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; global govern@@ ance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , after the financial technical website let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , who helps to prevent and identify clear behaviour , saw an increasing interest and activity in the beginning of this year in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ ver@@ cent has almost 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla .
u@@ ber recently signed as a client .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent companies can send tailored &quot; Pul@@ se &quot; Sur@@ ve@@ ys to view confidential answers in real time and view the warmth map of your problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line which can report in bad behavior .
and when the Managing Director is included , complaints are going to go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the public opinion is recorded by regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a company is found that its staff is poor or im@@ eth@@ ically beha@@ ved , it may experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cott , worker fluctu@@ ation and cavi@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , has become sure that employees are aware of the politics and procedures and have a simple opportunity to achieve their corporate headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e @-@ mail to corporate headquarters , and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was often a curiosity and un@@ comfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ YS General Coun@@ sel which said , there was no good way to pursue the complaints of employees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , as the company can introduce Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that were previously identified and addressed in offices in cities or countries , were identified - like discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ fair internship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view in the experience with employment &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who direc@@ ts the risk management Group by Ruby Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders before employment matters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2002 , the company began to take ethics , values , and employees in 2002 , after the En@@ ron company Arthur Ander@@ sen broke through the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , said Quin@@ lan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; Social Media &quot; came to their right , &quot; they realized that you could not prevent your dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said he . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer their software as a service , and charge the company with recur@@ ring charges for use of their products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a business model and a chance to find the approval by Venture Capital investors , which supports both launch @-@ ups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secured in November by Bes@@ se@@ mer Venture Partners , secured its entire financing to $ 60 million in November . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these investments are hardly surprising in view of the inter@@ connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a growing complex of research , showing that today &apos;s employees expect more jobs than before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , there are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the staff want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated , giving you your time to a company with a positive mission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when people are happy to be in a company , and the work that they do is worth to do , &quot; Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Employ@@ ee Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In who uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
An@@ ders reach Ren@@ di@@ tes when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well if employees are standing and eng@@ aging .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the Analytics tools have third promise to increase commitment and the deployment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find assistance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is important for the employee involvement in accordance with the experts of the workplace culture .
but the data is useless if the managers of an enterprise do not take action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , when a company asks staff on your feedback , it can have a expecting that change is on the way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and when the change is not fast enough , or not at all , this dis@@ appoint@@ ments can be cultivated and motivated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you ask for 4.000 suggestions , you have to be willing to have 4.000 meetings , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at Business Management company Kot@@ or International , who has seen themselves too much to collect data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you will not follow people ask yourself , &quot; Did you really hear me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you take care of that ?
and who does not care about why should I take care of ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madison Re@@ ed , which now performs in monthly staff surveys , was able to guide measures on the same day if a problem about G@@ lin@@ t is reported to rescue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and after collecting any feedback from the fru@@ str@@ ated staff , it was capable of organizing group and quality of communication , capable of organizing several teams within the company and to add a communications training to tackle the problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Ruby Tuesday , the company always receives new insights on the employees , and it hopes that on a long term this leads to a better binding of workers in a sector that is well known for high revenues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and when you lose men you also lose clients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose customers , you will lose companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Bru@@ ins
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it runs at 23 o &apos;clock , when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A foot@@ ball@@ ers enter@@ tained on one side of the new Practice @-@ fields of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some have drawn their tri@@ cot tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a good part of the team , this time is a lunch break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players who are enrolled to the summer courses will return to their final insp@@ ections , before the next morning at 6 : 30 o &apos;clock to the Aqu@@ arius Football Center . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s for the guys the next three days a real Tre@@ t@@ mill &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday to Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the N@@ CA@@ A eliminated two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why the first three sessions of U@@ CL@@ A should begin at 19 : 15 to meet the already packed schedules of players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the compromise way of those two days is delayed for a week after the last season , and during the summer school during Mor@@ as six times during the summer school during Mor@@ as during Mor@@ as during the summer school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should take 18 exercises in the course of August 18 exercises . 20 before the beginning of formal game preparations for their pre@@ lu@@ de against Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MOR@@ A said that he assi@@ sts the rules of N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the player to add another point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed them down , they pl@@ agu@@ ed down , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think as soon as we come up to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be magnificent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the U@@ CL@@ A will end their practices as soon as the camp is finished , as soon as the clear sea policy has been ej@@ ected , which is already ej@@ ected with foot@@ balls , which will be a protective mesh behind a door@@ man , no light object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brood @-@ players will occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a cleared a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we will use our security &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched that people can rent a room there and then adjust it to record a practice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have the video quality of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
so I don &apos;t need to worry too much .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts testing in the fight against counter@@ feit messages
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook wants to send more potential items with wrong messages to third parties and their results on Thursday , said the world &apos;s largest online social network . it is one of its efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake news . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said in a position on its website that is to begin with the use of updated machine learning methods , and to send them to fac@@ simile reviews , which may display results of the fac@@ simile check out of the original item . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook has been cri@@ tici@@ zed as one of the main objectives for so @-@ called F@@ ake news , many of which have also influenced the presidential elections in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem has become too big political issue in Europe with false declar@@ ations in May with false stories , and Germany will be endor@@ sed if it succe@@ eds to eliminate h@@ asser@@ ted post@@ ings just as before the elections in September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , Facebook spoke in a separate statement in German to start a test of the new facts review in the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the knowledge , which stories of fact vali@@ dated third parties , people want more to read about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product man@@ ag@@ erin for Facebook news in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook continues to test his feature to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and will be working on other changes to his news feed to reduce false news . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a Comic novel : a castle in the history of England
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his younger past , the Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 &quot; s and 1980 @-@ 1980 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Scot@@ ney has witnessed 700 years of turbul@@ ent history of its cozy seat in the valley of River Valley in K@@ ent and is now available for inspiration for a graphic novel of Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ ari@@ gen York@@ shire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families that lived in Scot@@ ia . each story was illustrated by a others who ruled by Isaac Ste@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith . William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not the first book by Rho@@ des , based on one archive : he wrote in 2014 &quot; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only have responded to the thumb@@ nail at the side of a letter so that was written by a double in the 1700 &quot; s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins . &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that is his thum@@ b pressure !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and letters will always sm@@ ite at smoke , because at that time a fire was lit up because of the light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the od@@ our has a effect as it would be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh , I love the archives ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for someone who works so with old papers , he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest , I think this seems too beautiful to be true . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rho@@ des spent his days to explore the Vict@@ orian , new &quot; castle , and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties to the castle , as they had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he walked through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle , saying with landscape care , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then at night he drank &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust was granted the full access in 2006 when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Rho@@ des met a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive , which he said as &quot; hundreds of years ago , &quot; Oh , ra@@ ined it on the attic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Empire , maps that would represent you that country conflict would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a pe@@ ar that fought two families . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
guys that go all his way ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to invite to a bro@@ ader base to the English story , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which leaves the newly built castle to join the peas@@ ant status of 13@@ 81 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is a record from a tur@@ mo@@ il that appeared in the castle 13@@ 80 in the castle with the title &apos; Kn@@ igh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; . &quot; says Rho@@ des .
&quot; the peas@@ ant started in this area and I thought a revol@@ t was a good start .
perhaps the two are connected ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the history of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ter that hidden the history of Dar@@ rell seven years during the British Reformation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , shown in the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rell of the 18th century , who filled his own fun@@ eral ( a discovery that was excav@@ ated only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dar@@ re@@ ll@@ s are Rho@@ des &apos;s family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentle@@ men seemed to be quite a look , getting back debt and spend money for things they could not afford . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men mar@@ ched their debt crises by taking rich old women , I place them as a pile of good looking guys , with a talent to adverti@@ se itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the end of his deployment in the castle , Rho@@ des in search of other unique writers experience &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has brought a two week stay in the Finnish court for a comic based on E@@ lä@@ ß@@ ma@@ ki over E@@ lä@@ ß@@ ma@@ ki over the early 20th century , which since then returned from nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back again . &quot; he said .
it was like : &quot; Ah ! I have to be ready again with the dam@@ n lives . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ bo chapel covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the unveil@@ ing of the 301 years old Mari@@ juana &apos;s in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the City of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started its campaign to launch a new umbrella brand ( Rundschau with Thursday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until Thursday , mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team led by Nelson Art@@ z to keep the logo and slogan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of August there will be a highlight of the campaign on the island Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th at the end of August .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or , &quot; ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t really think this ( of course ! ) don &apos;t really think about its website un@@ locked .
&quot; but we use this measure to gain your attention .
and to make clear that it is better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we are the firm belief that we know as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer to know the beauty and attra@@ c@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the action , it is going to say more than &quot; just &quot; a logo and slogan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s true to form@@ ulate a stand@@ alone promise that gives the city a distinctive element . &quot;
eventually they stood in competition with other commun@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f , the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will cost their new roof brand and the campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military reforms in Turkey - Earth &apos;s war@@ ms fear of the army
every year in early August Ankara the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) received over pen@@ sion@@ ings and promotions in the officers of officers .
so also this week .
at first sight a normal operation .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces a year after the attempt at Putin .
the session was not held in the building of the general Staff as before , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the presi@@ ding of government heads , the five vice @-@ presi@@ dents and the Minister for Defence , Interior , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in the number .
the military draws the re@@ ins to the military .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar stays in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the He@@ ber , the Air Force and the Navy were shut off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the failed coup the Erd@@ ogan &apos;s Erd@@ ogan 169 contain 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and ad@@ mir@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over 10,000 soldiers were removed from army ranks , mostly due to alleged ties to move the exile Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , Erd@@ ogan as a wire drawing of the coup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against 4@@ 86 persons , which should have been involved in the attempt at the coup attempt , is negoti@@ ated in Ankara since this week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the day after the coup , Erd@@ ogan himself referred to as &quot; divine call &quot; as he gives him the opportunity to clean the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erd@@ ogan really really grip the army ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet published an article entitled &quot; Dis@@ comfort in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the general staff belong to the increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the Army , which manifest itself among other things in the aboli@@ tion of the head@@ band ban for Sol@@ dat@@ ors , wrote the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the big cleaner in the army and the security forces continue to go further .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mid @-@ July Erd@@ ogan sent another 7@@ 3@@ 95 national police , among them 230@@ 3 police officers and 546 soldiers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus it seemed like the Erd@@ ogan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were earlier than the real gentle@@ men of the country .
three times they appe@@ aled to their role as guar@@ di@@ ans of the sec@@ ular state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after his election victory in 2002 , Erd@@ ogan stepped down the power of the military step , not least in appeal to the reform of the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
former officers say that Erd@@ ogan is aiming for an Islam@@ ization of the forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; Voc@@ al Europe &quot; a well @-@ called officer , who was trying to asylum seek@@ ed fears of persecution abroad in a few years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this is true , NATO could not leave Nato . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyway there is doubts about the operation of the Turkish army according to the pur@@ ges of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened by leadership and operational skills are &quot; weakened , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will give a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted from the media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he sees to reduce the legal immigrants to 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter regulations for temporary work permits and limitations for family oriented visa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ can and endor@@ sed by the President .
the bill will be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , save the wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will change that by the U.S. to change the way of citizens from other countries of Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chains migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this new candidate procedure will benefit the candidates who have the financial resources to support themselves and knowledge that our economy will benefit , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to re@@ write track for racing section shuttle
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few months over the future of the competition section , we have been cont@@ ested over the future - now it should go very quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the end of the year , the tourist train is scheduled to be built on the tourist train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to secure the future of the competition section , the course of the traffic authority must begin construction work on the route . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to continue and re@@ order the route Ilmenau @-@ Renn@@ weg , the country has especially been aware of the tourism key , &quot; announced the state Secretary of Klaus Sü@@ hl on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of maintenance of the route has risen to approximately 2.5 million euros .
from that sum the country falls 75 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the contract , on whose basis the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future , will definitely become final , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ministry and the south sho@@ ots are already emp@@ tied with the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the timet@@ able , the vehicles and the quality standards are thus negoti@@ ated , &quot; Sü@@ hl said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the Railway Company will be closed for a duration of eleven years .
the racing bike Shuttle will therefore be ordered separately on December 2017 .
the racing bike shuttle is a popular rail link between the train stations Ilmenau and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during a pilot plant in the past few months , it has been utilized by sufficient many people in order to re@@ order it in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the route is also very di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry about it
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as you thought it can &apos;t be crazy in 2017 , a new report about the technological developments in the field of sex robots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes . indeed .
sex robots are a big thing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) released a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , Professor of Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we have to start their Ascension seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
choose the eye color of the robot that select its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and type of finger@@ nail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people are happy about it , but the companies provide a lot of it and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; said Mr Shar@@ key in the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; modern S@@ exp@@ on@@ ppen have developed from its infl@@ atable partners to robots with a ret@@ ina , which feels warm - with aware human reactions that can be achieved through the artificial intelligence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the user can also adjust his robot corresponding to its beli@@ efs &quot; and select everything , from the eye color of the robot over the form of ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or the color of his finger@@ nails . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is still worried , as many robots have the &quot; person@@ alities &quot; to look like a step@@ ford woman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern soles have developed to robots with a ret@@ ina .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows for example to adapt their robots to the properties that find it eng@@ aging as for example . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then there is still the Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy Gold sex rob@@ otic with pre @-@ programmed person@@ alities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; that gives the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; adv@@ entu@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible . &quot; the site is war@@ med by True Compan@@ ion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so may she like what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she also has her mood during the day - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can be tired , fixed on conversation , or she can be &quot; in mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many wor@@ ries arising during this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace genuine human relationships - but the under@@ c@@ ages of rape - but den@@ ying a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( i.e. here : contradi@@ cted ) Far@@ rah .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on his website , true companion Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then not have Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy ? &apos; is it available on the website .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or simply just another sex toy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their formation and increasing refin@@ ement show somewhat dar@@ ker and lowering of our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission than an optional addition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the men will not stop sex robots , and while the FR@@ R noticed their rising popularity , it still remains at the edge of consumer culture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what was se@@ ep@@ ed from the mar@@ g@@ inal zones , in relation to the spirit of time , in which we live , are very instruc@@ tive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many people are not strange or ins@@ ulting , until the free market there are permission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is , however , a certain per@@ ver@@ ing that these highly developed sex robots are threatened in a time in which the rights of women are threatened with that in which she pra@@ ises to have sex in the White House . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most terrible aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the bond@@ woman &apos; ) are not the graphical pictures which has been worn out and the out@@ stretched eyes but how realistic this vision works .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the goal of this sex rob@@ otic system is to create a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( even with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their gro@@ wers want them to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , on the point when it comes to their &quot; person@@ alities &quot; , robots make no real women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you cannot separate or simply walk away from your companion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have no placement or background history , nothing to hin@@ ge on independence or anything , which could distur@@ b the imagination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other words : they are pleasing slaves .
or to express it in the phra@@ se of 2017 : ma@@ iden
Tr@@ ump big power ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney about the ep@@ it@@ ome of sound mind
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has become a stere@@ otype of the Tr@@ ump @-@ era that pol@@ arized the political spher@@ es that have pol@@ arized the US voters , even families in small @-@ format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around Christmas and Thanksgiving , there was newspapers in the USA newspapers of counsel how to deal with the hor@@ ror of Tr@@ ump breast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
let us put all of us in order to burst out our filters .
less not@@ icing has been able to bring power Tr@@ ump to families .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I chose this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ plated poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been with the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans in our family that has visited this week in New York . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she remin@@ ded me that the unity can have a powerful enemy to a common enemy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House everyone knows them , including rep@@ ubli@@ can relationship , with which she fought hard for politics , suddenly and on the same side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it falls to me in another context that this also brings considerable risks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Left Opposition was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the performing effect of his presidency has the power to push for us all right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the cre@@ epy possibility that his b@@ itt@@ ens will no longer be driven out of one day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is a still @-@ like long @-@ term scenario , norm@@ alized in the Tr@@ ump Repub@@ lic@@ ans of the right wing , which suddenly appear in comparison to his standards as the ep@@ it@@ ome of sin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I find myself nowadays from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney - the dog on the car roof that the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax declaration found ) - which is in fact a very mild crimin@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Tr@@ ump falls , the next candidate of the Republi@@ can must be mentally healthy to qualify as an unwanted improvement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when my c@@ ousin were in town , we brought our children to the car@@ ou@@ sel in Central Park , the largest of the New York branch department , and the best three dollars that one can spend in the city when there is no caffeine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all the c@@ low@@ ns are cra@@ ft@@ y and the animals spin around to face their own shoulders - extremely dark and the eclip@@ sing music creates a strange way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint one city : the views of tall buildings are old , the sky@@ lines are to be trusted , and the reality of the city becomes not just the dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thirty five years later , and I still did not stay over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub ye Ol@@ de Swiss cottage isn &apos;t - but a large roundabout in northern London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but central park @-@ car@@ ou@@ sel is still a strange magical experience , since here two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 &apos;s can go on it and all have a great time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I could have rate the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one was asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , I was forced to rate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars , before I could pass through my credit card . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coffee house on the corner of my street , it is the same , plus the option to counter with a 15 % tip - this to something about the counter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what is actually a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation in which no need is required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the poor woman in the department store exc@@ la@@ zing , while I tired the experience to submit my credit card with five stars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred with chest pain from prison to the hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us again left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , he was taken to the hospital for the treatment of schn@@ apps to his wrist and suffered from prison according to a fall in his cell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence due to murder after an appeal of pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ors .
he slew Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by giving them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ toria on it .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he kept his friend for a noc@@ tur@@ nal int@@ ru@@ der who was hiding in the cabin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to insert this time against the six @-@ year jail term of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ eal , from whom they say , they may be transparent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Law En@@ forcement , said that it will rise to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the ob@@ jection could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us runs danger that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer Arnold can find a strange egg
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last of the Blum@@ berger schools were given the districts of Fe@@ eding and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen in the holidays , and were released in secondary schools . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
three of the students will in the future go to high school and four on the secondary school .
school manager Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Ci@@ es@@ ental family in E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 29 pupils of the four grades led by Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der elected a young eagle , who is growing in the chick@@ ens , but then released into freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to this the m@@ lower Sch@@ ar led a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle in the T@@ erh@@ of of . &quot;
farmer Arnold found a curious egg and left it from his chick@@ ens .
instead of a chicken king a little eag@@ les came out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the hope to make out of him a chicken , the eagle spread on a high mountain , and de@@ hum@@ ed his wings on a high mountain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after this the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young Go@@ ck@@ eln , the cylinders bore to the bet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the eag@@ les stand for the integration . he said the man@@ ager@@ ess Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the young is different from the other young animals ( ch@@ icks ) , but belong to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he never will be like a chicken .
its dest@@ iny is to be free .
they wished every quad@@ ru@@ kl@@ ed that he feels accepted in his new school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was followed by thank@@ sgiving to the colleagues , the previous school manager Michael Müller , who starts again when direc@@ ting the parents and the parents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ch@@ ken@@ nel is now over , explained the class teacher Sophia Schumacher .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she met her students after two years of teaching , because it had been a really great time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally they can rely on the qu@@ il@@ kl@@ ers .
at the end all students have a song of summer time and holiday season .
there was great joy with the children .
eight original kl@@ ers already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned in Greece for illegal Camp@@ ings , distributed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted by television . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the morning of 1 August , in Si@@ th@@ onia , the police arrested a group of illegal confin@@ ed people , including the two Bulgarian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the same day , she was released as currently an investigation is underway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Foreign Office reported that the Bulg@@ arians have been released later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Greek authorities have gra@@ sp@@ ed control of the free camp , and lay in every one who is found to stay in a place which is not intended for this purpose , substantial sur@@ pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
checks are continued throughout the whole season .
the ministry said that the Court can be hang@@ ed .
software update for diesel vehicles : what the people do now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
have diesel drivers to participate in the action ?
an overview of the most important questions and answers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the diesel @-@ summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for about 5,@@ 3 million cars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are supposed to comply with the emission of emission of Euro 5 and 6 Euro 6 emissions .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ diesel or less are excluded from it .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin of ACE Car Club Europe estimates :
is the new promotion committed ?
no . the tra@@ ded software updates are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates are only valid for the vehicles , the Sch@@ um@@ mel@@ anin , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unit &apos;s retro@@ fitting is arranged at the Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the manufacturers have announced a quick implementation in the next few months , but still not called the exact date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler has given us to write every person concerned .
if anyway an inspection is due . I &apos;ll do it in their context .
how long did the change cut off ?
&quot; difficult to say &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
the relation to the engagement of manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturers are not acting on the environment so far . &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the conversion itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
time consuming can be an appointment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what do mot@@ orists do , who don &apos;t drive a car of BMW , Daimler , Opel and the Volkswagen Group ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ACE will refuse to wait .
probably foreign manufacturers would trace then S@@ met@@ anin .
is a massive pay of Euro @-@ 4 cars now threat@@ ening ?
the ACE will be afraid .
but in the regions where passengers are dro@@ pping .
there is no value loss for older diesel in rural areas so far .
the ACE will av@@ ail off with a sale yet .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the glam@@ orous events in Washington .
the first prize awar@@ ding to President Tr@@ ump promises to be politically .
one of the winners does not want to come - from protest .
LL Cool J ( 49 ) is the first character of the prestigious awards of the renowned Kennedy Center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the cultural institution on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ograph@@ ers Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman L@@ ear ( 95 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the awards will be presented at the beginning of December .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditionally , US president Donald Tr@@ ump will stage a reception and take part in the award with his wife Mel@@ ania . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award winner announced with progressive TV series , therefore already announced to abst@@ ain from entering the gala . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this presidency has decided to completely negle@@ ct the arts and human rights - even the funds - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump , in order to make their view clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the former president John F. Kennedy , Kennedy @-@ Center is the largest cultural institution in the US capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the former winners , Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ as Franklin , Robert De N@@ iro , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we make the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs &apos;s car@@ et@@ aker and goes into pension next year .
the place is already written - suitable candidates are ra@@ r .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister since 31 years .
and the work always makes it great fun as he was medi@@ ated in the press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reports from varied , but also demanding tasks that wait for his successor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time it mar@@ vel at the same time no application for the requirement profile fulfil@@ ment so far .
the city looks for the next possible time an architect or engineer .
thus - having regard to regular basis periods - still sufficient time for having to develop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because Has@@ lach works for the administrative community as a lower authority , the applicants must be prec@@ ari@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this function will definitely keep the city .
would they no longer be able to fill it out if you would need to go to Offen@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the city &apos;s proximity to the city and himself is important , says W@@ acker that tells of a good working climate as well as good mood between authority and citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated and looks back with pride . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; he is sure of the office department and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there are also diversi@@ fied projects on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the precip@@ itation parking is about .
the little bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed and the st@@ adi@@ ums is still subject matter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter alone will strike at a book of about 1.5 million euros , &quot; when we make it right , W@@ acker estimates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all great tasks await my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
designed for a city building master of large games .
with ha@@ sten@@ ch &apos;s own building yard and gar@@ dener can be very flexible in many ways .
&quot; you can make a lot of moving &quot; h@@ ack@@ ers &quot; and the design of the green spaces are often praised by citizens and visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the old town is as a monument under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye to be approved , &quot; when new buildings can be approved , empha@@ sizes the separ@@ ating city building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyway the city builder is in high responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end , everything runs over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with care and coordination he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Building constructions ) has been present for ten years with Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) since 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also says that his successor is long , says W@@ acker : &quot; we &apos;re looking for someone who really identify and remain with the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because continuity is not only important for a good business climate , but also for the further design of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to study Roland W@@ acker , to present a closed studies as a diploma engineer or bach@@ elor with specialized architecture and have good knowledge in the areas of construction and construction planning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; urban construc@@ tional and civil engineering , construction of building planning , housing estate , municipal property building with building yard and housing estate , including monument protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bicycle on lines cast : blocked off the southern route
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the police , previously unknown offen@@ ders had the blue bicycle from rail track over@@ rides in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener road ( B@@ 116 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these were so heavily damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the heir led by two mas@@ cul@@ ts and seek them for the night time .
near the crime scene there were witnesses of a ro@@ oming sco@@ oter and a bike cycl@@ ist had been observed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that goes far beyond a Laus@@ itzer Prize , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpet@@ r@@ ator would have brought itself into great danger even , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the damage to the Lo@@ k and the plant , as well as the delayed @-@ minute crossing and the costs of railway customers could come to the offen@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was a total of a &quot; considerable &quot; sum , the speaker said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south railway line could be guided without any disability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost ten people were vac@@ ated on Friday afternoon and two of them were looking for the ferry traffic .
but did not count Güter@@ slo@@ gan@@ s but they had a delay .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch we had to change some 200 meters of the top lines .
ins@@ ul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to alle@@ vi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflam@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel diseases )
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a night@@ mare .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflam@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel diseases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incur@@ able condition that affects approximately 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom , causes mag@@ nit@@ ude and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ ring or bloody attacks , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the suffer@@ ers usually come to avoid meat and dairy products , researchers found the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an of proteins that helps to develop immun@@ ity , which promotes a toler@@ ant intestinal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the executive researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immune cells in the intest@@ ine pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that are hidden in the food , do not enter the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cells that are able to trigger inflammation , are compens@@ ated by cells which promote tolerance and protect the body without sensitive tissues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the balance is too far in direction to inflammation , this can result in a inflam@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in experiments , it has been noted that a type of tolerance to promote immune cell cells occurs in mice that have a certain bacter@@ ium in its bow@@ els . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus re@@ uter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ al , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an had mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he suggested that the combination of L. re@@ uter@@ i and one an tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an rich diet toler@@ ates more infl@@ amed bo@@ wel , if the same system assi@@ sts with people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Post@@ doctoral Pri@@ zes in Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan was investig@@ ating a kind of immun@@ ity that resulted in a group of study mice , but a different group of the same tri@@ bal , but it was not separate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it suggested that the difference with the gut micro@@ bi@@ al of mice had - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i who normally live in the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal Tra@@ ct . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the mice of mice were sequ@@ enced in DNA and were found six bacterial species that were present in mice with the immune cells but without them missing the mice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mice were treated in a ster@@ ile environment , so they did not develop a gut micro@@ bi@@ om and they did not develop this kind of immune cells and they received the L. re@@ uter@@ i and immune cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to understand how the bacteria hop@@ ed on the immune system , researchers placed L. re@@ uter@@ i in a liquid and then brought small amounts of the fluid - without the bacteria , isolated from mice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immune cells developed to toler@@ ate cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the active component was cleansed from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an metabolism which is known as the i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an in the food of the mice , whereas the number of cells were hal@@ ved around 50 per cent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same toler@@ ant cells like mice , and that the majority of us L. re@@ uter@@ i protect from our g@@ astro @-@ intestinal Tra@@ p . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an @-@ by @-@ products from L. re@@ uter@@ i has developed the cells in humans like in mice but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an were found in people with anti @-@ inflam@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel diseases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; The development of these cells is probably something that we would like to promote inflam@@ mations on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially can lead high tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an values in the presence of L. re@@ uter@@ i to wi@@ dening this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has comm@@ ited a &quot; Gen@@ ie &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , &quot; Gen@@ ie &quot; was signed with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut on Wednesday evening his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 40 million pounds of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre@@ season game before the UEFA @-@ super @-@ Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed with expos@@ ures as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , M@@ atic was excluded from the prepar@@ atory @-@ Asia tour of the blues , abol@@ ished only 45 minutes to improve M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , that he had to improve before the Premier League season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Boeing &quot; malt &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the US @-@ plane manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pilots flew from Seattle to US state of Washington , but drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan and attracted many thousands of kilometers in the form of a Dream@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
to the radar monitors the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising .
thus the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing @-@ logo was painted in the sky .
new draft for Martin Schulz - Hannover - we have a problem
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the wind turns , as Sig@@ mar Gabriel was yet the SPD boss , the president of the S &amp; D Presidency was looking ahead with a certain concern to Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; merely no stor@@ y@@ ards from the party central , merely not a head@@ wind of the wai@@ st@@ band - so the most important desire of the election campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Martin Schulz has not changed the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , the employees from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus has grown growing with growing discover@@ ies in the SPD @-@ ruling state capit@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which Schulz from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described in the approach with the return . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were lows .
and that one after the other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CDU sees a general signal against the coalition of the SPD and the Green . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that shows once more : red @-@ green is simply not too reliable to negoti@@ ate . &quot; said the CDU Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the surprising changes in a Green M@@ EPs took the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; five months before the parliamentary elections , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from the CDU and F@@ DP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Green French President Michael Kell@@ ner encouraged her mand@@ ated , Lower Saxony @-@ MEP El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests to rep@@ urch@@ ase your mandate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the super@@ imposed on the CDU means a clear corruption of the voters .
El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jack@@ ets has to immediately give back its mandate and said to the German Managing Director and election campaign of the Green editorial network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; si@@ gh a SPD election campaign , as on Friday morning the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ message had reached the party central . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Weil , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony is standing up to the CDU without his own government of government after over@@ ride the Green M@@ EPs in El@@ ke T@@ est .
it is the preliminary highlight of a total number of large and small crises in the SPD @-@ country associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the mis@@ ery began with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland @-@ election in March .
a blue eye don &apos;t cal@@ med down the comra@@ des of the back time .
after the state elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia everything will be different .
it was then - and that everything was clearly worse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the Tau@@ ern , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite broke the party until smooth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comra@@ des over@@ turned again in the weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then when they had sli@@ pped new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and with him the next stop came .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mayor O@@ la@@ f Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD leadership , lost his Nim@@ bus at that weekend , because he was in the el@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and because in the crisis communication , he made quite wrong in the crisis communication , what you can do wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then Sch@@ olz fights for political survival .
so now Stephan Weil passed .
because of the VW @-@ exhaust air and its role in the Supervisory Board the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony have already existed in criticism .
mi@@ ese Re@@ quest added to this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyway , or perhaps , because in recent weeks , because in recent weeks , Weil tried to set acc@@ ents in the league . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the endeav@@ or of the former Mayor of Hannover to expand his power in Berlin , there was also no conc@@ e@@ aled about Martin Schulz &apos;s environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they allow him to grant him because they had a stabil@@ iser of the party .
now the exact opposite could occur .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this , because of the parti@@ sans of the Lower Saxony , the Lower Saxony is no guilt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and Martin is not at all .
sometimes the comra@@ des we@@ eding to keep their own ranks close .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their anger is directed to the green@@ ery , and especially to the ab@@ ins@@ ular par@@ liament@@ arians in the v@@ ests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is int@@ ol@@ erable and democratic thinking about the interests of all the others . &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the party leaders in the SPD Parliamentary Group , the German editorial network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; woman T@@ v@@ ests is not chosen because of her person as a direct candidate , but on the national list of the Lower Saxony . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns to her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , boss of the SPD Parliamentary Group is compl@@ aining a &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver &quot; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the v@@ oter turn@@ out four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Weil handed over to the Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the national candidate to the national election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann continued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he requested to clari@@ fy the backgrounds .
I want to know if there has been more or continued operations of the CDU of Lower Saxony .
support funds for villages III
those who want to stay in the years would be able to get support from the country soon .
on the informed mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives St@@ eg Urban Development on Wednesday in sensa@@ tions .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ ind@@ ler gave a look back at what happened so far .
since 1991 it has been in sensa@@ tional restoration areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then , in the restoration of the I from 1991 to 2004 , the state Baden @-@ Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding amount . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 the supplement was still 60 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous re@@ treats will be a &quot; success project &quot; - it &apos;s important to fo@@ ster the interior design and not only develop new construction areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on April 4 the information from the Government of Karlsruhe will receive the information that there will be a san@@ i field III .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the funding amount is 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which 500 000 euros in the country , the rest of the municipality of sensation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how is a san@@ itation area created ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will continue to investigate as Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there is also a role whether in the planned area at all concern , to san@@ itation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
may the territ@@ orial boundaries could be post@@ pon@@ ed again .
the jet@@ ty on Wednesday evening Martin Keller and Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cell@@ ars presented the contents of the federal state program &quot; Social City , &quot; which would then be carried out as part of the refurb@@ ishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the core of the program are re@@ vit@@ alization of internal cities , improving living and working conditions , and maintain infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the measures would be occupied by means of objects which means each property .
the rehabilitation zone would finally define as a stat@@ ute .
the eligi@@ bility period for the funding period has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however until September this year , once again the inventory was carried out , within the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation zone they would have completed a questionna@@ ire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in November or December , as possible , the deadline is scheduled to begin next year with the re@@ treats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that every municipality had to carry out the said pre @-@ tests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is therefore to evaluate the urban mis@@ ery and to decide when it is re@@ group@@ ed , and in which scope . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a renovation is included in the basic book for the property .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann can come again by emotion , and make a picture of the situation , promised them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Got@@ zel stressed : involvement in the project is an essential success factor for the project .
therefore there will be questionna@@ ires which will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled up until the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionna@@ ire is the &quot; building and land @-@ site , &quot; with which it goes among other things around the construction and restoration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in grey questionna@@ ire , &quot; budget and homes , &quot; information on size , distribution and residents of a living room can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the blue &quot; operating bow &quot; can only be filled if in the building business spaces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , please notice that Got@@ zel showed that a filled questionna@@ ire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new construc@@ ts are not condu@@ ci@@ ve to promote .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler still stressed that the distribution of funding after the &quot; wind @-@ dog principle &quot; work - who first comes first .
you can &apos;t reserve subsi@@ dies for later . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end , photos of the project &quot; Ort@@ se@@ wers II &quot; were shown in order to make the present a renovation &quot; tasty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor is himself a micro@@ chip to move with a hand movement in house and car
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a British inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his office door and can even run his car with a hand movement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ b and index finger and now offers the service to businesses and individuals who wish to simplify their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Tea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory Ana@@ es@@ th@@ esi@@ sten in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the im@@ plant procedure is carried out after medical standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the technology re@@ sembles a cat and dogs im@@ pl@@ anti@@ ated micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the firm of Mr. North@@ am would also like to change locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for an extra charge of £ 300 per lock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the married father of one has now built up both at home and with his BMW Z4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the helm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the advertising expenses of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House decision , a na@@ vy @-@ helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers to be left over the last month , tax@@ pay@@ ers up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One if the president is on board the heart of the event on July 17 at the White House with American construction programs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of all 50 countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the helicopter designed in Connec@@ tic@@ ut was issued next to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a Fire@@ man from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft made from Mississi@@ ppi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , after the record of the Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , which is responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted that you are aware of it because it is an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the Commander of H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of his pre@@ set , the Deputy Marin@@ ek@@ om@@ man@@ de@@ ur for aer@@ ospace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message showed that the helicopter was at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 o &apos;clock , and so long stayed until the lawn was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note that if your flight should be delayed from the White House , the second crew would require a second crew for return flight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original air crew was during the event , while the security personnel continued during the time on the floor standing by plane . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the records provided for the TIM@@ E were not clear , whether ultimately , a second flight number was necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal states to use state property for political purposes .
data sets show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 might be asked if the event might hurt the determination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question that we put , was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch acts and were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked . &quot; the Deputy Command@@ ant .
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated as an official event by the White House and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the event , the president gave a stum@@ bling block for reform of health reform , which was underway in the Senate and propag@@ ated the effort to reduce government rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of an aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon from politically beneficial purposes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
presi@@ dents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump brought an investigation into the background of his first Camp@@ agn@@ en@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , Ta@@ xi@@ services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that are compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential plane . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is inspired by the Show &quot; Made In America &quot; - products from all 50 countries that are manufactured by American workers with American materials , &quot; said vice @-@ president of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently lead training flights in the area around Washington , and in the South La@@ wn through to susp@@ end the US President in the White House with precise cen@@ tim@@ eter@@ ms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a dr@@ ump in early July at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 was in the White House 58 exercise land@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; event attracted by the crew &apos;s training requirements for the month , &quot; a official said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units flew additionally 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ Presi@@ dential supporters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers were not introduced to any of the other pro@@ ps , presented at the event . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ man for S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved in this helicopter to put the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget drawings for the presidential flights , and it &apos;s difficult to identify the exact cost for the event . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the US Ministry of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the DO@@ D reimbur@@ sement for the V@@ H @-@ 3D however is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the native of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House argu@@ ed that the actual cost for the operation of the helicopter is far under this rate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers to the basis of estimates for the refund of estimates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it estimates staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual means . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the costs of DO@@ D will not include personnel costs , but consider the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract completion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that time the former press Officer of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present these week things , which are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the State of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud to contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I think like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which many Americans have in@@ ti@@ relessly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is of course reasonable to highlight the image . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not clear when Tr@@ ump with Hel@@ icop@@ ter was inter@@ ned when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and sh@@ attered about his own fleet of company products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very well &quot; said the president &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of a tricky task

the TC Blue @-@ White Ne@@ uss will begin tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel in the Tab@@ ulated Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite five games still fla@@ ir balance , the leader of the second Tennis Bundes@@ liga has won the sense of reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
team leader Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has certainly respect for the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation .
just on the back positions I find the crew very well . &quot;

&quot; this is how it is difficult for us .
you also need a good portion of luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ uss@@ er crew for the trip in the high north is imp@@ rac@@ tical .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give maximum jan@@ itors four .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , at the moment the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella does not manage the Bundes@@ liga game , which comes to the tournament at Czech Liber@@ ec playing Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) at its debut in this season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday , the Chil@@ ene Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the Bel@@ ar@@ rus@@ sen attacks yesterday at the ATP @-@ tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was still the number one of the Junior World ranking in January 2016 , anyone from the train@@ ab to Mari@@ us Z@@ ay fills the ca@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how America could harm the O@@ MV
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really happy , Donald Tr@@ ump did not work when he placed his signature under the law for the intensi@@ fication of sanctions against Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his H@@ ast to adopt the law , Congress was un@@ wrapped in a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels bar@@ ked against the inf@@ rin@@ gement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least , the draft stipul@@ ates European companies who help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines into the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , investors have been co @-@ funded by domestic O@@ MV , co @-@ funded by the Russian Baltic Sea line Nord Stream 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the drug is tremendous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , it was too early for an estimate of consequences , so the official statement of the oil group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump needs to raise the sanctions even by an executive order to life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
twelve weapons are there to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press has looked at which the group could refuse , and which could really be done to him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nar@@ cos Season 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is located in the centre of Net@@ fli@@ x . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars Killer has been revealed , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is not yet over . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the seasons three and four were already confirmed by streaming service , the first received its first trailer and showed the latest vil@@ la@@ ins of the show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the third season , D@@ EA has directed its attention to the world &apos;s richest organisation in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; led by four powerful paper@@ work , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company , &quot; with more government and violent actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ guez O@@ re@@ ju@@ ela ( Damian Al@@ ca@@ zar ) is the leader of the map , Miguel Rodri@@ guez O@@ re@@ ju@@ ela ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the newly released trailer , Pedro Pascal and Javier Pe@@ ña turns back to inviting the war against drugs to support the war against drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Role backwards : the City represents 46 S@@ ai@@ ds
the city organizes the k@@ itt@@ a @-@ lun@@ cal again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with fixed contact persons for children , and one assigned to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the municipal child@@ care centres the clock will be turned back .
on the 1st of September the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food safety in the urban kinder@@ garten equipment ( Kit@@ as ) again in your own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz , deputy head of the welfare department , this is good news : &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cooked besides the house : a cat@@ erer will take care of this task , providing fresh cooked ch@@ illed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city operates in the Kre@@ feld district of 46 kinder@@ garten sites , in 44 children get a warm meal at lunch time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past financial year 2800 children were sitting at the tables and the demand is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , we do not only eat children , the 45 hours of week@@ days , at mid@@ day , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this offer also applies to the 35 @-@ hour supervision when children stay up to 14 hrs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 46 participating teachers from 1st September service : they warm up the delivered food , complement the salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individually , give meals , rinse and clean the kitchen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the workers are assigned to a kit@@ a &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz .
the size - there are two group@@ ings as well as se@@ clu@@ ded facilities - decides over the ho@@ ur@@ able volume .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now firm to the Kit@@ a team , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are much more efficient , and it is easier to implement educational concepts for the kit@@ ten lines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because it matters : healthy food and cooking lessons .
&quot; children should help to prepare meals . &quot;
direct connection to the kitchen power to the team is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have a well @-@ known power in the kit@@ a , a person who is familiar to them , and not changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the pur@@ ge of the itt@@ a rooms - so far the task of the kitchen forces - will in future be done by special cleaning personnel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this variation - separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , which it has provided for the city as the most economical offer , is it from the press office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that even though 46 partial forces are new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so strong at around 750 people in the education sector , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nicholas Hay@@ ek , official head of the UN mission , said that hundreds of women are can@@ alization in the provinces in the provinces . three women are presi@@ ding for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated . &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections can only be really representative and credible if women participate in@@ correctly , in all parts of the election process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Taliban has released threats against an election process , which coinci@@ ded with the transition of international fighting in an advisory role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , elections are handed down peac@@ efully for the first time by a democra@@ tically elected government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ som said that a strong role for women is expected to strengthen Afghanistan &apos;s democratic success .
Afghan independent voting committee reported that 1.2 million women registered in a total of 3.6 million voters were registered .

two young men at the age of 19 and 23 should have tried on Thursday to depri@@ ve a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the police , the men , the 13 @-@ year @-@ old , held up with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße , at 14.@@ 55 h , because they wanted to call with the girl &apos;s mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request and went further with their friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subsequently , one of the offen@@ ders tried to sei@@ ze the cell phone and the necklace of the girl . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

G@@ MB @-@ concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union would like to engage in Man@@ ag@@ ern from the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie over long @-@ term commitment to production in her work in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company has kept silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the plant that manufactures plan@@ ne@@ bs and Rich Tea bis@@ cuits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owners Platinum , he invested more than 5 million pounds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives were &quot; first experienced , &quot; if they would change their activities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the branches of the company G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s , &quot; concern to express that the financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be driven forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ Organis@@ ator Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , affecting our members . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generations of families have worked here and labour power focus on the local community and the major Glasgow , an important pillar for decent jobs in an area with high unemployment and social dis@@ adv@@ anta@@ geous situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , under the prosp@@ ect of jobs , wage and prosperity , and before the back@@ drop of the Bre@@ xit , the eastern end of Glasgow strongly urg@@ ently needed a flor@@ ent production &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Spe@@ aker of Pla@@ di said : &quot; the branch of stores at T@@ oll@@ cross had only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to it as we appreciate the continuous commitment in employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross where some questions were discussed openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we talked to our employees that we operate in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to stay competitive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds , particularly in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recognize the inheritance of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility and fully . should our operations change at the location , employees and their trade union representatives should be the first to learn this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years ago before N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the Site of La League may wish her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not leave in its persecution of £ 189 million in order to trigger an offer of £ 189 million , but have warned Barcelona three years before the world record . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sensa@@ tional approach has been heated in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the World Record for more than double the previous mark , taking Paul Pog@@ ba during the last season for 89 million pounds of Manchester United . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following the completion , N@@ ey@@ mar will pay for the most expensive professionals in the world and for highly paid professional athletes . PS@@ G will pay for more than 500.000 GBP a week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious over the way where N@@ ey@@ mar has made his way home out , although a source in the proximity of the Catal@@ ans insi@@ sted that the club has always made his best since his arrival from Santos in 2013 to take care of him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the football world was warned of that prosp@@ ect three years ago from the PS@@ G President ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a Manchester City 2014 interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di , Nasser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any club who wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not worried about because they touch one of our players , then we will contact them in opposition , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players at yourself , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , whereby the Spanish association expressed interest in the PS@@ G @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PS@@ G made clear that they would not allow it to go to the International out of Italy in any circumstances , and Barcelona was able to view the consequences of that intervention by giving one of her discounts for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because a car returned to his passenger lane , the driver had to depart from a VW tour and touch@@ ingly the guiding line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the driver of the coming passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ hau@@ led a truck and continued its way around the traffic accident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

interview : &quot; Dom@@ en@@ atzen report for@@ ged Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Rainbow Dom@@ en@@ ching report on the abuse of abuse pop@@ ularly un@@ loaded Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
the author and historian Michael H@@ es@@ emann mean .
the final report of the ab@@ using sc@@ andal at the rh@@ yo@@ j@@ ab pads provides further discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Christian Weis@@ sen@@ ator , spokesperson for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; according to the German press agency , he anticipated by the former Rain@@ fall Bishop and today &apos;s Cardinal Gerhard R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an exc@@ use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would very serve to see the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would like to express their deepest emotions from their own sub@@ du@@ ings or their back false assessment of the processes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by contrast , the Vatican Museums , Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , on the other hand , critic@@ ised that during the reporting of violence at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the attacks in Regensburg , no one knows that it would have to be punished . but the &quot; degree medi@@ al manipulation &quot; was consp@@ ic@@ uous by the &quot; degree medi@@ al manipulation , &quot; thus the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the custom@@ ary , the Catholic Church as a source of all exercises , is already part of everyday experience and preparing the public opinion that for normal , writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk , Für@@ sten@@ n Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said : &quot; we are happy to go to the Church and that is a spot@@ ted Fres@@ sen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it proved to be a quite normal ped@@ ago@@ gic way in her youth , &quot; in order to be ready with fre@@ ak children as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you find it un@@ fair to contact today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , because the world has changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse , Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appears often . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; totally wrong , author and historian Michael H@@ es@@ emann , who translated with R@@ atz@@ inger the &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says H@@ es@@ emann , because all this had nothing to do with him , he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is there in the 440 @-@ page report written by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg in Regensburg with the En@@ lighten@@ ment lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , a total of 5@@ 47 rain@@ bows have been ab@@ used with high plau@@ sibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final report it says to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 , so that from Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases relate physical and mental violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just with high E@@ mot@@ ion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could be more intense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to numerous other accus@@ ations , many victims of the general crimes of R. was estimated and therefore , in numerous cases , even positive memories came with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interview H@@ es@@ emann explains why the final report for the abuse of abuse Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was reli@@ eved of his opinion .
Mr. H@@ es@@ emann , the 440 @-@ site report on the inci@@ dents of non @-@ violence against guar@@ di@@ aries . there is a contra@@ dic@@ tory picture from Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
a lift up many students . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for others , he appears also as a ch@@ ol@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist who was hand @-@ enhancing that the Ö@@ f@@ teren had no top performance musi@@ cally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can you evaluate it as his bi@@ ogra@@ pher ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : when one reads and read all the 440 pages long from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appears in it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is dedicated to him just eight pages , and he is clear acquitted of every sus@@ pic@@ ion of the medi@@ ator or ro@@ ser@@ en@@ ity of the terrible cases of sexual abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the violence of violence at the pre@@ school took place outside its sphere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can fore@@ see him at all , about it too late , or take first shots taken seriously enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from practically all respon@@ dents than - as literally - &quot; salvation , &quot; heaven , &quot; and &quot; better world , &quot; was perceived by practically all respon@@ dents than - literally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of his student Georg R@@ atz@@ inger explains a very excellent witness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very well @-@ committed teacher who provided the boys regularly with cakes , cookies and Bon@@ b@@ ons and &quot; always moved from grapes from children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only a minority compl@@ ained about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and high en@@ mot@@ ional , which also led to W@@ ut@@ aus@@ sia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he didn &apos;t throw only with chairs and threw the key@@ chain on the ground , but also ear@@ ching guys at the hair or ears he has already de@@ pl@@ eted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , to his arm@@ ament , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the frac@@ tional period , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents as in teachers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you still know such varieties ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , I think each of us who was born before 1968 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I also experienced this in a world@@ ly school in a state school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared to what it actually goes in this report , namely the frag@@ mentary sexual abuse and the violence of violence on the pre@@ school , they are certainly Bag@@ at@@ ellen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , one asks oneself if it did not work with his awareness and his role as brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media just fell on him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the bay@@ on@@ ous Pope , many people who never understood him were still eag@@ erly awa@@ ited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the truth is : the report expos@@ es Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the media , the report was reported in a lot about the topic mis@@ use of the rh@@ yo@@ j@@ ab pads . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also put a burden on the burden of abuse on sexual abuse in the final report ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : clearly no .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults to be entrusted to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to speak with my father or mother to talk about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said an officer of the others , &quot; It was all very embar@@ rass@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real problem in inform@@ ing sexual abuse was , and yet is that most victims are silent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she did not trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then not a ch@@ orus that would have been a collector of the perpet@@ r@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do the j@@ ab pads of R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : a question@@ able student formulated it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he could have had his right knowledge ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) and could have been able to stop the respective do@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; I think it ... also for really absurd , accept that it imp@@ acted ... Bu@@ ben int@@ ru@@ sive or more clear or rather re@@ opened as compared to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ s@@ aries , trust teachers , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ th@@ ink@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; in advance concerned students and / or their environment , could not be confirmed in the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what affects sexual abuse is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger so far from any involvement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he cannot be thrown , nor prevented him , or have brought him to the ad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , there is no reason to get his good name with these contra@@ dic@@ apped crime , as it happened in some cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the media had a lot of &quot; Viol@@ ence &quot; at the Palace of the Palace .
the former dom@@ eter champion Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will be thrown into the report .
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : this is the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and confused with a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is once again a mis@@ use of the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it is clean separately : between the pre@@ school and the gym@@ nasi@@ um of the cathedral , between sexual abuse and violence , we say once , other accus@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , the report deals with the time inci@@ dents from the period since 1945 , so Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the leader of the cathedral spar@@ row . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire aw@@ ful test pedagog@@ y , the cases , in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers have been lying and painted , all happened at the pre@@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous states have to be ruled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but with them , George R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do with those , because he did not get the boys to the face when they were already on the premises in the domain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on what was , like most of the witnesses , the topic of &quot; pre@@ school &quot; tab@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one was only happy to be escaped , and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what was different on the premises of the domain ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : there was indeed some discipline but no sa@@ di@@ ous violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims &quot; ass@@ ess@@ ments the general humanity of R. assessed , and therefore even positive memories with him in numerous cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so nobody remains at the best to have looked away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the conditions on the pre@@ school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first time 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish and was in charge of the events at a school , where he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) would not hear anything , and then again about 1993 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently conc@@ ede the ears ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ inion School . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this he shows this way that in the pre@@ school continues to be practiced in the test . &quot;
in view of the danger of negative press lines he recommended urgent action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was , of course , a point of clarity that had been banned in Bavaria as a test pun@@ ishments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before that she happened in a legal gray area as each of us is still white .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was also hard to estimate for him , where the affected might have been over@@ driven or dra@@ mati@@ zed , where really the allowed limit has been exceeded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you can &apos;t say that he would have been put away .
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 the exam@@ ining punishment of schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ oria , Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis claimed that it was un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s pedagog@@ ical standards at the time of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you see that ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : we are talking hist@@ ori@@ ans here from the &quot; Fall@@ out of A@@ la@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; thus the danger to evaluate today &apos;s moral standards .
the princess is right there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this of course does not apply to sexual abuse , which was abom@@ in@@ able to all times , and also not for what was corrupt in pre@@ school@@ ing and violence against innocent children &apos;s hearts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s all very horri@@ ble and I &apos;m glad we finally get up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but at the same time , I need to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his means for the discipl@@ ines and punishment , i.e. ear@@ ching and ears to hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when physical punishment was forbidden , it was also strictly forbidden . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what picture of his rainy day , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger took part in the talks with you for the book &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does the issue of Test came to speak as well ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XV@@ I. tells from its perspective that the cathedral spar@@ rows were only a part . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless I am not at all that he led to a stric@@ ter regim@@ ent there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but even this has to be said , without having made un@@ conditional discipline , it would probably not have been possible to form a national bi@@ sp@@ ies of Europe and its musical tradition that went twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with bis@@ cuits and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , one does not only make a great singer and a success , just in which area , but still discipline , passion and self @-@ over@@ coming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
than what kind of people did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger on convers@@ ations about her book ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond that I have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and always experienced as wonderful , hum@@ orous , basic , deeply believ@@ ing that he could not imagine in a fly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am receiving a regular basis as many former domains today , 23 years after his em@@ eri@@ zation while visiting it regularly - he is almost blind - and to treat him as a member of their family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who did not forgive him until now , that he once was strictly to them , are clearly in the minority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the cathedral spar@@ rows are thank@@ ful to him , that he has enriched her life and has communicated to them the world of music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that he always was a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly that may be - but still a lov@@ able respect , to which she is still looking to honour them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and please , again , quite clearly : everything you throw away from him are educational methods that were at the time on the agenda . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we can be glad that we have long overcome this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is un@@ just un@@ fair , a man only because it is promin@@ ently and has a famous brother to make medi@@ al sin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is the evil intent that stands behind it is only too obvious .
for the report that has just been published was reli@@ eved of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the time of thought would have acquired a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who had gained great mer@@ its and perhaps outside of Bavaria , probably none of Germany would have known to let the rain@@ water spar@@ row . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
