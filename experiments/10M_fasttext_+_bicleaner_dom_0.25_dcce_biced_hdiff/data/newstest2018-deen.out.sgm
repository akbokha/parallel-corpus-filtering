<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">A Irren-Anstalt where young people should meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A mines chapel that is now excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners cultivate the former reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map in Munich fosters exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It annoys when maps are not currently available.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "" "" "it knows everyone who had to be exciting, because the car-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a walking street." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "the historical maps of the digital Bayern Atlases, an offer of the geoport Bavaria of the state government, are anything but currently very illuminating." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "then it is clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the distribution area of the Munich Mercury, since the 19th century." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern Atlas is a patchwork that can not be recognized as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "into the big picture postcard set for cities and municipalities more detailed maps, so-called urine leaves." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">These were written according to the Bavarian Authority management between 1810 and 1864 and resulted in the first dimension of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted a survey of the occupied land and had a topographic recording in Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "lastly, when the French troops attacked the peace of Lunéville from 9 February 1801: today's neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern map." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Elector Max IV Joseph drives the project ahead and founded the "topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bayerische surveying management.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Author for Munich came from 1856 and can be found as any other one of the Bavarian State Library's website.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison early / Today is the most impressive example of the capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example of this is sub-ordination that is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "Sendling was constructed 21 years after the map creation, so 1877, in the Munich area." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Today Giraffling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings are situated in 1856 along the today's Plinganserstraße which was first named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the West Park is seen here you can see nothing but fields - at first sight: there is a small-piece card with dozens lines and numbers: handwritten number of pieces taken from the so-called "urine smell" from which the land tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">Small parcels exist today no more - but small gardeners of land "land in sun."</seg>

<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and went to a youth home with vocational training.</seg>

<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was named in 1856 as "Main Place" and the department name called "Kaufinger Gasse."</seg>

<seg id="99">"" "" "" "the safest sign of a regime change is, when they begin to attack the statues." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="112">Lazarus and her friends who are preparing to place their words after her death - knew very well that they accomplished a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">"" "" "" "the sculpture should show the interconnections between French and American republicism, represented in a worn-out classical visual imaging the female embodiment of liberty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus had this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives himself a very different name: mother of exiles.</seg>

<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not shine the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of statue is whole and even a matter of standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "the vast majority of Lazarus was in this to see how they had seen from the exhausting, but hopeful people after lengthy and often terrible trips on the decks." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "" "" "it is in the true sense of seeing the world from a perspective of people, seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="125">"" "" "" "their statue says to them the words of hope and welcome, which they must hear." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2937">How do the jab pads of Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he could have had his right knowledge (Georg Ratzinger) and could have been able to stop the respective doers.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"" "" ""... "I think it... also for really absurd, accept that it impacted... Buben intrusive or more clear or rather reopened as compared to their parents, internatsaries, trust teachers, etc." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2945">The media had a lot of "Violence" at the Palace of the Palace.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former dometer champion Georg Ratzinger will be thrown into the report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and confused with a huge melange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is once again a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"" "" "" "so it is clean separately: between the preschool and the gymnasium of the cathedral, between sexual abuse and violence, we say once, other accusations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2951">"" "" "" "moreover, the report deals with the time incidents from the period since 1945, so Georg Ratzinger was not the leader of the cathedral sparrow." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2952">"" "" "" "the entire awful test pedagogy, the cases, in which boys of sadistic teachers have been lying and painted, all happened at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous states have to be ruled." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2953">"" "" "" "but with them, George Ratzinger had nothing to do with those, because he did not get the boys to the face when they were already on the premises in the domain." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "" "" "on what was, like most of the witnesses, the topic of" preschool "tabu." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2956">What was different on the premises of the domain?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was indeed some discipline but no sadious violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "" "" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that" many victims "assessments the general humanity of R. assessed, and therefore even positive memories with him in numerous cases." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">So nobody remains at the best to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"" "" "" "but despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the conditions on the preschool." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">"" "" "" "the first time 1970 / 71, when he began to establish and was in charge of the events at a school, where he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) would not hear anything, and then again about 1993." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently concede the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"" "" "" "Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dominion School." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2964">In this he shows this way that in the preschool continues to be practiced in the test. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">In view of the danger of negative press lines he recommended urgent action.</seg>

<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we are talking historians here from the "Fallout of Alaronism," thus the danger to evaluate today's moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is right there.</seg>
