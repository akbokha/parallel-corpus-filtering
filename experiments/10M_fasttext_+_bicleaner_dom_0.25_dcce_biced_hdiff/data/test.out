28 @-@ year @-@ old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 28 @-@ year @-@ old cook , recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in a local shopping centre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brother of the victim said that he could not imagine any man who would harm him , &quot; Fin@@ ally , it went up in him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cor@@ p@@ se , which was found on Wednesday morning , was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gal@@ icia from San Francisco , distributed medical department in San Francisco . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the San Francisco Police Department said that the death was classified as a murder , and the investigations on running . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brother of the sacrifice , Louis Gal@@ icia , divided the ABS transmitter K@@ GO in San Francisco , that Frank announced earlier than a cook in San Francisco for six months ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ man for the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ gh@@ ters said that she was shocked and destroyed at the ground . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a little team , which works like a close family and we will miss him in pain , &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and our con@@ dol@@ ences are in this severe period of Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gal@@ icia announced that Frank was first in the hostel at first , but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found one apartment , he had a friend , &quot; shared Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gal@@ icia said that he would not imagine any man , would harm his younger brother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was a friendly man with a great heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a way to combine his kind with his family to prepare ourselves a little while we prepare dinner , &quot; said Louis Gal@@ icia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he never wanted to take part in any kind of confron@@ tation .
he was the brother who sponge the river .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed diamond that bla@@ sted every day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who has the case , is asked to call the Hin@@ du@@ ck@@ ef@@ on of the SF@@ PD under number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jennifer Ani@@ ston : I will always be in the drawers
Jennifer Ani@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
this now clearly understood the Hollywood star in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will always be put in drawers , or get out of the outside label living with me and the reality often little to do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I myself did not wish to be perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , these things are quite snow@@ tu@@ lip . &quot;
Jennifer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh that she is regarded as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; in the current &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the act@@ ress will love her time at home , pre@@ set television with loose and mexican food , means it is in the magazine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for white blood they bring the question of the children &apos;s desire : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women must not be married or have children to be completely , &quot; so the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play &quot; is an Ani@@ ston as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs from us on 25th August .
Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports Py@@ ramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of a golf tur@@ ni@@ ers in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger sought a little variety with some colleagues and a ride on the beach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
Chi@@ o : &quot; golden sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a few minutes the horses remin@@ ded on their fes@@ tivities , they hun@@ ted in the fast gal@@ op home to the feeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one kilometer during this temp@@ o I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and with that the riders ended up again .
on Saturday the best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament awards - again near horses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has guided himself with his family about the system of AL@@ RV on a horse , he would not even have a photo shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first time in Aachen was the first time in Aachen .
the reason was absolutely convincing .
the German sports aid was handed over to the man from An@@ hausen in the framework of a small gala into the Golden Py@@ ramid .
awards lack the sympath@@ etic ath@@ lete .
cross trainer , silver leaf leaf , Champions Tour player of the year ...
even the British Queen has enth@@ r@@ alled him .
the 18th winner of the sports py@@ rami@@ de is the 18th winner .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner of Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; this award means a lot to me &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; for she is not only awarded for spor@@ tive successes but also for soci@@ etal commitment . &quot;
Lan@@ ger supports the young generation for decades .
and so he gave the prize money of 25.000 Euro even further .
the two @-@ time US master winner was added to the Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports with 15 other outstanding athletes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the drawn sections , the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , who Turner Eber@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , who &apos;s Ru@@ le Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , who &apos;s wife Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um the Hand@@ b@@ aller Erhard was wonderful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of these sports events came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the official part , the company passes to the Spring@@ st@@ adion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held a distance towards the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ ump economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
to invest in infrastructure and prevent the T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
but the two US @-@ Presi@@ dential candidates are subject to tax and energy policy as well as in a policy issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the differences in the economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton is a basic , rather philosoph@@ ical difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; l@@ ump wants to keep the doubt rather small , and war@@ ns how the state of economy may harm the economy - with taxes and regul@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wants to raise the economy to death and regul@@ ate death . he says .
he himself would be quite different - asser@@ ted Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will bring back heavy traffic , and it is strong - for far @-@ reaching tax reform - for private professionals and companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton says : the state has certain tasks to open to open a dis@@ advantage and needs money .
that is why taxes are increased for the rich .
interest@@ ingly both are very close to infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the year , Tr@@ ump and Clinton predi@@ ct almost immediately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the democratic application in announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policy and are stri@@ pped directly by the state @-@ critical Te@@ ut@@ y wing of the Republi@@ can .
on Tr@@ ump you might need some party discussions yet .
the differences in the energy and climate policy are clear .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal power plants and bring coal to coal to the USA .
oil extraction is expected to be possible in previously protected areas that wants to announce a climate protection agreement to Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , Clinton intends to expand the renewable energies with their investment program and demands : &quot; a country will create clean energies and generate millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China or Germany or America - I want that we are . &quot;
but not only when the infrastructure - international trade agreements are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ i@@ fic trade agreement and do not want to sign both .
but they both do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but just making American jobs better .
they should be paid better then by Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7,@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger wage .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what tr@@ ump does not want to do this question is not quite clear : once , he says : the minimum wage has to be broken , he says he must not be changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the large discussion of the coming months should probably be rather likely to develop the tax policy of both camps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , which wants to un@@ load the economy and citizens to cur@@ ate growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his critics hold him to him in order that the bud@@ get@@ ary deficit would only get bigger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who wants to ask at least from the rich people want to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
escape : &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence is one of women who escape alone , almost in everyday life .
if they arrive in Germany they are often trau@@ ma@@ tised .
a house provides sanctuary .
in a big kitchen there are four women .
each has a baby at the most one year old .
one has laid their little son in his arms .
he looks curious in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the table @-@ top .
until she noticed that she is observed .
they sm@@ iles short and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene works normal .
you will talk to Katrin B@@ ahr .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is an area president of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a vehicle for social assistance in Bavaria , and deals among others with the subject of women on the run . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in the Munich in one of the few dec@@ entr@@ alised accommodations for families and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs made the furniture together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Frau@@ erh@@ ilfe .
it has been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - not as visitors .
the exception is a guard from the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated to say : every woman who counts here , has made experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars , because they are politically persec@@ uted because of them torture or death , or because their families send them as a hope for Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in women some other reasons for the run : &quot; many steal secretly of them , because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their home , they have experience with sexual violence , forced , moral , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is driving them away .
continue this on the run .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the tugs require for a bottle of water a sexual action is not a rar@@ ity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone ; they are not protected by their families .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who believe that the end soon as they arrived in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even here single women would often be considered inferior and worst in refugee camps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this leads to the fact that around 90 percent of women living in the middle of the neighborhood are trau@@ mati@@ zed , appreci@@ ates them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntarily . &quot;
many women let it say that they say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the creation , because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since they often don &apos;t aid , more accommodations are required for them , demands B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the seven regional establ@@ ishments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the question whether they v@@ aul@@ ted from a similar project , as in Munich in its scope of jurisdiction , answers some with no . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken there is nothing in general conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in Schw@@ aben , only pregnant women are not housed , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press Officer of the government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Bavaria , unter@@ - and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia , there are only two floors or private houses for single women and their children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the exception to Lower Bavaria is there two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also the committee &quot; Rights of Women and Gender Equality , &quot; in the European Parliament , demands that women must be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study being published for the Committee , it is important : &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the privacy or the men and women are accommod@@ ated together , it may lead to - ongoing violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; above all , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , stands in the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as very women feel the need of this protection , people can read off the crow@@ ds whom it gives to the house in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; since we talked about that there is a long waiting list &quot; says B@@ ahr .
you could easily make a second house .
general practition@@ ers : demands on new labour measures
Deputy Chairman of the As@@ sist@@ ants have called for their union to appro@@ ve new labour measures with their disputes regarding a new contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) called for the entire Council , appro@@ ve more working measures from the beginning of September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the J@@ DC said that it would have accused the ministers concerning the concerns about the contract .
general practition@@ ers and medical students voted in July on the re@@ jection of a contract that was agreed with BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who have voted in the elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the members , which on Thursday evening was published on Twitter , the government of J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government would have remained calm and problems that the contract was rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC board voted to fully reject the proposed new treaty and demands official new negotiations with all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC committee today challenged a formal application for a special meeting of BM@@ A Council to start a running program of working measures that begin in early September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disputes in this year led to a general practition@@ ers , the first total fail@@ ures in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the director of the BM@@ A assist@@ ants Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came back after the election of the agreed contract @-@ conditions that had been recommended by the BM@@ A .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings conducted before the vote by 5@@ 4.000 doctors and medical students , with that the contract should be adv@@ anta@@ geous and accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health said Jerem@@ y H@@ unt , that the Treaty for Doc@@ tors in England would be introduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of out@@ sides &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday , to give themselves the hands and an official end of eight months lasting war of words and economic sanctions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish opposite side in the g@@ ild@@ ed Hall of the St. Petersburg palace , I cannot forbi@@ d that Ankara wants to be the pro@@ pi@@ ti@@ ation most . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the hand@@ shake . yes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Putin sm@@ iles worked , and he radi@@ ated little warmth , even for its re@@ strained circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Recep Tayyip Erd@@ ogan repeatedly spoke of his &quot; dear Friend &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any longer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also said that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but can even improve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next day , a newspaper described that Erd@@ ogan would have beha@@ ved like no worst happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to me his enthusiasm was rather the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s be@@ v@@ ant mind showed that state of state of state of Russia had not forgotten .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first to mention in its initi@@ ation , the shooting of a Russian campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was sore .
Putin made it clear and accused Ankara on his back .
the delay was even bigger because it was committed by a familiar friend .
Vet@@ rop@@ ack is re@@ building it becomes difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for months , the state controlled media carried out a heavy , unlimited attack on Ankara . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
suddenly it appeared as if the Turks would carry everything the blame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most serious officials , the accus@@ ations of government officials , that from illegal oil traff@@ icking in areas of Syria could have benefited from the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has cont@@ ested this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St. Petersburg the official message kept that it is time to look forward .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , this meeting only took place because Putin received the ap@@ ology from the President Erd@@ ogan who he wanted to hear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russia could book a kind of victory .
the advantages of a tru@@ ce resistance are obvious in Ankara .
Erd@@ ogan is primarily based on all friends who can get he received after the last month at a failed coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at almost his office .
terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken it .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard , particularly the prohibition of charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the number is decreased by nearly 90 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be facilit@@ ated if the flights are res@@ umed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are among the late seasonal che@@ er of the Mediterranean .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this week , the sovereign debt claims fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are once again allowed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a report on Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i formulated it as follows : &quot; tourists stay there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry with the West as it was the response to trying to sei@@ ze power for power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , the continuing res@@ ll of EU accession negotiations and Putin &apos;s accession negotiations will come from the cool mood and reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ankara , the Russian Chief of Defence won a bonus for that he called for the attemp@@ ted coup to support the elected state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is well known for Moscow who has given itself a deep sense of regim@@ ent to himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the summit meeting in this great palace on the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey , a analy@@ st once described me an analy@@ st , &quot; Alliance of external lateral not@@ ices : two countries are treated and badly treated from the West . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless the public at@@ on@@ ement still exist between the two and always major differences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently announced the role as a peace @-@ based role , but where Russia and Turkey support each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could be characteristic that after almost three hours of first talks on the press conference , they said that they had not even mat@@ ured the subject . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the president of Turkey has deliber@@ ately avoided a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ise this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no unique con@@ sensus on it , where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and given its potential for a total dis@@ gu@@ age , as NATO member Turkey dropped the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two states of state talk at least again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
the R@@ BS edition is supposed to have only been reduced to a back@@ office reel according to the Chairman of the Bank .
Royal Bank of Scotland will not be available for clients outside of Scotland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan distributed the BBC Scotland , that the R@@ BS label was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , the bank has dis@@ soci@@ ated and had to be almost collap@@ sing and res@@ cu@@ ed almost eight years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during this time , brand @-@ winning &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other final consum@@ ables . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds at sponsor@@ ship from the Six Nations Rug@@ by up to the Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to bring more national brands in the focus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will be only available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the main office and its stock exchange to Nat@@ West are changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for clients in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are other , smaller brands for private clients that will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a guided tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B will be employed to our investment brand and to the brand , which will be employed by our employees , as we now become more of a bank of marks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Bank became a global brand , R@@ BS was a global brand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now I say that we are not pursuing global goals but to track local goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different , and our staff will work among these brands with customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS has already said that it will not continue his Six Nations Sponsor@@ ship , and that it will increase the per@@ cep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in his sport @-@ sponsor@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop to the bank of brands , because how are we concentrate on making it to a better Bank for customers ? &quot; said the board of directors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ical three years ago , when we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and had launched these brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori at@@ tained its 3@@ .000@@ .000 profit in the market at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
D@@ ett@@ ori contra@@ sts champagne after a double with New@@ market that brings its 3@@ .000@@ th win to him
Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3@@ .000@@ th British profit in New@@ market on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he sat on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , which is trained by John G@@ os@@ den , a milestone in his local race course with his second win of the night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth Jo@@ ckey which reaches the milestone in the flat race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , Pat Ed@@ dry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the three @-@ channel winner D@@ ett@@ ori that previously won on G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar said : &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m very happy with New@@ market , because I have landed here for 30 years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the ju@@ bel as he takes the victory on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two jo@@ ck@@ e@@ ys reached the milestone in obst@@ acle running - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the pen@@ sion@@ ed 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t who had the ninth D@@ erb@@ ysi@@ eger from 4.@@ 4@@ 93 .
Frank@@ ie is one of the best Jo@@ ckey of the modern and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone only a few before it reached .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ le@@ ct that distingu@@ ishes him from the others in the weight control room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma , and has been enthusiastic fans for this sport for years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already fet@@ ched 6,000 wins , if he had not just a weekend and Grand tur@@ ni@@ er@@ jo@@ ckey ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Frank@@ ie has shown nearly 30 years winner in the UK what is great .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a lively personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition , it is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flying back to Flying Fin@@ flies , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the sign of the British flat ridge for two decades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was nerve @-@ wra@@ cking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a whole series of great tur@@ ni@@ sts win , including its famous &quot; glorious Seven &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived an airplane and offered a drug ban . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three years ago , he initially had difficulty when he returned from his six month lock , but he showed an impressive typical strength to def@@ y his branches and to his best . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it is still a long time not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori told it earlier , that he wants to continue playing at least 50@@ .@@ ten years of life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russia &apos;s Putin @-@ fired Chief of Staff Serge@@ ov Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin hasn &apos;t been dis@@ missed by his Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was a part of the closest family of trust in Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed specially for environmental and transport issues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is that Putin had ordered the dis@@ mis@@ sal of Ivan@@ ov@@ s who ordered his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential management . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who had been responsible for the 2012 Ivan@@ ov@@ s who was promoted to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 is a former diplom@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; born in 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital of Tallinn , he graduated from the Moscow State Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it is known ( in Russian ) that he later was the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer .
about his appointment he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as a state of state , regarding law charges and insp@@ ections on implementation of your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV channel to Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked for his post to leave his post and advised V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow am@@ bush .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was a long time of the closest con@@ spir@@ ators of Vladimir Putin and works as he was for the Soviet Intelligence service in the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on TV , both men claim that Chief of Staff will hold upon his own request . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but despite the ridi@@ cu@@ le for the cameras , here are only a few of it - especially now , shortly before the parliamentary elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
no one knows that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the official statement - that a man who once declared to be a potential president , wants to lead to Russian environmental policy - across major scep@@ tic@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his remarks on Putin that are quoted on the website of Kre@@ m@@ lin , &quot; Ivan@@ ov . &quot; it &apos;s true that I beg@@ ged you to put this very complicated post - one could almost say - descri@@ p@@ tive post four years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential management for four years and eight months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V took the post in December 2011 .
before that he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin &apos;s former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was Chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , the K@@ GB was promoted to his deputy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Putin entered the power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people in whom he trusted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once has been accepted that Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term , as a third term of office attemp@@ ted against the constitution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this post was taken by another ally seized ally of Putin , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin was prime minister , before he became President three and a half years later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gibson was fired after he &apos;s producer
Gibson was last month involved in a physical confron@@ tation on the set of the series in Los Angeles .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios that produce the series are made in a common position on his termination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gibson , who played the special agent Aaron Hot@@ ch@@ ner , ap@@ olog@@ ises publicly on Thursday prior to disclosure of his termination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the set there came to artistic differences and a difference of opinion .
I regret the incident . &quot; he said in a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; details on how the character Gib@@ sons from the series , which is followed by a team of FB@@ I agents , will be published according to the ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios at a later date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Greg , has been with us since the first season of the 2005 series . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I love British Min@@ ds and put my whole heart har@@ ness in the last twelve years . &quot; said Gibson in a message published on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had hop@@ ed to be there by the end , but it will not be possible now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans that you can only wish for a series . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned transmission of the twel@@ fth season has been scheduled on 28 September .
mystery about fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a resident of Ban@@ ff demanded for the identification of fishes aid to , who di@@ ved in his garden in Ban@@ ff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kevin B@@ ain thinks that there could take the 75 fish to be San@@ da@@ ale , who were separated from a fountain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , Per@@ is@@ cope published a video of the spectacle in hope that someone could throw somewhat light on the appearance of the two inch long fish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Que@@ ens@@ heading Crossing : bridge now linked to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; engineers have linked the north deck of Que@@ ens@@ land Cros@@ dres@@ sings to vi@@ adu@@ ct , meaning that the bridge is now connected to fi@@ fe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closing arguments , covering the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30.000 tonnes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete , and 46 Siz@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Minister of Economic Affairs Keith Brown , the site visited a visit today and was one of the first who went from country to the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said : &quot; this is a historic and symbolic moment when construction of Que@@ ens@@ land Cros@@ sings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are all witnesses of a engineering of a truly epic measure with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the displac@@ ement between the vi@@ adu@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; overall , almost 79 % of the total bridge decks are at their place and the last section of the decks , this means that the whole deck is ready to be raised on the bridge to its place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tor said : &quot; the first clas@@ p presents a considerable milestone in each bridge project .
this fantastic project represents the closure of forward @-@ looking high and depth construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following the installation of the last street cover and its connection with the North tur@@ f deck , we had to close even existing gap on the north or land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was reached by pulling the northern feeder of 700 milli@@ metres to the south .
this was a massive and very delicate job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; massive , since the vi@@ adu@@ ct is 222 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards with an ascent of about 3 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sanc@@ tified , since the toler@@ ances that the team works , tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
luck@@ ily everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men are lucky to be still alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three men were lucky to be still alive , after they were thrown off their fishing boat at Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station suggested Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T Alarm , after a crew observed the event at Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men had difficulty to swim in safety , while their boat moved from their own power . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat revol@@ ved around around and set us the worst before , &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck@@ ily the strong winds have already blows the boat out of their reach until we let come into water , &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man at the age of 60 was exhausted and found on a Bo@@ je hanging without life@@ jacket . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they all came aboard the coastal strip and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Jones said , &quot; The three men that were thrown into the water , were lucky , and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the boat had an emergency stop , this dis@@ b@@ anded the boat cap@@ tion from the person who had a boat to control the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
someone has grown up today about these men .
severely injured - man sm@@ ells to his ex @-@ friend
a man attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the police yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the keys to get to the apartment to get his personal things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead the non @-@ alcoholic offen@@ ders cut the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this came to the apartment , he stran@@ gled out twice on her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was hurt at the hand and in the body .
the police could establish the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old , the clothes of his ex @-@ friend was destroyed , he called his mother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these al@@ ar@@ rests upon their sister .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother together with her partner .
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her partner .
on the road they met ex @-@ habit@@ ants of the man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the two women hit the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old gave his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ friend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who builds Braun@@ schwei@@ gs affordable housing ?
the SPD and gene@@ tically modified : investors should be taken much more strongly in the future .
how do you react to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose nearly 1300 in the next few years ?
the SPD suggests the next Council meeting with Living Museums . &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
first of all about the question : who should actually build the favorable apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SPD @-@ president Christoph Brat@@ mann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are alone with the Gre@@ ens : if you want to build urban areas in the future , 20 percent of all dwell@@ ings have to do as soci@@ alizing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the affordable apartments can also be found in the continu@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the big dispute point in the town hall is however , as viol@@ mann : &quot; how do you want to build investors that want to build private areas ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors in such areas at least 10 percent , but as far as 20 percent of dwell@@ ings are building as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing programme that will cost millions of people and will have to finance it is planned to provide incen@@ tives .
the problem , so viol@@ mann : &quot; there is still no agreement between the fra@@ ctions . &quot;
the CDU would like to make investors as few regulations as possible .
the left wants to har@@ sh@@ ly har@@ sh@@ ness contracts for investors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regardless of what is , viol@@ i , whi@@ pped a waste of the situation in the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action concept will be implemented that will ensure additional tasks in the construction management .
more staff is required .
it is un@@ clear if we get the professionals .
yet the program is not entirely obvious : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments should be built anyway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but how do you compare the loss of further around 1,@@ 300 low @-@ priced apartments , whose funding will be expi@@ red in the next few years ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be 500 apartments alone by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to prevent this , the planning policy makers Nicole Palm , should now be bought from the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , it would have to be re@@ designed to bring apartments back to the price list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is possible in the western town .
on a blow I can solve the problem .
for the end of the year in the West city Fri@@ sts run out .
around 1800 flats one could get there back to the price @-@ binding for affordable housing .
only : they do not want the owners , the housing companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the number of social expenses in the western city increases dra@@ stically , one removed from the aim of so @-@ called interference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there should be no more concentration of social weak in a few parts of the city .
the Gre@@ ens estimate that there will be movement in the discussion .
S &amp; D Group President Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke said : &quot; for a broad majority the CDU must be with the boat . &quot;
I have focused on more designs for family homes .
but something does not mean that there is no compromise yet .
Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go , a ch@@ ase for health and luck which pays off
it is fascinating to see how the world is changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that teen@@ ager and child go to play no more outside , but rather prefer to spend their free time on screens on screens in the last decade of many . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at Po@@ k@@ emon Go there &apos;s about to get people from the sofa and be more active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the time on the screen was originally restricted to the TV , then on video games and la@@ stly on smartphones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and activities are not exclu@@ de each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am referring to the Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that were created on the characters which were created first for the video games in the 1990s ( later an animation series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like many phenomena of pop culture sun@@ k the interest in the publishing of the game in the US , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the market launch in other countries has been moved by massive demand that over@@ loaded the server .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within a few days , Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go more users as Tin@@ tin and almost as many as Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in short , players go to outside and search for Po@@ k@@ é@@ mons that are followed with a GPS and once they were found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( above a screenshot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a generation that played the game , when she was younger , joined the train and j@@ ump@@ ed for the search of the sofa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the USA , the game led to a considerable increase in steps which the average &quot; person returns every day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; car@@ dio , an app for Apple Watch , followed the 35@@ ,000 users , shared the number of people followed by the game within two days of launch by 45 percent to 53 percent each day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company does not know who plays Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go - it &apos;s only the raw data to boost performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are many public awareness campaigns for people who want to bring people to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; walk from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; being active on de@@ af ears , because many public messages are boring for health and people come alive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless the importance of sports can not be over@@ rated .
who regularly drives sports and reduces his chances of ill cancer or depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes , and a long list of advantages who are too long to use it here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the wonderful thing to Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go is that people bring people to do something in the open , that is fun to them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
three pillars of health are covered - moving , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even close new friends on the hunt .
as always there are m@@ ür@@ ical toys that must always be compl@@ ain about something .
and yes . someone could run against a door .
what is it supposed to do ?
it has a breakthrough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if smartphone Apps would have been able to follow our activity earlier , they didn &apos;t give us any reason to exercise sports like this game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new will lose its charm , and the use is complete with time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to Po@@ k@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , there will be more games , combining apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and will be helping people on the hunt , more active , f@@ itter and health@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ages
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all that immune .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breath taking on the ground .
brilliant on all the line .
and now the Olympic Gold is now also available .
19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ ast left the gap between themselves and the rest of the world on Thursday and the rest of the world before the spot@@ light of the Olympic Games .
their overall score of 6@@ 2.@@ 198 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; -@@ Mann@@ er@@ sk@@ amer@@ ad@@ in A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the American women of Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the Swe@@ de during the individual majority of women at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil and Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman who wins a multi @-@ fight and overall the fifth , while they strengthen their reputation , the best of their generation or even at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she broke her tears when her final result was shown and her long journey took place in this moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this success makes them in the same league as unique athletes such as Michael P@@ helps , who brought her sports to new heights : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bil@@ es dominated their sport , 15 world gold medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises , that she is the best gym@@ n@@ ast who I ever saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was expected to test a last test in Brazil , a competition that was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather over a burden of over@@ sized expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not with a hand@@ ful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered dis@@ appointment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the American women of Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace it during the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , during the 2014 Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bil@@ es collected the first medal on Tuesday , while she served in the part@@ ing party of retirement in retirement , Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i served as a call@@ sign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted , during their long course on the top , never the future planned , this is not really true . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; part of their ground exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling passport - is matched to Latin American music , which would fit home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not a co@@ incidence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child , adopted by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school retreat in the gym , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the summer of 2013 , she has no longer lost a competition competition , a winning series that will stop as long as it wants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even if Must@@ af@@ ina led slightly by two revol@@ ves which led the image .
Schwe@@ be@@ k and Bo@@ dent@@ als - in which Bil@@ es holds the World Championships .
she repeated later again with 15.@@ 4@@ 33 on the sli@@ p@@ om again - and replaced with an 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently as her en@@ der@@ ment - a pure form@@ ality - and tears flow@@ ed in Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner as the vision who once was described in their collection log .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ra@@ is@@ man &apos;s performance was a reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke had went to Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old man @-@ capit@@ ulation , called &quot; O@@ ma &quot; , was named by the Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after their ground exercise , she cast the audience to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes came du@@ bi@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for Bil@@ es , the soon @-@ year @-@ old of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old took a completely new meaning : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
police : 3 victims in serial k@@ illers while listening to music in the car
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the police reports that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were shot that killed in one of the most fatal attacks since a decade in the first series of mur@@ der@@ ers and music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Rochelle liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah was shot on 12 June while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ v@@ eway , the authorities said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offen@@ ders fired eight shots from a hand gun , while he stood on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle to read in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police shared that the thre@@ e@@ fold murder has not been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ nation , since the att@@ ack@@ ers took not the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who took possession of the adult victims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jonathan S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting was led by investig@@ ators , making a closer look at it , whether they are connected with four previous attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , seven people were killed and two others were killed in H@@ is@@ panic living rooms within four months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it takes place in a residential area against a house , the Howard der K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , in the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is assumed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investig@@ ators refused to dis@@ close the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked with the same mur@@ derer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
El@@ lis , 33 and was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a witness to the police , that it wasn &apos;t unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which turned half an hour before the thre@@ e@@ fold murder and assumed that it was the production of the serial k@@ iller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
investig@@ ators found Pat@@ ron@@ g@@ ül@@ sen and secured a bul@@ let from the seat as well as pen fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 year old with micro@@ scop@@ es : &quot; it gets better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but like the least of his aging , Edmund H@@ eps , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to did not know anything during their pregnancy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I don &apos;t make it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t create it .
that &apos;s why I did not leave .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s wrong at all -- of course , you have left on it , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her husband Vincent , and her was told that Edmund will never know them under circumstances , and that he may not even survive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they beat him to institutional investors .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still make &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Edmund can walk with the help of help .
Edmund was not able to sit or craw@@ l up to his third year of age nor he can &apos;t speak .
but it slowly makes progress .
he can run with support and cycle .
he loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund is for &quot; Please sing something to me . &quot;
&quot; we teach him a sign language at &quot; conducted by Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but there is no typical sign language -- says it . Edmund has invented some notes alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia has a number of causes : genetic such as Edmund , and infections with viruses like mas@@ ks or the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus during pregnancy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the symptoms and progn@@ oses may vary greatly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s still too early to say , how the lives of the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus is influenced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to is remin@@ is@@ cent of the emotional price of a uncertain future .
I wonder@@ ed what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and it still doesn &apos;t really know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a long time , I have no longer asked for the forecast , because I didn &apos;t expect that someone can really say to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has created a hop@@ eful advice for mothers with inf@@ ant injuries which were caused by the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
it is getting better .
they know that it will become better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy rainf@@ alls , F@@ loo@@ t gives reasons to escape in Louisiana , Mississi@@ ppi
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heavy rainf@@ alls and large floo@@ ding in Louisiana forced the governor to call the emergency , on Friday it will be charged with more rainf@@ alls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; numerous rivers in south @-@ east Lou@@ isi@@ anas and the south of the Mississi@@ pp@@ is floo@@ ded their banks , causing severe floo@@ ding to extreme rainf@@ alls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the governor of Louisiana John B@@ el Edwards , who had state officials in permanent contact with local authorities and have assistance to the communities already underway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a speaker for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness of Govern@@ ors , divided the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ste@@ ele said that alone the village of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had requested ten thousand sand bags .
a flood warning system is used across large parts in the south Lou@@ isi@@ ana until Saturday .
the weather was sil@@ ently that in this area could fall additional 3 to 5 inches on rain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , a Fl@@ ut@@ breakfast system was deployed in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama as it was still ra@@ ining in the mobile sector . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Com@@ ite river near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite close to Den@@ ham Springs , which both are located in Louisiana , all lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood are reaching a record level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers might be floo@@ ded in the near bat@@ on Rouge near Bat@@ on Rouge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also said that a downstream floo@@ ding in Ascension is a danger , as these are just slowly flowing into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the river Ca@@ fa@@ w , south of the Mississi@@ ppi State border in Liverpool , Louisiana , reached the highest stand on Friday already at 09.@@ 00 , which was recorded ever . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rescue teams still ple@@ ad people from the flood in the Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kinson districts in Mississi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y H@@ ans@@ ford about his wife and his step@@ son were found under the ones that were res@@ cu@@ ed near Glo@@ ves on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ans@@ ford , 62 , says that there is water of Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house to rise overnight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that another step@@ son , who lives near , would have warned him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we woke up and the water flow@@ ed and wo@@ oned in . &quot; said H@@ ans@@ ford .
it reached my wa@@ ist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his wife said H@@ ans@@ ford that she was in the early 48 years , where she lived there , never seen such a high level of the river . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ans@@ ford said that he and his family members had all the disabled and he would be the only one to swim .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ans@@ ford said that emergency aid could have saved all three in a big military truck , and had brought it to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated up until Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the flood was quickly spreading , as it continued heavy rain falls and that the authorities take evacuation instructions into account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an ob@@ server recorded live from Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday tomorrow of 13,@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the soil had been substantially completed through rainfall since Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities hal@@ ted that heavy rainf@@ alls and roads floo@@ ding the rescue of inhabitants from their houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish , and lesson in five school districts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the C@@ BS subsidiary EM@@ L reported that an ordered blanket was ang@@ ulated in tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa at 200 floo@@ ded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches - both of them were floo@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pioneer of the assembly of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities were saved 72 people and seven pets , which were washed from floods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond the accommodations were arranged to accommodate the ev@@ acu@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the water begins to go , they will return to their houses again , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the city of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , nearly two dozens of roads were closed due to high water and are hoping for residents to keep the water from their homes and shops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last great flood , which we had , was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum of the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to become a similar incident .
in Mississi@@ pp the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison county put lies that it continues to ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to his data , a hand@@ ful of houses had been reported as floo@@ ded on Thursday , but on Friday they were not reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Keith Town@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw water at places where I never seen it , &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; and it still comes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; bul@@ lets out of bul@@ lets &quot; survived the shooting in Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police shares with that the 6 year old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boys identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grand@@ parents noticed that Brown has suffered several shot injuries including in the lung , leg , arm and belly , but that he was during his transport to the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done much , his small body was pier@@ ced by bul@@ lets , &quot; his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ting to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it simply .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the condition of the boy was judged as cri@@ tically in a hospital , and he had to undergo various operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the family of the boys divided the sender with that it is expected to be re @-@ used again .
he should have put the first class in a local primary school .
Brown has been one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three men were also shot at the age of 29 , and a 32 @-@ year old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the 29 @-@ year old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable condition at C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boy was shot up on the front seat of a car along with the 29 @-@ year old , which is located in a critical state , recorded on the sender . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the other two victims did not find themselves in the car , and police are determined , whether under one of the injured men of the perpet@@ rators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
investig@@ ators composed C@@ BS Philadelphia with that it seems that it seems that it had come to a cr@@ fire between several archers .
pat@@ ron@@ pul@@ ses for assault rif@@ les which were tra@@ ced to various assault rif@@ les , passed the crime scene .
it seems that it was clearly tra@@ ded to fight against a constant fight .
on the road on both sides of the road we found H@@ ül@@ sen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it seems to have given several armed fighters who were very actively involved , &quot; par@@ ted police p@@ mann Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no arrest , and the police reported records according to the surveillance video . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another 6 year @-@ old girl hit his arm on Tuesday , when she played before her house in the area of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they re@@ covers and police search for susp@@ ects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I propose to me under the women &apos;s Olympics in Tur@@ ning and this is more than one reason .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , since 1984 , I have been with each summer Olympics since 1984 and the US had never been so dominant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and second : this team has three ner@@ ves , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren , Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin colour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the structure of this squ@@ ad , which is A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jewish is and Madison Ko@@ cian , the Cath@@ o@@ cian , makes everyone proud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this team finally reflects the US .
it paved the black and h@@ is@@ panic female presence at the foref@@ ront of this sport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past four years , the number one was one African @-@ American woman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were
this shows strength .
during the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic win and winner in America .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world championships in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they were unexpected , but master@@ ing gy@@ mas@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman who won gold with an individual majority event for women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
male member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we are experiencing the tip of this sport though so they don &apos;t look at gym in the whole country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie hit all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison to get it to the Olympic team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four heads in the team . besides , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but reality looks like a more expensive sport and Turner will be united in first line in private turn@@ outs , which will be applied to training , travel , travel , travel and hotel costs ( for the trainer and their Turner and Famili@@ es ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of these turn@@ outs remain in weal@@ thy suburbs , which can support business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these clubs , the Turner will acquire your overall training and that is for families a dev@@ out and long lasting commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , Train@@ ee of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , Train@@ ee of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both of their athletes , since then they started with the tower . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to insp@@ ite the churches of countless , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , provide a more powerful and easily accessible turn training course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I founded my train@@ ee in 20 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during my events , we have instructed free and affordable Tur@@ ns in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban teenagers ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) , and national and international winners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my hometown ) to enhance the youth of high quality tur@@ nes , which earn the possibility to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tur@@ ns develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for the school@@ ing and professional success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the inspiration of this crew , which bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the tur@@ nes and that &apos;s great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is so important to participate in the sport . especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the Olympic team club and thank you to get their way to start healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Regist@@ ra@@ r would like to organize further strikes after they refused to accept Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts suggestion
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute concerning the amendments by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ .000 assist@@ ants who voted in a vote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in July , H@@ unt plans had revealed the treaty and said that the N@@ HS would be harmful in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and would be harmful to any further delay for the staff and patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first assist@@ ants are supposed to receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend work in order to improve maintenance costs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chair@@ person of the BM@@ A Commission for assist@@ ants last night in a communication with : &quot; Regist@@ ra@@ cians &quot; to heat the current fiscal crisis and it will be agreed to treat all physi@@ cians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for just eight weeks , the remaining group of doctors remain under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; efforts by the BM@@ A solution to solving the disputes by convers@@ ations by the government on Resistance , and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the case of speaking , the Jerem@@ y H@@ unt just about it last month that his door would always open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Jerem@@ y H@@ unt now has to act now to raise the en@@ forcement and confirm the wor@@ ries of assist@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he does not do this , the practition@@ ers have clearly made it ready to conduct other working measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last strike end of April saw a boost of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100.000 schedules , since nur@@ ses and experts have been involved to allow doctors on the strike chain cover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute concerning the changes of the re@@ formed agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the BM@@ A wants to pay a better week@@ day for the 5@@ 4.000 doctors that are subject to the contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of N@@ HS employees , demanded the practition@@ ers to end the strike . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; working measures achieve nothing but little , but already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , nursing staff and their families only wor@@ ries , emergency and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the last two months , we talked to the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries responded positively to the concerns regarding the pre@@ m@@ acy and W@@ hist@@ leb@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employers had hop@@ ed that continuing positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility at training , education and gender pay attention to the Ministry of Education , Health Education England and the Ministry of Health in compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a £ 2 @-@ per day medicine that can reduce the heart attack
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thousands of heart attacks are expected to benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medicine , after the Auth@@ orities have been recommended to continue this more people for a longer period of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or medicine drug reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the medication is given 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has already recommended a four years of taking in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has already recommended a four years of taking in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and one quarter of them suffer a heart attack or stroke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
heart attacks and stroke are caused by collecting fatty substances in the arter@@ ies causing problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the layer breaks out , it can cause blood cl@@ ots that j@@ ammed the blood flow up to the heart and thus causes a heart attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the blood cl@@ ots breaks , it may flow through blood flow and con@@ j@@ ure blood flow to the brain which causes a stroke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who had a heart attack already had to have a higher risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or that is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ c@@ ec@@ a and is mark@@ eted under the Bri@@ li@@ que trade name . reducing this risk by continuing the formation of blood cl@@ ots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the draft of N@@ ICE , which was released today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a daily intake of asp@@ ir@@ in for the next three years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , director of N@@ ICE health education institute continued : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention a quarter of all persons having suffered a heart attack or a stroke - often with a disast@@ rous consequences . &quot;
fear of a renewed heart attack may have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with asp@@ ir@@ in effectively contributed to the reduction of other heart attacks and stroke in people who had already had a heart attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by a preliminary recommendations from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the blood risk - is restricted to a period of up to three years . the draft recommendation will not recommend any treatment that goes beyond this period .
Culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ness allows to b@@ los@@ s@@ oms in Muslim regions
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year on leaving a government report for corruption from the office
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ness has led to a widespread vote in Muslim communities , like a anni@@ hil@@ ating government report today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Cab@@ inet member Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es att@@ aches to the police , election observation , and town buildings to have ignored the evidence of electoral abuse regarding eth@@ no and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former minister of integration and municipal government , which is now an Ant@@ corrupt government , said that the in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation of voters from religious motives is so bad that it should be prepared to protect bul@@ locks out of elec@@ tr@@ ins to protect it@@ ated voters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that voters should lead a identification with themselves , in order to prove their identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the moment a voters must merely call his name and address .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report proposes , does not remove clo@@ ak ink on the finger of a person if they hand up their vote , in order to prevent one another twice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he demands that the press should have access to municipal documents and decisions , not official comm@@ ees or work@@ groups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only for election fraud , but also the municipal government in front of the bro@@ ader corruption and financial bet@@ a@@ dish culture that will protect , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets Elections in the east of London .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , a special local court ruled that the current mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be shown on corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of its Muslim community , &quot; and that he would have brought his critics to silence with ra@@ cial and Islam@@ opho@@ bi@@ en@@ an@@ cies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man should have led &quot; his campaign on the basis , that it may be the relief of the Muslims to choose Him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to 300 voices were either du@@ bi@@ ous or the sequence of im@@ itation , with which one person cho@@ oses anyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of fraud across the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he expressed himself in particular al@@ ar@@ ming about the frau@@ dul@@ ent letters - among older members of the Muslim community , to vote for people to choose one candidates of their choice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the line to prove the identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his report it is called : &quot; as proof was appropriate that pressure on protection needs of some ethnic min@@ orities , especially women and young people in order to choose according to the will of the El@@ der , especially communities with Pakistan or ban@@ ister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions should have ignored such behaviour because of &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to the eth@@ no and religion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric asked 50 recommendations to clean@@ se the system , including the ban that political activ@@ ist mail documents must be stopped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report , which is drawn by Ther@@ esa May in consider@@ ations , demands also tough@@ er registration rights to prevent that the electoral directory for immigration and social bedding is used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
consider options to question voters in front of your choice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not remove the ink from the finger on the finger of a person , once they gave their voice to prevent anyone else cho@@ oses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
systematic checks on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications for an automatic selection of letters .
ban that political activists complete post@@ ings and envelop@@ es of w@@ allet .
the police put the powers to set breast@@ feeding stations in order to set security stations .
a bill of law made by the charge of in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation according to the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Law 1983 ) .
photographer in election stations .
requirements that only English can be used in the electoral stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intensi@@ fication of the training , to ensure that personnel are usually going through to the voters alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and it is surprising , that after the Tower Ham@@ let no claim has been filed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral court , Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for lit@@ arian and illegal practices , declared un@@ fit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to a number of reasons for in@@ sufficient , according to the high demands on the criminal proceedings - found guilty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; dis@@ covering &quot; of the election distri@@ butions of the Town H@@ alls .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the verdict in Tower Ham@@ lets of the last year was a warning signal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country carries a proud heritage as the mother of par@@ li@@ aments , but wor@@ r@@ ying and den@@ ying of some authorities threat@@ ening this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous dou@@ bl@@ ers of Olympic Games in Rio
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fans of the Olympi@@ ad 2016 in Rio won over the French cycling team Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot except the edge and band , which has proved to be an impressive concer@@ ting of the Du@@ og@@ ist of Cambridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olymp@@ ion@@ ic@@ in is by far not the only one of his own Ath@@ lete , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger , at least if one may not give the social media to faith . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces which are fli@@ ck@@ ering on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a lists of Olymp@@ ion@@ ics which have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood &apos;s survival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fighter and the wolf : crew member of the U.S. team at Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di Capri@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the cycle path , many people have been on the Internet to be like a certain bow@@ ing of the Di@@ dy@@ mus of a @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di Capri@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the team member of the U.S. crew in Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a look@@ out on Twitter , after which he looks similar to the wolf of Wall Street Star . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the arch@@ ery was ma@@ dness in the social media with and gave rise to hear that he had already been listening to his childhood when he looks like Leo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I see no great simil@@ arity with the exception of the facial hair &quot; Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; he is a good hand@@ some guy , so I think that is going to be a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ is@@ ons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus : the infl@@ ating simil@@ arity between the British wide @-@ spr@@ inger Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .

one step higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athletic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption Theater
another sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nice who runs similar to heavy eyebrows and lips .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Russian silver medal , Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova , points out more than only the sun @-@ fried skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne McC@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian from fans was att@@ un@@ ed to the same &quot; athletic version of Joseph Gordon &apos;s Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong women : soccer star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial form and eyes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy about it , that others might be the simil@@ arities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
theory is put into space : according to this user there may be one reason for the simil@@ arity of the Pa@@ ares .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user in explained their satisfaction , that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually , the US football star Hope has Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter an incredibly similar facial form and eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mac@@ Donald , which was brought into the comm@@ ent@@ ator team of the C@@ BS to give more &quot; colour &quot; , you could hear : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , Baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a pig was excited , he died as a pig . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; viewers in all countries responded quickly online , after they were shocked by the sound and the language . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ et - &quot; hat of C@@ BC comm@@ ent@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old flo@@ wery in China &quot; has died out of China &quot; ? ? ? ?

the criticism of Byron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard with him to talk about him
Twitter users didn &apos;t keep back when they listened to how in@@ sensitive Byron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter user in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; Wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let us look like R@@ assi@@ sts . # attached .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; short time later Scott Rus@@ sel , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald , said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the commentary has been broadcast over a swimming performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a un@@ fortun@@ ate formulation . we &apos;re sorry that it is happening . &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ olog@@ ised himself at the end of more than 90 times in people who have spoken on Twitter via Twitter
the commentary booth Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC , and added his exc@@ use with more than 90 other Twitter users , compl@@ ained about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the network ap@@ olog@@ ises itself quickly and issued a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret it properly , that these statements were made and that it was made possible to broadcast it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday night , we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers and our followers in social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to clari@@ fy one , By@@ at@@ ron &apos;s comments referring to the performance of the swimming pool and not to them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ adequate and a un@@ fortun@@ ate formulation . Byron does what he said , very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald was made in the show , trying to jus@@ tify his re@@ mark by saying that it was not his intention that it was made as personal attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment of time to make me exc@@ use for the comment , which I ap@@ ologi@@ ze after women &apos;s swimming pool in the C@@ BC Olympic programme . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I refer to the performance of the swimming pool and not related to them as a person . &quot;
of course no dis@@ regard was deliber@@ ate and I &apos;m very sorry about it . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark is ou@@ tra@@ ged by a woman who rehear@@ sed in the middle of business sham@@ eless under@@ wear
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the purch@@ aser did not know where to see , when a woman with@@ drew its clothes in the midst of a Pri@@ mark to give shelter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , they mu@@ stered how she looked in her , she moved and laid it back to the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you go on and tasted four pair of h@@ unters in a shop in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Mall in Folk@@ estone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Pri@@ mark business in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping mall in Folk@@ estone , in which the woman tested the under@@ pants after she put them back to the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ d@@ son , who was at the same time in business , said that she left the mysterious woman who left the under@@ wear and left the business without buying a little . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she said : &quot; people couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the situation , with@@ drew its own Str@@ umpf@@ waren , tro@@ users and tested them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not even try to find a somewhat dis@@ crete location to do it , simply because as O@@ sk@@ ar was standing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone died when they with@@ drew the under@@ pants again , who did not like it , as they put them in the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she repeated the same with three more under@@ pants , before she finally decided that her was nothing right did , and did it out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seemed not to distur@@ b that someone was watching or thinking about the person who would buy the lower in@@ ants that she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent said , &quot; How to think that someone would take a h@@ osen home with home that had a different person and they were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; as I got involved , the staff tries to draw the garments for sale after she went - what was just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate it to go home with a new pair of h@@ osen home and find out that another woman had her and she went out and not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man by the Pri@@ mark said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is the incident that occurred on Tuesday , August 9 at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a before arms
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com might make it more secure for you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we talked to Rh@@ one Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how one walks with armed taxes on distance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from the back , this video will show you how to turn around for your rob@@ bers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you be turned back from behind , you should spin yourself as a first , so you can see your att@@ ack@@ ers and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sei@@ ze the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit him with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beat him with knees in the womb and rotate it , while the att@@ ack@@ ers turns away from pain while the att@@ ack@@ ers move into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when att@@ ack@@ ers lined up from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the line , grab the weapon and rotate it , so the att@@ acker cannot shoot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , keep the weight on your gun and beat the att@@ acker on your chest , then turn the weapon out of his grip before moving back and raise the weapon on him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it does Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but remember that there is a rob@@ ber@@ y on the saf@@ est part to over@@ ride your money , if you are not a Kra@@ a Grand Master . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
travel@@ er Ian W@@ right sh@@ ab@@ t for a guide to his tongue in the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a British trav@@ eller , his immune system and wor@@ shi@@ ef@@ lex under@@ took a serious test - showing some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and ek@@ ky places in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the moder@@ ator and travel@@ er Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k sh@@ ab@@ ated his course on a but@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of its immune system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the disman@@ t@@ ling of each object he used a lumin@@ esc@@ ometer to show us and to show us what he will be in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the experiment , which was fil@@ tr@@ ated under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner @-@ th , &quot; brought some surprising results at daylight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thought , dis@@ gu@@ ise a pull shower , which was used by thousands of others , may be totally rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact in a kitchen sink more bad bacteria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals to promote gut bacteria and his own health . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
luck@@ ily nothing left all that he li@@ cked to his mouth more than a bad after@@ taste .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. W@@ right was known for this to test the resistance of his gut by travelling through the world , and forgot and ate wonderful things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from public funds to train stations till r@@ ins@@ ing of the toilets , the task placed his immune system definitely under a sample &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he said , &quot; After a kid I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health was concerned and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , Earth , wor@@ ms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film he was definitely just doing his reputation .
the only thing he refused it was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial spread showed a lumin@@ ance of over 4000 units .
compared to this the lumin@@ ance of lumin@@ ous hands is less than 60 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to refused , after their lumin@@ ous hands amounted to more than 4000 units , whilst fresh washed hands have a less than 60 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o produced the travel guide &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner @-@ th &quot; which shows the bacteria in different places like the bathroom
in the film he says : &quot; it comes to the worst that I sm@@ elled in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing dirt than that !
I don &apos;t listen to it here because it is inside .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner @-@ th &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturers of dairy products vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us which includes both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the support of gut bacteria and immune system .
vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new .
something that is fascinating to look and also explains the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we introduced mad bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings that we finished talking &quot; L@@ ass us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of just talk about the products , we wanted to present them to a larger context - the good and bad bacteria present in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary , we were able to provide more information in an interesting way for consumers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think also that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the direc@@ ting of the film , added : &quot; let me have lost my respect for Ian , if he had instructed him , the rus@@ sian toil@@ ette that is shown in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , there were things with which it was easier to bring Ian to lick them and others , with which this was quite difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats to film . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a survey conducted by 2015 , 84 per cent of all respon@@ dents in particular with the well @-@ being of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal and gut and 58 percent said that they may use at least occasionally products which contained lac@@ tic acid bacteria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ social family destroys the social settlement in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a as@@ o@@ zi@@ al family left their social settlement on a delay with a damage deposit of £ 50,000 because she had terror@@ ised her neigh@@ bors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash . Corn@@ wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after being viol@@ ently removed from her property , the housing estate acquired the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the walls had some holes , wooden boards were torn , tra@@ sh was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ffiti was lubric@@ ated to the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the family were res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that they are now living in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y who works for the house management at Corn@@ wall Hou@@ sing said that she was afraid that the apartment is no longer to be repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; It was a night@@ mare for people here and I am the view that people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are many things to take into account , since this property is probably considered as a nice part of Corn@@ walls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment meanwhile and the police said that the terror had given the family , street abuse , drug abuse , drug traff@@ icking and excessive cry , fight and curse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name stood on the lease , received an order of anti @-@ social behavior in June . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some rooms of the house that is torn under circumstances , ancient rub@@ b@@ ish was found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were tra@@ ded in the property where drugs were already tra@@ ded in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the neigh@@ bors said that she had to fight back on the street , and they regularly had to stop the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Corn@@ wall Hou@@ sing del@@ etes her and her partner this week for@@ ci@@ bly away from the property , after which she gave them a prolonged period of 11 weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Del@@ og@@ ation were che@@ ered by lighten@@ ed neigh@@ bors who told her life to hell .
one of them said : &quot; they turned no one . &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the countless times , which we say the police , are incredible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we could not sleep in the morning . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - that we are not unusual !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , where they are gone , it will become beautiful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adam Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement manager of Corn@@ wall Hou@@ sing said that it would have failed to cooperate with local authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the family lived in the house where the police was launched at regular intervals , 20 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tra@@ sh and old toys were thrown on the w@@ asted side of the Municipal House
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; it is a shame to take any responsibility for its behaviour and to accept any responsibility for their behaviour , as the final step is , the Corn@@ wall Hou@@ sing is taking into account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a very difficult case , as the behavior was extremely difficult and their deeds to be aw@@ ful for her neighbours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I treasure all the work done by my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the municipality , who cour@@ a@@ geous to us and have provided us the information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that these development will give a con@@ sol@@ ation to some neigh@@ bors and conve@@ ys the message that anti @-@ social behavior is not toler@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they should be all over 20 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a dirty mattress which is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after the Del@@ og@@ ation on the ground .
workers in the house management are now to bli@@ ster rub@@ ber@@ y which is surrounded by the house
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 , the police triggered a raid in the house and took over 70@@ g of cannabis and orph@@ an@@ ages , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ als and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Skel@@ don received a penalty after she had guilty of poss@@ essions of a class B drug in trading care .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it claimed that the money came for a tomb of their son Lee Skel@@ don , who joined a car accident in 2013 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after having been without a roof , T@@ anya and its partners are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many walls of the house were gra@@ ffiti .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police says that they will enter supp@@ lic@@ ants , who will not keep the assignment of the house rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela C@@ row from the Devon &amp; Corn@@ wall police par@@ ted that the Del@@ og@@ ation would be a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants , who do not hold on the assignment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can be@@ have without self @-@ prescri@@ ption and to those who were damaged by such a behavi@@ ours , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and social behavior , which continue to cooperate with partners to protect our communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists in Portugal is transferred to panic after an effective military jet is flying over
sun@@ an@@ bet@@ er in Av@@ eiro , Portugal survived the shock of her life
a portu@@ guese P @-@ 3@@ C Orion aircraft for air forces placed an incredible power flight
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Air Force presented that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that there was no security risk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the moment , in which fri@@ ghtened tourists start to panic , after a fasc@@ ist jet runs over a full beach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dramatic video recordings showed how the military aircraft flew almost within reach of sunshine on the beach of Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ers pointed out , when they hur@@ ried to take worry about the noise of the explo@@ sives , without first to see what the clouds came upon them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred yesterday in Costa Nova , near the Av@@ eiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Daniel Fern@@ an@@ des , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos on the dramatic secret Fly By in the social media , said : &quot; it flew two times very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; I was just right at the Surfing and it felt like that the aircraft would fall upon me . &quot;
tourists along the beach of Av@@ eiro were translated into panic when the plane came from the darkness and flew unbeliev@@ ably deeply .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today the Portuguese air forces came to identify the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Orion aircraft on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast , so that it had to know the only way to identify them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speaker said that the jet had a bit deeper because of the bad visibility , but the Air Force lack@@ ed that security at no time was at risk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surface fires destroyed this summer parts of the Portuguese town , with which four people came to death on the island of Madeira . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Portuguese air forces arrived today that the pilot had to fly over the conditions - strong fog and bran@@ ding , which had to fly as deeply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aircraft was on a training flight to identify the pilot fishing boats as part of the exercise .
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with wor@@ ries against Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - The FC Barcelona will fight for the first step in the new football season on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Catal@@ ans live in the battle to the spanish Super@@ cup , against the FC Sevilla , the back@@ play will rise three days later in Camp No@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dou@@ ble@@ win has to disp@@ ense with the sub@@ lime C@@ up@@ fin@@ alists and ruling Europe league champion amongst others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who will contest the Olympic football tournament with Brazil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andre was missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Germans suffered a b@@ anning value in the knee , which has been clari@@ fied at least in favour of Claudio Bra@@ vo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for two years , Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er Ste@@ aks w@@ ett@@ e@@ wor@@ ries have been one of the number one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coach Luis En@@ rique made a clear decision on this , but T@@ er ste@@ es in most other applications in most other applications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prior to the first mandatory game of the new playing time , there is a doubt about the fitness status of the squ@@ ad that was hum@@ bled on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool , with 0 : 4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even at the age of 3 : 2 in the Pro@@ par@@ al@@ opp against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. did not really convince .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sevilla again has 2 : 3 defeat in an extension in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and plans the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona is the winner of eleven races of the record winner in this applicant .
Ma long in a dedicated league to table tennis @-@ gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympi@@ ad .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old signed his comp@@ atri@@ ot and title defence of Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12.@@ 5.@@ 4,4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro .
thus the world @-@ ranking won the &quot; Golden Grand Slam &quot; with successes at the World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and just Olympia .
bronze went to the Japanese J@@ un Mi@@ ti@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it as expected in the final game and made the title among each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , it was clear that for the third time a Chinese would pick up the single title in the sign of five rings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last non @-@ Chinese on the top of Olympia was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Leg@@ ion@@ aire ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ma and Z@@ hang were left to the record alone , between sets and time @-@ outs they had no c@@ aches in itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had with@@ drawn on the tri@@ bun@@ e and left their paras@@ ites in a fair competition on each other .
&quot; I played the Mat@@ ches to here for my country . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final I played for me , &quot; Z@@ hang was fol@@ ly said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game awarded gold and silver medal winners with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly un@@ il@@ ater@@ ally .
Ma was really fighting with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent in the first movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , he set the pace to the disk and the slope had a total of 13 points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
through the su@@ peri@@ ority of Ma no longer developed the expected match .
but nevertheless there were enough stunning ball changes to be seen .
Mi@@ ti@@ ani won the match of bronze against the 40 year old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bel@@ ar@@ us@@ can had pulled himself in his quarter @-@ final against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , was subsequently in medical treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve WAL@@ DN@@ ER ( 38 / 2004 ) and J@@ ör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) were similar to the high table tennis age of Olympia @-@ V@@ ates .
Donald Tr@@ ump grants an enormous problems ″ in the election campaign
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership of the US Republi@@ can is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive wor@@ ries , also in traditionally conc@@ e@@ aled federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump handed over the weak@@ nesses of his campaign in the former rep@@ ubli@@ can strongh@@ old of Utah .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a rare moment , in which the usually large @-@ lane and self @-@ confident multic@@ ol@@ illi@@ ant had reported something like concerns such as correspon@@ dents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within his own rep@@ ubli@@ can camp , the doubts arise from his success in the struggle for the White House . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah , &quot; Tr@@ ump said before evangel@@ ical Christians , which he asked for support in important states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; again , guilt of false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy took him back his well @-@ known media reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rep@@ ubli@@ can arro@@ gan@@ ce w@@ aking
Utah is usually a secure bank for the Republi@@ can .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a survey of Sur@@ vey@@ ed USA from June , Tr@@ ump and its competitors from the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , con@@ ten@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other institutes look forward , but not with the distance that is common for rep@@ ubli@@ can candidates in the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview of the transmitter CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump came to the question as it would stop the rise of Clin@@ tons , &quot; just as I did so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if left behind . I will either succeed , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is doing nothing else as &quot; the truth to tell . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not rich for him at the end of the political correc@@ tness , that is correct , Tr@@ ump said further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to press reports , the Party of Tr@@ ump shall have threatened to sufficient funds for the support of his election campaign , it should not present a better ren@@ dition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of making the candidates of the Republi@@ can attack , stronger among the arms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Olympic : three Re@@ als in D@@ oping Test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a discipl@@ in@@ arian commission .
Ken@@ yan athletes threat@@ ens after the second D@@ oping aff@@ air at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a fraud control in a D@@ oping control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a coach home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the International Olympic Committee commissioned to set up a disciplinary committee in order to examine the case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an ken@@ i@@ lian function had announced that the former Spr@@ inter and today coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , found a urine sample under the name of the 800 @-@ metre @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was reported by the Team@@ line Ken@@ yan from the D@@ oping controllers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the IA@@ AF World Federation has searched for information about the case in order to implement his own investigations , a IA@@ AF spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an evaluation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the D@@ oping control station and signed himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ er and signed the sample and signed by Ken@@ yan Chef de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was owned by the ath@@ cre@@ dit@@ ation of athletes , which stood on the list of training controls in the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ I was in 2015 at the Beijing World Cup @-@ fourth over 800 meters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan Ath@@ le@@ tics group leader Michael Rot@@ i had been dra@@ fted by the Rio Olympics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is to be informed of the following D@@ oping tests for the state @-@ payments of his country .
according to media reports he report@@ edly been arrested in Nairobi at his return at the airport of Nairobi .
Kenya has long been under special observation at the IO@@ C following numerous D@@ oping links .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the announcement of the more than 2000 d@@ oping finish controls in front of the Rio game , an unusual note that athletes from Kenya and Russia was taken into the visor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in pre @-@ summer games in Brazil , the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping agency exercis@@ ed a lot of pressure on African country , an anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a functioning control system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law has been adopted a few weeks before the Olympia at the beginning of Olympia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , WA@@ DA has adopted Kenya from the list of countries whose d@@ oping control comply with the rules of WA@@ DA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kenya is regarded as a great runner nation .
the athletes of the country won most of the medals at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a series of television reports , the ARD was raised over and over again that in Kenya D@@ oping means they are easily accessible and there will be a considerable ment@@ ality of sport bet@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und requested a similar investigation in Kenya as he had asked her in the Russian athle@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could be proven that in this sport area nationwide and systematically lec@@ turers was used .
Russia &apos;s ath@@ oming were subsequently excluded from the summer games .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cecilia Bart@@ oli
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ Year , the Salzburg Festival explo@@ res the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Mary as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with it a surprising Cecilia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with orn@@ ard Bern@@ stein &apos;s master@@ piece .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the artistic director Cecilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music , and met with the role of Mary a teen@@ age mare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the orchestra , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Symphony Orchestra conducted the Venezu@@ elan poet Gust@@ av@@ o D@@ ud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we always say that they are very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody .
it is a wonderful mix of the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we have really found Bern@@ st@@ om music in our blood !
in this production Bart@@ oli plays a col@@ der Mary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she re@@ members with sad@@ ness to her lovers of Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
firstly because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says it in her song : &quot; I Fe@@ el Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I Fe@@ el Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is therefore clever , of course also na@@ i@@ v , and very passionate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she re@@ sembles me very , my Italian character that I have as a Roman @-@ in , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ ud@@ amel is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is so honour for us to work with her .
it is an immen@@ sely spacious person .
and Bart@@ oli gives the compli@@ ment back : &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one sees it in any of his movements , in his eyel@@ ids , it is his life ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a happy approach to life , that is very important at all ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; up to date : &quot; in this piece it is about pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we have gone the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ans took to New York , and the New York residents did not want them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are the same issues and they are just as meaningful as they were .
59 years later the piece is still relevant .
London Schul@@ maid who joined the IS in Syria was killed in Syria
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ adi@@ za SU@@ LT@@ ANA , one of three British school , left London in order to join the IS , he report@@ edly died in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that her family told her weeks ago from her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was pres@@ umed that they were killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ wark of the group in the country , reported to IT@@ V News on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SU@@ LT@@ ANA was 17 years old , and died after their family shortly after she had pre @-@ exploited the war and to return to England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can only hope that the only good in it is - as a reminder and warning to others , that these are the risks to walk in a war zone - people ever make this decision &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in February 2015 , SU@@ LT@@ ANA and two other choirs from the east of London came into a plane to Turkey , subsequently into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sult@@ anas family has been announced that they had married a ISIS fighter in Syria - and within a few months she became a widow .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he comm@@ ended Gar@@ land and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his team would not worry about trouble with a new candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Turkey : Kurdish church calculated with mass acc@@ urs@@ ed
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who does not fit and Erd@@ ogan lo@@ oted , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the end@@ ent of the Gü@@ len @-@ close Stiftung Dialogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kurdish government of Germany anticip@@ ates ten thousands of protection trying to escape from Turkey to Germany temporarily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the medium term may even become &quot; several hundred thousand , &quot; the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the hard prec@@ urs@@ ed of the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erd@@ ogan , after the attempt to recon@@ struct the Kurdish Community Germany , acc@@ urs@@ ed to Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term I resear@@ ched with tens of thousands of protection from Turkey in Germany , when the Erd@@ ogan regime is further fights against min@@ orities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; from Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government had covered short bur@@ geri@@ es against pen@@ alties , 500,000 Kurds in Turkey on the run . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the failed coup still sec@@ ular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will begin to start in Europe , if they continue to be supp@@ ressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that assi@@ sts himself refugees , produced refugees in their own country , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chief of Staff joined forces of Syrian Arab Arabs in Kurdish and in Algeri@@ an cities as well .
that Erd@@ ogan wants to raise the flow @-@ pressure onto the remaining Kurds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been exter@@ min@@ ated or distributed over the last hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also the CDU member . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the government of Defence demanded that the federal government has positioned themselves &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erd@@ ogan and his followers . &quot;
also in Germany a &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; is fought against Erd@@ ogan &apos;s critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months , I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement feared the escape of many Turks abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Turks would seek shelter in Germany , especially Kur@@ d and Op@@ position@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire@@ wall as a Gü@@ len follow@@ er destroys teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who does not fit and Erd@@ ogan lo@@ oted , is also sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way the Kem@@ alists and sec@@ ular people said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ close Stiftung Dialogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the paper reported on numbers at the Federal Ministry of the Federal Ministry , the Turks before the coup the largest group of political prosecution recognised asylum seek@@ ers in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the closing date June 30 this is 11.@@ 386 people and thus barely 29 per cent of all had been recognised ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2021 , the European Parliament will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the parliament parliament decided at the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because it is not so far until now it is not : summer holidays , heat and land conditions - this is bit@@ ing itself .
the locals who are to be convinced by the election fighters are on vacation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the travelers who are in the country are located on Use@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are no locals , so don &apos;t choose the country day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; practical problems occur : in the holidays they are hel@@ pers to spread the posters , fl@@ ing the ballo@@ ons , fl@@ ing fl@@ yers , and dri@@ zzle the end of the votes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until 4 September 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass even election propaganda past the people over . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot phase , if you can tell it all , has just started . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition must be afraid of his office .
the SPD , since 1998 the strongest party , is now in p@@ olls clearly behind the CDU .
how exciting is how strong new@@ com@@ er Af@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of the coalition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years of age and since 2008 , he has an almost un@@ remarkable v@@ ending struggle , one sees from its large posters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he travels through the land , distributed ro@@ ses and ch@@ atting a little with the people , just as it did his legendary word spontaneous predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise sailors get cold feet and ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel to blame the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , &quot; We create &quot; We are going to accelerate the asc@@ en@@ sion of pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CDU with its top candidate , the Minister for Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has witnessed how it is when you make a wrong time in the right choice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel invited to vote on large documents ; Merkel &apos;s election @-@ circuit is in the northeast .
but the target group did not agree that there were more local in North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority from other federal states , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary @-@ General of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently included in the NDR . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it too bad to listen out from other corners of Germany even Angela Merkel .
otherwise the North @-@ East CDU nevertheless wai@@ ves the usual conditions of choice in market conditions and in front of shopping centres with umbre@@ llas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , like co@@ ca@@ ine , plays only a minor role only . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also the Union has noted that you on the country sh@@ un@@ ting the base , that it must be very str@@ ingent , again to find a wire in the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will find it like the left wing of the SPD , the Gre@@ ens . hardly present in the lands of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the council of the CDU @-@ election of Kok@@ ert is self @-@ lar@@ tic@@ ism : &quot; you have to go there where the people are : Dor@@ s@@ est , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party needs to be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because much on the game stands he has called Sell@@ ering its SPD to a particularly committed campaign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in surveys , S &amp; D M@@ EPs took over 22 percent behind the CDU ( 25 ) and just before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the election in 2011 , the SPD is still won at 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent prior to the CDU ( 22 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the green and small @-@ party with seven percent in the p@@ olls can then be able to jump into the country day .
they make a modern virtu@@ e from the holiday of a holiday and disp@@ at@@ tain your election campaign large .
&quot; online election campaign &quot; calls it the presi@@ ding Claudia Müller .
otherwise green election fighters go on track search for local vocal ch@@ ords under the holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ ek , the top candidate , kur@@ t just with a house boat through the Mecklenburg @-@ duc@@ al lakes and also finds it beautiful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her impression : &quot; electoral holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is no penalty . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Ref@@ ur@@ b@@ ishment : gast@@ ro@@ wers suffer from blocking
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when quick to speed up to the B 27 , there is nothing to be square . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those responsible persons , which start at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and end only at 20 pm , there is no praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all these things have done pretty fli@@ p@@ ly &quot; &quot; El@@ vira T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the Jet @-@ gas station .
this is a super@@ team .
there is no default .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the building site could be moved to the south as soon as scheduled , until the end of October was finished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
v@@ ow is also comm@@ end@@ ed to the end of the work responsible for the construction work , e.g. when it comes to set up dom@@ es@@ in@@ ises .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the construction site was moved on Monday to south and also the lock on the road road in O@@ fan@@ d@@ ingen , so that the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is once again insi@@ sted and has relaxed the traffic situation within the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the citizens can now return from O@@ fan@@ d@@ ingen to the B 27 on both sides .
the exit of withdrawal by the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were partly considerable complaints &quot; says the representative of the responsible chief executive director Florian King .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the residents of the country road , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had sought to fight with more traffic noise , because many Sch@@ leich@@ sies were looking for and more of their Nav@@ i entrusted as the sign@@ age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what to do so many trucks registered in the areas of residence .
as well the speed limit@@ ings were not limited , the community rein@@ forces the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were considerable re@@ visions , &quot; says King , who made himself locally on the location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were already two to three per minute .
the quick release was on the pace with 77 hour kilometers in the pace of the pace .
since the construction site has res@@ umed but it became cal@@ mer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for business people at the B 27 , it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the road is open again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , that the B 27 rehabilitation with them led to sales qu@@ arri@@ es , everyone who asks you will look through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however some are some more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who has less to do with the &quot; end customer &quot; , so for other firms , hardly any consequences for the rehabilitation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even at the deal@@ ership Mai@@ er Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; maximum slight decrease , &quot; but also dreamed that of course it is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most exploited are the local along the street .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak house in the former crown , contains considerable words .
this is already exist@@ ant .
not only him . but all the restaurants have hit it hard . &quot;
customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen are lacking in Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we must be happy about every euro turnover .
the sales revenue is reduced to over 50 per cent . &quot;
the road separation started his operations &quot; by two years . &quot;
he did not have to release half of his staff .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released , politics had changed differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , President Jörg Schmidt has put on a request by G@@ öh@@ ner whether the inn would benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B . now they also have to carry out the draw@@ backs that arise through the rehabilitation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other land@@ marks in where such a kind of funding has been handled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , family business was located here since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that other regul@@ ars are due now due to complicated traffic management less frequently , he can understand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you cannot get back then it is also elsewhere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that his master cli@@ ent@@ ele under@@ goes back to the end of refurb@@ ishment , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the crises with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of the B 27 construction on his cli@@ ent@@ ele for the biggest crisis which has witnessed its hospitality in its long history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
six months of construction work is already brutal .
it is constantly bol@@ ted in the name of terror @-@ fighting against laws .
after recent attacks the interior Minister of Interior of Mai@@ zi@@ ère takes a thick security package .
but what does a toler@@ ation status have to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition party say to all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Recon@@ c@@ iler .
all of his proposals were politically reasonable to the coalition partner &quot; says the Federal Minister for the presentation of his new security package .
they call not anyone .
other further points would be discussed initially in the parties .
I also bet@@ s myself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but as Minister of Internal Affairs , it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; con@@ sensus within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , Mai@@ zi@@ ère takes a little time in drawing up his conclusions for the security in the republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the falling out therefore are the more extensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a lot has already been announced , announced that a new security authority must take care of the sn@@ acking of encrypted communication is not new . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement multiple EU def@@ aults and ar@@ mis@@ tice .
the call for more video surveillance and staff for the safety authorities is also un@@ surprising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; towards the part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère takes a second attempt to win with the SPD so far : he wants to make sympath@@ ies for terrorist groups and jihadists returning with double citizenship to the German pass . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; cle@@ ars the CDU @-@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he does not hold this anyway for reasonable and demanding anything in the coalition partner anyway .
a few new ideas presents de Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in part , they have partly : he plans for dep@@ or@@ tations and more possibilities for the imprisonment of human beings against expul@@ sion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugees , which are targeted towards the country , should let their smartphone wi@@ pes out and dis@@ close social media accounts for security review . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with slo@@ gan@@ s for previous asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse than previously - roughly those who commit off@@ ences or commit their papers to dev@@ ote their identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of them is political and legally resident .
it also functions un@@ balanced and leaves questions openly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of imp@@ ati@@ ence , for example - is the question : what has it actually done with security and terror ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , it says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subjects refugees and terror . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it cannot be put to talk that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
people also made wor@@ r@@ ying about security in the face of high refugee numbers .
and things that are deeply involved in humans are also not allowed to cl@@ amps in turn@@ out times .
the inner safety is enor@@ m@@ ously hidden in the focus .
first stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels and Nizza .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the amount of contamination is great .
and yes . there are choice fights .
the Union and SPD also increasingly contribute to the topic of inner safety .
in recent days it went up between both parties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only a gar@@ sti@@ ff dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then also concerning a security politi@@ cian of some Unions interior ministers , in which the Ress@@ orts also call a bur@@ ka @-@ prohibition and a return from double citizenship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère also flour@@ ishes here to con@@ cili@@ atory sounds .
from a return of double pass he does not hold anything .
we have ma@@ stered the discussion in Germany .
you are new to make sense . be not meaningful .
and in a Bur@@ ka @-@ prohibition he was un@@ constitutional objec@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether his own package is un@@ constitutional in all corners , and if it really is &quot; reasonable &quot; is for the coalition partner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there &apos;s something in what to fight for war .
but the SPD is still trying to pro@@ filing an inner safety on the topic of inner safety .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Part@@ n@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alizes a lot of conversation , saying : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to enhance safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nor comes Volkswagen gli@@ mp@@ ing through .
despite Diesel sc@@ and@@ als the delivery costs are rising worldwide .
but not in all markets it runs .
there is a phra@@ se for the back of the call .
Volkswagen launches itself in the second half of the deliveries abroad .
Europe &apos;s biggest coach may be further ahead in its previous year despite the diesel aff@@ air thanks to its many brands and some good running markets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in July , the nuclear brand was weaker and charged with the overall sales of the D@@ ax company in D@@ ax . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worldwide , the VW brand sold the VW brand with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars to 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales stood at 14 percent below last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the home market Germany involved deliveries of almost a si@@ bel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chief Apostle Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July , mainly to two sales days less in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
additionally it was given a department store in some core markets by &quot; changing economic conditions . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the situation around the attempt at the coup in Turkey , the British vote also charged the withdrawal from the EU explained a speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the U.S. , where the exhaust air is calculated first , there is also a reserve of beech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , the mainly affected house brand of the Nieders@@ achsen res@@ cent further by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only a delivery minus 0.@@ 9 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles will be made in beech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
head of Group Fred Kap@@ pler was able to further point up a sales growth from January to July .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this period , 1.3 percent more vehicles delivered in this period , with 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software exhaust tests .
in Germany alone VW is calling a 2.5 million truck to retro@@ fitting to the workshops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the course of re@@ arm@@ ament , VW backed that the conversion of cars did not have negative effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after retro@@ fitting of the vehicles , fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power does not have any deteri@@ oration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bus stop for the customer after dis@@ arm@@ ament a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but did not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was called on Friday in business trips . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason are legal delic@@ ac@@ ies .
&quot; Focus &quot; had reported to have had its German customers a guarantee for heavy diesel models now .
we had confirmed this last Monday VW representative in the Federal Office of the Federal Office .
out of the ministry of the road was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; VW has filled the requirements of my Committee of In@@ quiry and the KBA . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations from the Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry is not accepted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has taken over the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power after dis@@ arm@@ ament no deteri@@ or@@ ations will take place and all type of type of vehicle remain unchanged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was named in business trips .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , in the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; , Volkswagen will see the possibility for example a half year after conversion with an engine damage in a workshop - and this might lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in customer interest it is important to avoid that there is nothing to do with the Ab@@ g@@ ass@@ ing andal , which comes with regard to possible warranty claims , as it was named . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore we do not use the term &quot; guarantee &quot; .
Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands its criminal charges in future due to rich banks - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; It is only allowed to park EUR 139 customers that use 40 million euros on checking or daily rate of money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German banks speaks of a single case , and does not see a signal : ordinary savings would have to be afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
store banks money by night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) must pay by 0.4 percent criminal charges .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fee demands Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund commen@@ ces retail and corporate clients for deposits over 100,000 euros on checking or daily monetary accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the first 100.000 Euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 will cost € 400 in the year , &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ski@@ pped 40 million euros , that could be with@@ drawn from one day on the other and could not be able to explo@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are at me in central banks and account at 0.4 percent cost , &quot; said the chef . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t lay up for every one million 4000 euros . &quot;
he now increases the costs after the caus@@ ation principle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cash simply can be seen in the saf@@ es of Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; I haven &apos;t seen four ra@@ ins , I don &apos;t want the fifth ! &quot; said the World Board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most customers have understanding and changed to other investment forms .
only a few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association of India explained : &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you alone are not able to carry &quot; business economically permanently . &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management , credit cards or transfers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with pen@@ alties for deposits from three million euros , the Thur@@ ing@@ ian People and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burg land had made head@@ lines for 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Michael Kem@@ mer , the Managing Director of the Banking Association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t expect that private clients have to pay for in@@ soles at the end of this competition in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bank@@ ers said , T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , there is &quot; a climate that is equipped by fortune a little m@@ illed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this can become a small bank with a problem . &quot; if they keep free money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; founded in 1911 , the comra@@ de G@@ aul was founded in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ ational @-@ E@@ fond , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
emin@@ ent actors and sports@@ men and entrepren@@ eurs live in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently no further banks are known to the co@@ operative association Bavaria , which will calculate a plant substitute for in@@ soles of private clients , &quot; said spokesperson Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the President of the Federal Association of German Commercial B@@ anks and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen banks ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had stated : &quot; the threshold into neg@@ atives &quot; is very , very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the competition is hard , and it threat@@ ens to mig@@ rate investors to competition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

destination plates : who really bu@@ ys discs ?
lon@@ ely men @-@ average age love plates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you go to the commentary box , to skip him under the p@@ seud@@ onym Non @-@ Eff@@ ective Co@@ ergy with rough ins@@ ults , this statement is derived from current data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the numerous re@@ formation of records is not able to welcome a boom in m@@ illenni@@ als that want to welcome the news of physical objects , but on Mid@@ life @-@ nostal@@ gia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who recently purchased a plate have a pre@@ view , between 45 and 54 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely shop@@ per . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no hor@@ des through hob@@ bies - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers will retain their feelings ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy their own time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this blog would be a news report on TV , I would carry my camera whilst in the midst of a busy road in S@@ oh@@ o , my hands keep my hands hold and somewhat better look like : &quot; so , let us take a closer look to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if the heart of So@@ H@@ os eat slowly at his char@@ me - hotels , restaurants and offices are now complete the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a hand@@ ful of fantastic turn@@ tables . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would probably ask the camera to switch the camera for the next part , in which I am standing in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to appreciate its age and minds by observation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 me whom I am von Si@@ ster Ray ( data count : two men middle aged ) into the recur@@ ring Records ( data count ) is one day long because of a meeting in London and walks through the shops to fill the couple of hours .
is he a collector I ask ?
&quot; I already appreciate &quot; he says .
I have about 3.000 or 4.000 plates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these sound records , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I am not followed at home ) , dressed in the walls of his living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason why he has such a substantial number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : it is now able to buy records when they appeared and again buying the objects which he sold , when he was young and ple@@ ite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things that I buy , are out of the late 60s , early 70s , which was when I was 11 or 12 . things that I was probably too young to buy her . &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is true that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and gladly spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I am not drinking too much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is my charge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers can meet at the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he has also noticed a new wave of people who have heard about the com@@ eback , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and release their old records . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the talks I have led , people usually have dra@@ fted away from their collection in 1998 or 1999 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , sell their CDs to buy their disks again , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would explain the boom of tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica , to recognize that record transactions offers a soothing community of par@@ ables . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to WE@@ Z , some of the older clients participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some new@@ com@@ ers are overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to re@@ trace the stability of familiar record covers , from objects to happy heart f@@ uses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material poss@@ essions as a kind of comfort , &quot; says WE@@ Z .
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to famili@@ arise oneself .
&quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; gather a staff from one plate stack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a survey of IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month , they haven &apos;t heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the survey also found out that 41 % have turn@@ tables they never use , while 7 % of those who buy one plate , don &apos;t have turn@@ tables . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time of the news report , I would probably look very worried as I had more than a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova com@@ bat@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men middle aged ) , has noticed an &quot; trop@@ hy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone came only recently here and said , &quot; I didn &apos;t buy record players , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead record , so that I can put them to the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage but it definitely happens .
more product class , less music @-@ class .
we have people who say : &quot; I have no turn@@ tables . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those are younger people , not older ones who come first slowly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lo@@ p , which has devoted to the sound of sound almost a whole floor , has an evil audience than I am going to clean . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make pictures of teen@@ age and women middle ages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the af@@ ore@@ mentioned businesses , Wild Be@@ asts New Syn@@ th@@ esi@@ ve and sex@@ t@@ packaged Pop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in place of experimental jazz dr@@ ills from the speakers , it is good to see such diversity among customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; none of them looks strange , but n@@ ag@@ ious psych@@ osis is hard to mount when one stands next to someone over 30 seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around the store for several minutes and focuses the variety of records for sale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it rather makes a bucket seat more than a big one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she doesn &apos;t deser@@ ve much , so there is no real option to collect records . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it costs much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s easy to hear music from one computer or any other way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it drives with a de@@ vised si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my last stop is a shop , of which is said that a new generation of record @-@ lovers have been inspired by the urban con@@ fit@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while I enter the licence , I observe a group of young artists who want to group in a moment around pol@@ aro@@ id cameras , before a father and daughter thought to buy a Cro@@ ley record players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the left is a stair@@ well , a wall full of records of Adel@@ e , J@@ eff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody looks at her - maybe because they are purely decorative , some as far as it is impossible to touch her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is pure &quot; plate of art . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but considering that each attraction for these objects means more money for the industry and could send a few customers to the depths of So@@ H@@ os for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no surprise that a population group who has more time and money than others , also that is the most suitable for luxury objects like plates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if my research goes to vote that the results of You@@ Go@@ v will vote that , at least in record transactions in S@@ oh@@ o , they exist in reality , store stores and online forums . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are working hard in school or offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they spend their Thursday morning with security not with the bo@@ asting through board stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while star@@ ing over the shoulders of middle aged over shoulders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

French Court leans Offer about demol@@ ishing of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a French dish was rejected by authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during a hearing divine service this week argu@@ ed in Cal@@ ais that the state should be merged to sell 72 provisional operations in which persons offer within the warehouse goods , from cigarettes to energy drinks , sell , hair@@ dressing services or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ecture argu@@ ed that these places should be torn down , because they would have paid a parallel economy that would not be paid for a fire and risk of fire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court and humanitarian groups shared that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups will not provide enough food for growing numbers in the camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , they carried out that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the training of people who would have the 72 provisional shops , but cleared the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that the grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role as only people live in extreme pre@@ cli@@ matic conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas are quiet for refugees between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the places that was threatened by the low@@ land was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café des Camp , non @-@ profit and French classes , as well as consultation for asylum , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors within the camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over 170@@ ,000 people signed the petition to keep the Kids &apos; Café . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was that the closure &quot; would be a catastrophe more than the youngest eight years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two auxiliary organizations help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ revi@@ ved on Friday , that the number of people in the jungle camp has risen to over 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of new arri@@ vals over the summer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the en@@ forcement trailer
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany &apos;s Ras@@ er must adapt to the next generation speed@@ ometers : in several federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash@@ devices will be tested , which should effectively be effectively transferred . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the futuris@@ tic en@@ forcement of the Vit@@ ronic company in Wiesbaden can be used for example to accident points , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measuring from the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , on highway building sites or to san@@ itation , there are often no unnecessary infrastructure to ensure that with a stationary shar@@ pen@@ er for resp@@ ecting the speed limit@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a lasting mobile body can be too dangerous or costly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is autonomous : its battery lasts five days , the case data are encrypted using a modem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all vehicles can also be collected at the same time using laser measuring technology .
variable speed limits and access options after time , travel strips and vehicle class can also be super@@ imposed .
in the very busy state you can move the trailer according to manufacturer with a trailer hit@@ ch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so that he is not simply pro@@ cl@@ ed , it is lowered in the measurement mode so that the wheels will disappear in the ar@@ mo@@ red and also the outer shell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you should also protect the built @-@ in alarm system from v@@ and@@ alism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested and used by Vit@@ ronic in various Länder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

great Britain picks up silver in 7 star ru@@ g@@ by car after teleph@@ ony Master@@ class Gold .
the impressive performance of Great Britain at 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by came to a ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of fi@@ j@@ is when they were hit in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ od@@ oro Stadium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fiji divided a master@@ class on the handling , side step@@ ping , desc@@ ending , run and ro@@ her strength to win gold - the first Olympics of any color . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the not too bad Tro@@ st@@ Award of silver medal , Britain was very proud of that day - and they were able to be quite proud of their efforts in which they struck the New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back in the final . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but independently of that Fiji on this form could have been a 15 @-@ man team .
it could be a comfort for a comfort - but it will probably not be that at least a gold medal around his neck will be hanging : Fi@@ j@@ is boss trainer Ben Ryan pointed at the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult way behind .
eight years ago she lost under Ryan of any game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sevilla .
here they lost only one .
this fla@@ p is going to hurt , but the progress is amazing .
Fiji started wonderful and sh@@ ook the attacks of fun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell , and Co. in the running buses . the World Series winners were going on top 5 @-@ 0 upwards , when Santa Maria Kol@@ om@@ is@@ au moved in the corner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with four minutes of playing time , Jerry Tu@@ wai added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely set the ball .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a h@@ ack@@ ra@@ ging T@@ ack@@ le of Mitchell , the mountain of man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa saw a third goal , but there was only on Fiji . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the seventh minute , J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua did a touch down in the right corner and there was 0 @-@ 17 for GB . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re @-@ ti@@ ff and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ dated by further weak T@@ ack@@ lings of the GB Teams , stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if Fiji was born to play 7 , while UK is still studying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is like that too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; UK introduced fundamental changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ ian gap ... for about four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time to Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova carried out after a brilliant inter@@ play by Fiji . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dan Norton launched an attempt for UK , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was long in favour of the South se@@ ein@@ sul@@ ans who sw@@ ings and d@@ anced on the grand@@ stand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not hard to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame placed the cake cake with another attempt in the last few seconds .
the wh@@ ist@@ le whis@@ k , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and GB k@@ ick@@ te cut down in the grass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past on the day , Fiji was defeated in the semi@@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain in a c@@ run@@ chy half match from the race - Great Britain conversion of difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive demonstration and scored a gate under the post in the second half . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a brilliant tro@@ ck@@ ling from Marcus Wat@@ son , brother of Anthony of the British 15 @-@ seaside teams secured the win - and thus the silver medal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning through the fight with the cancer of the trainer for the rowing @-@ win
there will be no burnt gold than with these games and that is what you want .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the first stro@@ kes to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve that enter into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional significance in her golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even though it was only the parents who were sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams was all@@ ot@@ ted to the second Olympic sport in a row , the first women in the history of the British Sports that were on such a scale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their domin@@ ance was absolute , after which their 3@@ 9.@@ ter is un@@ strug@@ gling , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we see are two brilliant ath@@ lete , who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of weak@@ nes , which is not the type of triumph@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behind every gold in rowing , a batt@@ ali@@ on will contribute to willing hel@@ pers that make the difference and no one knew how he would not survive this day at all , when it was diagnosed with cancer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as he said he ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer that is oper@@ able and they did .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not do this , it spreads over everywhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been quite a bad situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trio were lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of the season that was able to start a minimum , if that was the real term in such circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I needed money so I had to go back again soon .
it was an incen@@ tive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was at the hospital and ran around at the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is how it begins .
rowing to itself is a challenge - but this makes it a bigger one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in in@@ fertility of the victory , her first thoughts moved to Williams that has a ner@@ ven@@ ous tomorrow to talk a little more than usual , trying to process his own fears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ anning , which was as captain in the Royal Arti@@ ll@@ ery regim@@ ent in a deployment in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week an emotional wreck . that is perhaps a bit extremely , but it means a lot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it repe@@ ats only how much I mean , how much I and Helen and even Robin worked with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Robin we would be no one , and a massive thanks to him . he is the best trainer in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not have had any better person to exercising or wish them a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost a race in the last five years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the couple had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents could not keep up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much to reserve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were very caught at the moment .
Helen called &quot; stay in the process and remains in the process . &quot;
it is really important to get stuck together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had a good start and at the same time , we weren &apos;t looking out to make something great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we wanted no fireworks , we just wanted to get out and win the race what we did . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about its future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week at a wedding and your own with the TV adv@@ ent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I would not say that it was my last race .
this would have meant too much pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in London , it took about six months to realise that I am a Olympic win . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better . &quot; she said .
31 years exemplary for clarity :
the manager of the water purpose &quot; V@@ eit@@ ing group &quot; - Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , is reti@@ ring .
the association is considered &quot; Bavarian far exemplary . &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian pot@@ able water association as an example for the great water producers .
this is how it was in the original in a post by the Bavarian Radio .
little later the water forum was accused by the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia .
the work of the v@@ eit@@ ing group was &quot; Bavarian far as exemplary . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the forced association , has 28 years as managing director . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was now retired at the age of 65 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pot@@ able water association of the V@@ eit@@ s congregation , based in K@@ ott@@ endorf , municipality of Breit@@ brun@@ n , takes about 150 000 cubic meters of water each year and provides 32 locations and ham@@ let with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; affili@@ ates are the churches of Kirch@@ der , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current President , Breit@@ brun@@ n &apos;s Mayor in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) announced that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed as a Aqu@@ arian in 1985 and was appointed General Manager of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband ( 1988 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water @-@ line construction and maintenance work , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency payments on weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an outstanding event it called it the commissioning and initi@@ ation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) and compensation of farmers in the new fountain ( 1998 ) and re@@ building of the new fountain ( 1999 ) and the creation of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the re@@ organisation of water pipes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no down@@ time , and I have always received new changes because water is saving water and drinking water the most important food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her Lau@@ da@@ ti@@ o she praised her to G@@ ö@@ ll@@ ers , reliable and correct service over the age of 31 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has used himself with a lot of heart bl@@ rage for his water purpose , and having tri@@ cked the water ex@@ pe@@ dient , as if it would be his own company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few weeks ago he was present as a real practition@@ er to present the success of the v@@ eit@@ ing group for nit@@ rates before the Water Forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia area .
for that he received so much appreciation and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller s@@ rie@@ b Se@@ al Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked together with him for 28 years .
he is the best water@@ - and he was a faithful guy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
in his point of view he called the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the restructuring of the Zw@@ eck@@ Association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the biggest challenge and the most difficult deployment were at the high container at church lou@@ der on a 3rd January . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , at minus 17 degrees to work all night , the loc@@ alities with water could be supplied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you can only keep the supply of Neu@@ brun@@ n one once only , because you filled the elevated tanks of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management of the pot@@ able water purpose was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who will follow Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko is openly about with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago , referring to other concerned parents : &quot; you have to have courage to speak about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the medicine made great progress , &quot; the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper &quot; Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a &quot; said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the disease had been recognized by her son , she believed they had to die . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago did well forward and learn private in New York , where the best therap@@ ists give . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give an example , I ask him something that two years back when I sang in the Scala Milan , he reminds himself of nothing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he is the most happy man on earth .
Ti@@ ago comes from Net@@ reb@@ k@@ os together with the b@@ on@@ bar@@ it@@ one Er@@ win Sch@@ rott .
she is married with the tenor Y@@ usi@@ f Ey@@ v@@ az@@ ov .
relationship in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man sho@@ ots on life at risk
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old husband had shot at his partner in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) at his partner in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man has called himself to us and given his life to be shot , &quot; said a police officer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ r@@ ator is on the run after him will be made publicly .
from now nationwide , because Sven S. could be on the road by car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man is about 1.@@ 80 meters tall , muscular , brown , and has a gl@@ itter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile the police have published a photo of him .
this is a few years old .
meanwhile the man we@@ ars a gl@@ itter .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still wear the weapon in himself like the police .
who can see Sven S. will call the 110 .
the police speaks of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 and the perpet@@ rators in 1981 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , the Police in Lü@@ beck wanted to make no claims relating to the ather@@ land or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is a killing of killing . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t say more at the moment &quot; said a police officer in Lü@@ beck .
eye @-@ testi@@ fying was a special police unit ( SEK ) at the crime scene .
steel - Licht@@ blick for Deutsche Steel industry
the crisis @-@ exploited and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed of additional costs in million@@ aires .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial bur@@ dens , which made the branch from the oil extraction system , are from the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it remains in the liberation from the renewable energies laying to the so @-@ called nuclear production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West German general newspaper &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m really happy that we could finally reach tough negotiations after two years . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission is initially planned to use steel manufacturers , the gases coming from the high oven for electricity generation for their own consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year according to data from the German industry @-@ industry .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z ; it now calls for a policy of principle with the EU Commission on convers@@ ations with competition Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only when the generators are replaced in the steel plants , an EEG real@@ location fall by 20 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also this will not be raised in the steel industry .
in Germany the IG Metall welcomed the agreement with the European Commission for the world of business .
the status Quo of the previous regulation is largely re@@ written .
special importance have the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; regarding our campaign &quot; steel is the future &quot; is that a first step . &quot;
&quot; more need to follow . &quot;
&quot; the IG Metall @-@ Chef Jörg Hof@@ mann stated in Frankfurt in regard to the reform of emissions standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel branch in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the situation deep@@ ens further than the world &apos;s largest producer in China given the world &apos;s weaker domestic demand on the world market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
European producers throw Chinese steel concert performance .
in the course of this spring the situation has something relaxed .
for one show objec@@ tor tari@@ ffs on imp@@ ste@@ els effect to others have led the economic outlook in China .
it is un@@ clear how sustainable economic recovery is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
the prices would last again have been stag@@ nating .
the sector respon@@ ds to difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp also wanted to exclu@@ de the closure of individual works .
in the German steel industry there were around 8@@ 6,000 people employed at the end of 2015 .
German steel producers remain careful in July despite rising prices and increasing orders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they produced approximately 3.4 million tonnes , a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the economic Association for the Friday afternoon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a short increase in May , the crowd went back to another in the second month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the production increased by two percent since the beginning of the year .
the association counts in the coming months thanks to an improved order book with an increasing cost .
community , Spirit , Health : singing the Sen@@ iors Re@@ ally
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the singing has accompanied her whole life : as young girl she was put in school choir , in the Leh@@ ra@@ mt degree , she took the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; singing me - emotional and physical . &quot; she describes it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a sample she feels balanced , cheerful and a total of living , says she . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by the way she does something good with her health and mind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for singing , there is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Erhard Hack@@ ler from the German senior league . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most sen@@ iors singing in the ch@@ orus and sharing the joy of the music he describes Hack@@ ler .
through regular gathering sen@@ iors can establish social contacts and nour@@ ishment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because there are often social and family structures in old age , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this experience also made author Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to arrange and organize , to rely on the other and to learn from another - a choir is a very special form of mer@@ its . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be stren@@ uous as a h@@ acker .
for so sen@@ iors exercise a deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly demands the lungs are not as fast as the pu@@ rest in everyday life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if it comes to the sound of voice in age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in elderly people , there is often a very special effect , Ursula L@@ enz says of the Federal Employment Foundation of the Sen@@ iors organisations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the older generations , the common singing had a much higher value , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ enz frequently observed that singing or hearing of songs in elderly people w@@ akes many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their teen@@ age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lyrics and particularly melodies ad@@ mir@@ ing themselves to the rebel@@ li@@ ous events of long forgotten events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you sing , the head is charged a special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time to focus on his own voice and to a given rhythm , and adapt to other singers - that is a great cognitive challenge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially older people , who live solely live , practice not only to focus on themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another positive aspect is the recognition that one drives by singing in the ch@@ orus falls .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em is also growing by singing in the choir .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to show yourself : if I do something for something , I become better and wa@@ xy over me - this experience is strengthened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good reasons to begin with singing , so there is enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to try out a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he thinks little talent , t L@@ enz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one doesn &apos;t sing alone - with 50 sin@@ king people , who li@@ stens to those who are listening to a sound ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
looking for a suitable offer you have sen@@ iors different ways , says Hack@@ ler .
someone out of the familiar circle in an old ench@@ il@@ ench@@ or can be connected .
many cities also offer views of the choirs in the area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to sing in a church choir , can contact the church or the church leader . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet .
anyone who has no access to the Internet may ask the family , friends or neigh@@ bors to help with the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to sing , should necessarily join a ch@@ orus , says Hack@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing the soul well and has a bit of liber@@ ating - that is true for every age .
cats react to sensitive as a cat on the k@@ itt@@ y of the k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover in which effect the calls of cat bab@@ ys on adult animals have studied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to her surprise , the male didn &apos;t let the male too cold - however , they beha@@ ved like the female always the same . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
female cats can recognize the reg@@ ression of cat bab@@ ys on mi@@ ths of the little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they respond to ten percent faster on lute from k@@ itt@@ ens , who chose from the medical School Hannover Medical School and Medical School Hannover ( MH@@ H ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
aters also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always equal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously the acoustic differences between mi@@ xes of less and severely due young ones for the males were either not perc@@ eivable or not of meaning , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of MH@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first author published in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology &quot; on this Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a previous study , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens @-@ cry differs from the ur@@ gency of their emergency needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a total of nine adult tom@@ cats and eight cranes were observed from the MH@@ H animal hus@@ band@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were played for a herd of little ones , which were taken for three minutes from the saus@@ age and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the other , they were faced with cri@@ ckets of stronger k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised in addition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the researchers keep their results in spite of the small sample for meaningful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who had no own offspring , re@@ acted only the notes , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned swi@@ ft@@ ly to the speakers when this ru@@ ffle gave the k@@ itt@@ ens to the k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may be con@@ genital or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males had responded to all , &quot; said the Bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men for babies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , some studies showed that women responded positively in infants , no matter if they were already mothers or were not reported in the Bi@@ ologist Marina She@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ sky with &quot; gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ g@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant was issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r in Turkey .
he is accused of being a terrorist group .
the first time after the attempt at the coup attempt in Turkey an important soccer game takes place in Turkey .
in front of the Du@@ eling of the Erz@@ riv@@ als between Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ skis Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya the official line is obvious : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already in July , the government , the everyday life of normal vou@@ chers should not be imp@@ aired by lack of emergency in July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this does not apply to those who are suspected , to be responsible for the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the attempt of the coup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not possible even before the football .
the public pro@@ secutor issued an arrest warrant against the former star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ g@@ r .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the now living in America , South America was accused of being a terrorist group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sü@@ kis@@ sed shall be followers of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt by the President Recep Tayyip Erd@@ ogan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although this is true for 90 days , the emergency condition is still valid until October , although most of the Turks would be as good as no effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the n@@ igh@@ tly &quot; democracy guards &quot; on public places throughout the country , Erd@@ ogan is announced on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - as the whole country - divided into charm and opponents of earth .
especially fans of the workers &quot; Club Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as are traditionally not among the friends of the President .
but what the Gro@@ s of the Turks gave in view of dramatic experiences in history is the strict re@@ jection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans themselves - no matter if their heart beats Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as .
in the event of Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; gala &quot; it will be really coming to Luke Po@@ dol@@ sky again .
the Cologne Hall presented its sporty value in the past season : with 17 fo@@ ols and nine templates in all competitions this 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first time @-@ run as Top@@ sc@@ orer of his association .
he achieved the 1 : 0 victory @-@ buffer in the final game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce .
the newspaper &quot; Fan@@ atics &quot; rejo@@ iced him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an outstanding fashion and secured the trop@@ hy for his team .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; the dis@@ appo@@ inting season for the record champion felt a con@@ cili@@ atory graduation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after round @-@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; will be distinguished in the Europa League . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the South of Li@@ g it only ranged in sixth place .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; we have done this and that is the most important thing : &quot; Po@@ dol@@ sky said .
the game year ran better for Master Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , the starting with 26 season ten@@ sion@@ ers as an Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ cher , laid the basis for the 14th title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans will continue to return to the return of the 31 year old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the process of the AC under contract and at Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as , the Gom@@ ez only announced that the political situation in the country did not return to its EM @-@ holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario has come to us , he only has to say it , &quot; zi@@ pped the magazine &quot; K@@ icker &quot; Club@@ chef F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to do this , the storms should be willing to disp@@ ense for around one @-@ third of his annual sal@@ aries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his salary in Florence can &apos;t pay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite d@@ oping : these athletes have still medals chances of Olympic Games in Rio
the 34 @-@ year old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was locked twice for d@@ oping ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ mere in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa must not start in Rio .
other super@@ vis@@ ing Ath@@ le@@ tics sinners can only laugh - they are fighting in Rio to med@@ alli@@ ons .
the topic d@@ oping determines how the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
the Russian Schwi@@ mmer in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , who had compl@@ ained after a D@@ oping lock her first right in front of the Games was loos@@ ed and spra@@ yed at her start ( 100 m chest ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was offered a l@@ ur@@ r@@ ile scenario : with a set smile , she was still proud in the hall and prov@@ okes her appearance with her appearance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a festive thing they won &apos;t get gold ; the audience broke out in a look@@ out tower .
but there are still numerous sports@@ men who go to the start despite D@@ oping past during the Olympic Games in Rio .
here is an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 m season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the controversial figures in the athle@@ tics .
he has already been locked for two times due to Dop@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since his spell the Olympic champion from 2004 and ex @-@ world champion runs even faster than before , it is more than 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the greatest challenge of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fra@@ ser @-@ Pr@@ y@@ ce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ month se@@ aler and seven times world champion had to sit out in 2010 after taking the taking of the pain caused by Oxy@@ co@@ don .
she had a strong to@@ ot@@ ha@@ che after surgery . the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the Olympic champion of 2012 , world champion of 2013 and European Championship was positive tested for meth@@ yl hex@@ an@@ amin from 2010 to 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Per@@ kovic denied the in@@ qu@@ eting intake and was locked for six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est throws this year go to the account of the great gold ef@@ av@@ ori@@ tin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ rode ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 m season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two current World Champion over 400 m , was closed in 2010 and has been closed for 21 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a remedy would have been responsible for penis enlargement .
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m of the fastest in the world .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ smith , Belarus ) : hardly any of the athletes have been subsequently recognized as many medals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2005 , T@@ ich@@ on lost his championship title from 2005 to nine years after having been as@@ cer@@ tained at testosterone oping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to leave Olympia @-@ Silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid Dop@@ le@@ ings and the EM title in 2006 , because of testosterone abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also recognized the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympics as a result of an investigation of the International Sport@@ ral Tribunal ( CAS ) .
at 80@@ ,@@ 04 m he is ranked in the ranking two of the world ranking .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km ) : the world Chancellor and Gold@@ av@@ ori@@ tin has only been tested positive in May but may still start in Rio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the 29 @-@ year old world world championships , indications of an forbidden food supplements have been accounted for by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency WA@@ DA and ran from July 13 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bom@@ b@@ ent@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian inf@@ rin@@ gement - Sever@@ al dead
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stood in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man for the Foreign Ministry , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday afternoon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they had suffered ill@@ nesses and be treated in hospital , but I have already been abandoned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her home journey is planned for early September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket and in the southern towns Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ on also are also concerned , is still un@@ clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the State Department of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities as well as snor@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at some 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in was first planted on Thursday night in a Nightlife two bombs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the police , a Tha@@ il@@ ateral was killed and approximately 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friday early , two bo@@ unds were once again high , according to the authorities a further human being killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ph@@ u@@ ket also a bomb explosion was reported in the morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the det@@ onation of the popular Ba@@ dest@@ al Pat@@ ong , after police report , was report@@ edly injured as a taxi drivers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the Southeast Coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , which killed an urban legend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the explo@@ sives have passed into the air according to the authorities in a flor@@ ic@@ et in front of the territory of the coastal police .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , det@@ on@@ ations required in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south west coast as well as in Ch@@ om@@ on on the southeast coast several injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you go from a connection with explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , called it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks carry the same manuscript , &quot; said Army General Dan@@ ai crit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee , Friday morning from journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may be too early to manifest themselves to possibly sorts of motives , it is probably the deeds of Muslim rebels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern of the attacks , which is typical for the bom@@ ber of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Thai police declared that the attacks would not be linked to Islam@@ ist insur@@ rection or with international terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only limited to sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one pro@@ claim that the bombs were placed by the opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the past few days , the authorities have maintained secrets of upcoming stops in the south of the country - but they did not have been informed about the exact date and places . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nor be un@@ clear to the group behind the attacks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police reported their officials in the whole country to enhance safety around major governmental buildings and airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Thailand , there are always minor bom@@ b@@ ings , but they usually do not focus on tourists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used by the year of Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after desp@@ air explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends to make the instructions of the Thai security authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
high security risk ( security level 3 ) applied for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ l@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its surroundings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after disputes between the security forces and Muslim population , there is not recommended about travelling throughout these provinces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applied for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday a few days after a controversial referendum on a referendum held by the military jun@@ ta .
this cle@@ ars the military great influence in the coming years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jun@@ ta chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ CH@@ A said , the bombs have been a try to stimul@@ ate chaos while moving towards stability , improving economic situation and tourism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the military un@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody uph@@ e@@ av@@ al , has with@@ drew himself to stability and order to maintain the kingdom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the military does not have managed to get a grip in the extreme south of the country since years in the extreme south of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the conflict there were already more than 6@@ 500 people killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost a year ago , in Bangkok at a stop at a popular Hindu @-@ shr@@ ine , 20 people were killed - most of them are foreign tourists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the bloo@@ dless attack of the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; has become the visor of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after several regional associations , the constitutional complaints in the covenant have also been under observation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ clu@@ es &quot; for Best democratic principles &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said The German press agency Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diff@@ used in an extrem@@ ist way .
therefore we observe the movement as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; identity movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; multic@@ ul@@ tur@@ alism , it turns against &quot; multic@@ ul@@ tur@@ alism &quot; and &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; and the &quot; loss of identity &quot; by alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , H@@ esse , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thür@@ ingen - see the &quot; identity &quot; already . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ate said that his authority do@@ cked up with the country &apos;s decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &apos; identity movement &apos; attempt to pick up their target group , where it stands , &quot; said the constitutional director . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generally , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to speak with you@@ thful languages , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Islam@@ ists do as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts as well .
this is not a stun@@ ned advertising for its own thing .
propaganda is supposed to be emotional .
young people are particularly vulner@@ able in this manner .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last from several federal states , it had given reports on contacts of &quot; identity &quot; to Af@@ D politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ate said that he had no findings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the Verfassungs@@ schutz , possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it comes to whether the relevant party - in this case the Af@@ D - are determined by certain people , the most extrem@@ ist and extrem@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important to whether such people have a tax@@ able influence on the parties .
this is not recogni@@ zable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a view to the significant increase of legal off@@ enses and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee information , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak in this context not again of new right terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but we have established in recent years that there can be jus@@ tification structures .
there was the &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
it can be quite that further legal cra@@ cks or small groups form the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers who are planning against asylum seek@@ ers or attacks from other right wing extre@@ mis@@ m motives .
but a nationwide or European govern@@ ance control system is not recogni@@ zable .
the previous groups were written at the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; much worried about it , that many handles went to the account of people who did not enter into the right scene before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the wor@@ r@@ ying .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of the susp@@ ects in attacks on asylum claims were not previously known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated fel@@ lows or followers of the right scene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed off@@ ences , who had previously voted politically in@@ different or for example the CDU , SPD or Lin@@ ke , who have then radi@@ os@@ alized by right wing extre@@ mis@@ tic mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ its becomes an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine the Olympic or world records the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
that shows the bold appearance of RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ its at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center sw@@ am the easily over@@ crowded s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia , so slowly that he was no longer able to see in the TV pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it disappeared simply - no matter how far the neck@@ line was selected .
in social networks Hab@@ it was subsequently converted to viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old was finished with a reg@@ ression of 48 seconds and finished the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it was more , its not exactly sporty figure that attracted attention of international media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why does the 24 @-@ year old take part in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethi@@ op@@ ian was a special start to the international swimming pool .
this is distributed to make swimming in sub @-@ represented countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because in Ä@@ es@@ op@@ ies most sports@@ men run , Hab@@ te would just want to make something else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
preparing is all : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ its is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names make the lap quickly .
some media posted him as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL of the W@@ al . &quot;
based on a &quot; Well @-@ state &quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ id &quot; The Sun &quot; made fun of it with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his time , he only struck with a minute and nearly five seconds on the 100 @-@ meter fre@@ est@@ yle , played no role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
compar@@ is@@ ons to &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
the run of Eric Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i for media attention during the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unforgettable , the appearance of the Swi@@ ch from Et@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when it had to take over 100 metres of Freis@@ til alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in then Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year old learned to swim for eight months in front of Olympia and had never completed a long distance before the competition .

the consumer research company G@@ f@@ K drives his boss Matthias Hartmann .
the entries came suddenly - but not quite surprising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the difficult situation of the G@@ f@@ K market research company showed that the chair of board staff Matthias Hartmann is more uncertain , the longer that promised the success of his promised success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tur@@ mo@@ il at the top of the Nuremberg market research company G@@ f@@ K : after again dis@@ appo@@ inting business figures and the re@@ sign of corporate management is the Worldwide number Five in the sector prior to a personalized new beginning .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shall officially take over the function of a &quot; speaking voice , &quot; until a successor for Hartmann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company called the &quot; different views &quot; for the long @-@ term business orientation .
for details a company spokes@@ man did not want to call on Friday .
who will in future be le@@ ver@@ ing the market research company is still un@@ clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , on Friday , at the shareholders , it was last been dis@@ appo@@ inting the dis@@ appointment of the continuing success of the years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Hartmann is part of the G@@ f@@ K since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the fruits of restructuring have not yet been seen , however , it was named after 5 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the last bad G@@ f@@ K transactions the shareholders will eventually become un@@ quiet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this would be the case with BMW , the Qu@@ and@@ ts would do so , &quot; it was called . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following expenses in the preceding quarter , the company had failed to stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 36@@ 1.2 million euros , revenue fell by 6.1 percent below the previous year &apos;s previous year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

crash@@ es - bus sliding in cr@@ um@@ m@@ l@@ n in dit@@ ch : eight injured
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when an accident victim of a travel tour with 43 sen@@ iors than passengers have been injured by eight people on Thursday , in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ l@@ n ( Land@@ kreis Aur@@ ich ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the passengers suffered severe injuries and shared the police .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old coach of a coach from Eisen@@ ach had to leave her information in an opposite way , which drove part on the return journey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bus came to the right of the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , like a speaker of the Police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , the people could not leave the bus self @-@ independent , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade liberated the passengers .
six ambul@@ ances and ambul@@ ance came to the accident at the state road 2 .
the un@@ last travelers were brought back from a regular bus to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audible district P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
investig@@ ators demanded the load of skilled and possible witnesses to report on the police .
the fees per cubic meters of waste amount to 2.@@ 10 euros as of October 1st 2016 for the area of w@@ ast@@ ew@@ age system Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ ch . 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the waste water fee will be increased at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are needed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a covered calculation the age rate in Az@@ endorf is reached at 4.@@ 37 Euro per cubic meter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as mayor Bernd Stone Hou@@ ses , CS@@ U ) , has been noted , upon approval of the budget of the kul@@ mb@@ ach , to run for these se@@ wage systems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the market of Kas@@ endorf is oblig@@ ated to carry out the grounds of legal principles to keep the facilities covering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from October 1 , 2016 , citizens and industrial enterprises from cat@@ fish , curiosity , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lind@@ enberg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg have to be deeper into the w@@ allet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fee increases between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Head of directors Herbert Schmidt showed the body , a renewal of fees for the se@@ wage systems of the market base was necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the period from October 2016 until September 2020 are also identical or under@@ cover from the previous cal@@ cul@@ ation period .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with all three se@@ wage increases , the engraved fee increases by relatively small facilities with a very low se@@ wage attack , between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the low power supply system , e.g. expenses for several thousand euros would have eff@@ ected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the se@@ wage treatment plant in all three systems is slightly dec@@ lining .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , in the covered period of calculations in all three plants , no least due to their age , refurb@@ ishing and repair expenses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for the Nazis , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ u , Lind@@ enberg and L@@ opp almost 20 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Schmidt proved that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the se@@ wage plant due to a damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after almost 20 years of operation the first ten@@ si@@ di@@ ke had to be out@@ dated and in the pond pump L@@ opp , after almost 20 years of operation the first di@@ ke need to be installed and an additional ventilation possibility must be installed in order to continue in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Schmidt : &quot; for this extraordinary expenditure the continued service and maintenance costs came into account according to the new calculation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs which at the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 were still clearly below the current level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses made clear that at low se@@ wage decay in the three plants , expenditure for the operation and maintenance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this case , Schmidt continued to dev@@ ise the market base of great entertainment costs in the se@@ wage systems over the past 20 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation for the mentioned plants will continue to remain pre@@ h@@ ous , since people could not expand the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal to expand the supply area because it is concerned by expl@@ orer institutions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bulgaria posted inflation for the first time in 8 months
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nationwide statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria came 1 % in July , on a monthly basis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year has been recorded as positive 0.2 % .
the average annual inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured after the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) amounted to -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation was -@@ 0.2 % compared to July 2015 .
in July 2016 there was a price increase in the following groups of consumer goods : food and non alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell by clothes and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; Mo@@ bili@@ ar , household appliances and routine warning ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prices remained as in pre @-@ mon@@ at and alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; and education unchanged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; Eff@@ ect as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature cri@@ tici@@ zed
take Snap@@ chat says that this filter is an anim@@ e series but some ob@@ servers say that it is in@@ sensitive to races .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its filter tool , Snap@@ chat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identity in such a way that &apos;s already the absurd . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can turn into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein paintings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the filters are un@@ bo@@ unded , autonomous tools that produce more than 30 million improved sel@@ fish per day .
all mal@@ functions arrive to the public .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; snap@@ chat filters have pulled in the past criticism , in which they were accused of propag@@ ate the app Black@@ face promoted or white skin than beauty ideal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a week ago a filter suggested a filter , which gave them sli@@ pping , false teeth and dar@@ ing che@@ eks , called some critics a rac@@ ist cartoon of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow face . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they asked whether these repeated contro@@ versi@@ es refer to a bigger problem , that the company has diversity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the news and the in@@ dig@@ nation were widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat , that it had de@@ activated the feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was an homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have seen apar@@ theid had remin@@ ded the filter of vulner@@ able c@@ lich@@ és .
others refused the anim@@ e comparison decided .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace &apos;s Spar@@ ap@@ ani wrote a Korean @-@ American art student whose attempts have been widely distributed over the photos that the filter &quot; hurt and m@@ ild@@ ly was un@@ comfortable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very controversial Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that the filter has not been assured @-@ protected but that the yellow face has been pulled down .
snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses these cultural pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the american culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration fight , from conference rooms up to Hollywood and the equipment we are all in hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Snap@@ ch@@ ats Big audience young people - who are di@@ vers@@ ed in things as their older cl@@ an@@ ists - could rather come out of it , sensitivity to expect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats felt a photo , &quot; so it is much more difficult that you remain un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday Z@@ hu decided to delete the name as a product manager and engineer for media , to delete their snap@@ chat account and ur@@ ged others to do the same . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a essay on medium and in a phone interview she said that she believes that there is a lack of diversity in attitude practices with Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the big part white and only male leadership and finished their essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either I have no various representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can work with other skin colours that are working there , but they are safe or feel good to say what to say . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that has left Snap@@ chat mostly un@@ answered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company publishes no numbers for the diversity of its workforce , and points to its status as private enterprise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , we declined Snap@@ chat , to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his employees , but according to a speaker , the company recently proved to concentrate on under@@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu said that she will be locked to her Snap@@ chat account , and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military leadership distor@@ ted ISIS secret information ; represents the Congress of the Congress
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; military personnel of the United States Central Command changed the objective information to draw an optimal picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic state in Iraq and Syria , and reported an investig@@ ational committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preliminary report , created by a Task Force for rep@@ ubli@@ can members , intelligence service and military command law , reported by great dis@@ satisfaction under Central Command secret services anal@@ ysts , which changed their ass@@ ess@@ ments to the American efforts against the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Central Command , just C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; news service information , typically given by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Commander , was regularly put on site by American efforts against terrorism , and were more positive than analysis of other news services , quoted a newspaper article . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - if bad analyses of our political leaders will be presented , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , rep@@ ubli@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives , is un@@ acceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
guides in Cent@@ Com range up to the top tip of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows permanent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there is no direct indications that government sp@@ ikes to alter the reports , it shows how anal@@ ysts exposed to pressure from their laws , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many central @-@ press statements , statements and statements before the Congress were clearly more positive than the facts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com &apos;s representative announced that it had already begun to take it in April or May 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mos@@ ul , the second largest city of Iraq , remains under control of Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , it is so clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , rep@@ ubli@@ can Congress , from Kansas , in a commentary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the middle of 2014 until the middle of 2015 , the top of Central Command changed the downstream reports to watch the danger by ISIS in Iraq . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Republi@@ can calling the Task Force in life after having played , that Anal@@ ysts are worried about the manipulation of reports from the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report published on Thursday will be completed by detailed findings and will be continued during investigations .
additional investigations of the Cent@@ Com reports are also underway by the General Director of the Defense Ministry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , Democratic members of the news service published their own findings , with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com has created a over@@ ly limited process for the preparation of administrative ass@@ ess@@ ments concerning IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , member of the Represent@@ ative Adam B. Ship , in a position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this process , as Mr. Schiff , was delayed the publication of pre @-@ set reports , damaged the mor@@ ality of anal@@ ysts , and gave a little space for devi@@ ating opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Schiff and Democrats gave no clu@@ es to the eyes of the White House at Cent@@ Com Anal@@ ysts , in respect of a specific political opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigations were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last August , the New York Times was reported by the Pentagon &apos;s general insp@@ ector , which were taken after complaints of Cent@@ Com Anal@@ ysts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; l@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a press Officer , announced that the Ministry of Defence would not comment the reports of the Congress during the investigations of the General In@@ spec@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he also gave the evidence that &quot; experts sometimes have the for@@ warding opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important topics in the national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investigations have established provisions on the issue of a successful air campaign against Iraq and Syria ( an alle@@ g@@ ation , which is made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the accus@@ ations of last year abandoned the question , President Obama can rely on the Central Command for military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; criticism concerning the Islamic State of over ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ kers signed a small occupation force in Iraq , thinking about the consequences of many Anal@@ ysts , thinking about the consequences of invasion of 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ kers also played a key role in the insur@@ rection against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ kers to claim government statements against the refin@@ eries of the terrorist group , since these provisional refin@@ eries were put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this discovery was not published , the Times was reported in September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cent@@ er@@ s dam@@ al@@ ous commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was cri@@ tici@@ zed by members of the Legis@@ lative Council of his excessive positive assessment of the war situation before the Senate .
general Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the USA gains a fourth match in the Ho@@ ckey of Women &apos;s Ho@@ sts with a show@@ down with UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one day after she had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am made the first two gates for the American field team of women in a match on Thursday against India , that won the Americans with 3 @-@ 0 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; five goals in two games should actually display a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said that she could not remember that ever done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I do not belong to the people who kept their doors in memory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , they know : the American women are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are still in their group with the Brit@@ ten on the first place to remain un@@ defeated in their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last match of the first round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ final , the game will decide which the two will gain the first and second place within their group of six teams . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first placed on the road becomes a little longer from the path , which will lead the other group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as usual the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have caused a surprising chaos , four years after she reached the last London games in the past 12 places . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she grew in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a hockey stick in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became a national player in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you missed the Olympics in 2008 , as it did not qualify for the ca@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came the year 2012 where she and her team was all sl@@ ack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following year , Craig Par@@ n@@ ham became an Engl@@ ish@@ man , trainer of the National Team and thus began to turn things for better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a culture change that change and a physical change &quot; said B@@ am .
we did not have the work place in London that we have now .
we have done the ru@@ d@@ der completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the cake in the first half of the game with a blow @-@ back cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; India has gone down to the game without victory in the game , but the team showed a surprising angle of 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am the game took into their hands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they completed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and invited the ball to get a 2 @-@ 0 lead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final door in the middle of the last district .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the top of the tournament , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to book a gate in each of the previous games until now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has a run .
as well as B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on Saturday the next game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
am@@ id@@ st the R@@ age of the Olympic Games ; the Zen of the trampoline
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wherever you are , how late it is , the Olympic Games are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel consistent and inev@@ itable to the events of the Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is , as if the Olympic tor@@ ch itself would be a scor@@ ching staff , which will protect from the arm or s@@ wimm@@ ers to tri@@ athletes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you cannot listen to the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor in the queu@@ e at the queu@@ e in the Coff@@ es@@ hop without using Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the fight between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is one of the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s s@@ warm with dimples , would have absolutely been sent under these known names that would have been sent to Prime Time , when he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner or even F@@ encing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic re@@ tur@@ nes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further from the center , partly in the shadow , the sports that are not generally recognized : air nozzles , arch@@ ery , bad@@ minton , ta@@ ek@@ w@@ ondo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will always have the chest swimming and let it prevail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if I should make the arguments to my particular favourite , let me direct attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the trampoline . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the trampoline was already an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had been in Sydney when it was in Sydney , many of those who asked I did not know that it is a Olympic sport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even though the US athletes sent this competition , there has never been a medal at the trampoline until 2012 , who made it to the final round . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chinese and the Russians tend to divide the men and the Chinese and the Canadian , to share the women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; jumping on the trampoline has a certain external side char@@ me , partly because it sounds for the un@@ cleared ear for a Clow@@ n@@ s@@ school than that of the Olympic Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an educated enthusiasm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has humor@@ ously potential - the car@@ th@@ on@@ ary cit@@ tern of his never ending war@@ p , but also the gra@@ m@@ acy of the gym and dive , the two sports that are essentially joined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the word &quot; Trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline which means a lot like a spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; jump star@@ ches jump on a giant trampoline , shoot nearly up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling movements ( turning , h@@ encing and Sal@@ tos ) before they landing on the feet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are rated as an official Olympic Tier &apos; according to design , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight forward .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; med@@ alli@@ sts are forced to go into gold in their pursu@@ it of gold , even faster , even to the end , sometimes , and back , and down , and down at the playground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they ch@@ ase not only the finish line or the base , but also in the TV @-@ transmission is another destination : the world or the Olympics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the targeted course is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ ati@@ cally - and it &apos;s enough to even stir the audience to tears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is also what I felt even when looking at these games as something fati@@ gu@@ ing .
this trampoline offers an at@@ on@@ ause for this .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward motion is not the goal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he or she boun@@ ced back , seem@@ ingly wei@@ ght@@ lessly like an astr@@ on@@ aut , move upward and then effortlessly back up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also here there is a competition , of course not without difficulty but during practice , there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , only the dre@@ aming , elegant re@@ vocation of time and gravity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympic Games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the qualification and final round of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in the streaming of 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , likewise at 13.00 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ BC will beam out the final round as part of a afternoon shift from 14.00 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of the Olympia @-@ mania they promise a calm , nice moment , a that is likely to over@@ see in general tum@@ ult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the awareness of the consciousness can only be reached through fear and objec@@ ti@@ fication of male athletes , Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey is eag@@ erly awa@@ ited , new fan base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia and Long a ally of the USA
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators demand political changes in Ethiopia and calls on violent opposition leaders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witnesses say that there were dirty prot@@ esters during clas@@ hes with the police , with s@@ uss@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is Ethiopia just joined together ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid accounting with a rapidly growing economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in recent months , protests against the government sh@@ attered the country and expanded steadily over areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last week , thousands of people stor@@ med on the streets and demanded their fundamental political changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the government &apos;s response was merciful to human rights organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witnesses showed that police officers , dirty and killed by the polic@@ emen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in circulation , videos on the protests that are probably from the last or early this year , show how security professionals attract young people with sticks , while these were forced to make a hand@@ set against a wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UN Committee of Human Rights now requires a detailed study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was always difficult to stop this country and in the future it will even be more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , head of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is in Nigeria the most popul@@ ous country of Africa and its stability is greatly appreciated by the West .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; American military and secret services work closely with the Ethi@@ op@@ ians to fight terror beyond the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western aid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new P@@ end@@ ler train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if Ethiopia was anything but a role for democracy - human rights organisations have continued continuing the repression of the government - the opposition in the country was limited , where dis@@ si@@ dents were effectively put to silence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many were sent into exile , or sent to prison , or driven into the wilderness of the wilderness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and don &apos;t have any other options apart from protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Central Ethi@@ op@@ ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole youth has been prot@@ ested .
a generation has been prot@@ ested .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are numerous complaints , that cover everything from the ground @-@ use until throws in the power of the ruling coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following a widespread election last year , the ruling party and its allies have the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time ten@@ sions get along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for these z@@ fli@@ ers , disputed line called hundreds of lives in June .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the separ@@ ati@@ st fears that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front de O@@ g@@ aden , which were more or less forced into the turbul@@ ence over the last few years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ ing after years of ag@@ eing in the surface can now explo@@ de under the surface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only in the last years , many Ethi@@ op@@ ians had been able to communicate with social media , since cheaper Smartphones was more common and improved their Internet services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even when the government has access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular distances , many people still communicate via Internet Pro@@ x@@ ies to hide themselves where they are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several young Ethi@@ op@@ ians announced that they were gathered in the protests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ h@@ as , the two largest Eth@@ n@@ ics in Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ per@@ as are not any natural enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since e@@ ons prosp@@ ered the Am@@ per@@ as , that come from Eth@@ opia , in politics and economy , while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos and many Muslims live and live in shallow waters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this is also changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are co @-@ ordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest protests took place in the Am@@ per@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos in the areas of the Am@@ per@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many Am@@ per@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have dominated that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , representing approximately 6 percent of the population and the military , in the secret services , in trade and politics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the third reason for the rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , was up to his death on a non @-@ public tender in 2012 in Ethiopia prime minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was considered tac@@ tical gen@@ ius , a man who could think of corners .
Anal@@ ysts predi@@ ct that he was particularly vulner@@ able to use and to use early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use special officers to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the current regime it is missing in this basic skill , &quot; Mr Ab@@ di said , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ethiopia of new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ on Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected from relatively in@@ op@@ aque grounds to take the status of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ sts comes from the south . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
analy@@ st say that he enjoys not enjoying the trust by the tiger controlled security services .
many fear that the result will be more bloo@@ d@@ shed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such an erup@@ tion in 2005 , after thousands of elections were apparently deceived by the government and was stolen by the government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the following raid , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if it were less than in the past few months and the time of un@@ rest was relatively quick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; development experts including Ethiopia Guide to their visionary infrastructure planning , as well as the new P@@ end@@ ler &apos;s train , as well as their meas@@ ur@@ able progress in poverty ab@@ at@@ ement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but apparently this has not hin@@ dered the intensi@@ fication of the internal dis@@ g@@ ages of the Ethi@@ op@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ine city , conducted by Tig@@ ray and hatred towards the Tig@@ ray is always more common in social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
analy@@ st say that protests and other Western allies gain a pec@@ uli@@ ar position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for connecting flights over the neighboring Somalia , even if it was recently told that she closed this base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the West must clearly support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want his ally collap@@ sed in an already volati@@ le region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di &quot; said &quot; is a very thin de@@ fle@@ ction . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump declar@@ es his asser@@ tion Obama was founded on ISIS &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump attemp@@ ted to scatter the last contro@@ vers@@ y on Friday , that his multiple repeated declar@@ ations , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton would not have been serious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this clari@@ fication raises new questions about the communication capabilities of the president of the Republi@@ can , whether he is able to communicate and understand@@ able with the American public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also brings his ten@@ ders to take him to protect him during an event@@ ful phase , to explain statements , which he could not have meant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after he made the att@@ acking on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump came back in terms of the asser@@ tion on Thursday , and insi@@ sted that he really not intended to be pleased that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in an early morning Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was being sar@@ c@@ astic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as opposed to the previous day , Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews he said the accus@@ ation is perfectly serious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the conservative radio present@@ er Hu@@ gh Ho@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump intends that Mr. Obama wants to destroy him . the Republi@@ can Presi@@ dential candidate wanted nothing to know about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last storm of criticism is reduced to Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tried to ste@@ er the focus of his campaign against falling demand for economic situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held speech@@ es about economic situation in Michigan in this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return to this subject .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ tons would lead to higher taxes and that he had d@@ ull her speech d@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of July he moved up with strong criticism when he meant that Mrs. Clin@@ tons should ins@@ ist E@@ mails , but later he said , &quot; Of course I said , &quot; I said the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to shift the lingu@@ istic borders in politics , and then re@@ lie@@ ve demand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is one of his methods to test as certain messages from his fans will be absorbed , and then if necessary , Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication sex@@ ist , who observed the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think also , he is clever enough to keep his testim@@ onies enough , so that they can be interpreted in various ways . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of sharp@@ ening the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has taken an un@@ equi@@ vocal sound because its fra@@ ction have declined further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a guided tour of the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally attemp@@ ted to exc@@ use his pro@@ voc@@ ative expression , he frequently acc@@ uses his critics to de@@ file his testimony or to w@@ ron@@ g@@ ly understand his hum@@ our . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but while he stands increasingly in focus of attention in the last few months of the presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps Scher@@ ze have tried his loyal partners to stand at him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rud@@ olph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ umps &apos;s most prominent speakers , gave rise to the candidates today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; said Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani about how Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had established the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s true that Obama fought an almost unknown , small organization , he named her back@@ ben@@ chers , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he moved the troops from Iraq . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the ma@@ instream rep@@ ubli@@ can try to argue that the government served under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton as an external minist@@ ary to spread it out to spread out the situation in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media , and cast them before , to treat each of his words and to be pre@@ occupied against him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he de@@ fied the poor , &quot; poor &quot; television expert , who try to understand him and said , &quot; You can &apos;t say it ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats sp@@ aw@@ ed about Mr. Tr@@ ump exc@@ use as only one further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
once supp@@ ressed about the market price - cafe in Green@@ point returns
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; verb cafe was an ab@@ big@@ ous cafe in William@@ sburg , where you could only pay in cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years , good coffee served . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front has been supp@@ ressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the business So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , the verb in the summer of 2014 sold , sold soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
local acc@@ ru@@ ed it as the last loss in a modified city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple , on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I still couldn &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea hotel except and Ver@@ b now is a soap shop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if New York change is change then it is also new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recovered Ver@@ b Cafe last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accept credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new owner of Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new caf@@ eteria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he began working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a customer offered him a customer to deliver funds for a new external building , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rodri@@ guez ; 36 . there was a lot of things .
verb use the same distributor for the excav@@ ator bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ guez told that he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the menu , sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese and there are she@@ aths such as cap@@ ers and aci@@ ited onions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is natural re@@ lin@@ ers .
the café served no beer more so it gives fresh juices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ guez told you noticed that he noticed an accomplished power to old clients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also har@@ assed by prices from William@@ sburg &quot; he said .
recently in a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a client .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 lived before in William@@ sburg and visited the verb regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even after her Green@@ point , she would take the way up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the verb had closed , she gave the coffee t@@ ines for a while . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized that it was in the coffee and at the culture in the verb , which I liked , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they drink coffee even if they bought a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea in this day instead of their usual dishes . another new addition is .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the start of the verb in 2003 .
he went there before work and ordered inev@@ it@@ ably the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came in a quarter after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and put new ingredients in the menu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , Ros@@ enthal still get his usual order , but sometimes he alter@@ n@@ ates his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rodri@@ guez said that he had no trust that he has taken up the old business space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie &apos;s owners to produce a special soap for the coffee bre@@ wed coffee of the café as an ingredient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think we are going to comment on her offer &quot; said Rodri@@ guez .
and the traditional Polish resident Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new customer has translated the menu to Polish , and Rodri@@ guez said that he has decided to make her soon to feel his new neighbours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the site also has further advantages .
a local Saf@@ et@@ ch@@ on wants to fill the cold bre@@ wed coffee into the bottle and sell them .
there is a chance that the café expands to an adjacent building .
a new car@@ b is sufficient for many customers to get their old favor@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Joseph W@@ itt was a master builder and said that he was destroyed at the ground , when the café was closed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the new café was opened , Wh@@ itt said that the step@@ ping day of Lok@@ as and the best coffee was felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had to smell &quot; he said .
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his asc@@ en@@ sion to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took part in the O@@ val Office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as g@@ our@@ mets President Roosevelt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined Del@@ ic@@ ate eating at Fifth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ia gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on this day was a bit modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and dessert a l@@ ur@@ p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering men , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ cht@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both of the food historian .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ it &apos;s last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; worked from the Chinese cuisine in the US , during brick in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential building near the Lower East Side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; will be published on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrated the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with repor@@ ter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sandwich Shop for dinner together with a small theat@@ rical I@@ mb@@ iss in the Fla@@ ti@@ ron District that has been in the store since the IP@@ O in 1929 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brick , 54 , ordered a fresh sauce with olive trees , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed and a vegetable mixture ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the Rep@@ orter ordered chi@@ pped , this couple appeared for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular &quot; said Bo@@ ck@@ man .
there were pean@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and somewhat cheaper in the ingredient .
imagine so many pean@@ uts have to eat that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has to be put in the stomach like lead , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
teams of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked past@@ ete for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans , who sent an hung@@ red Europeans during the first world war , with which the country went over , no longer the Cock@@ a@@ ig@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when eating was a central , held topic in Essen , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as ten@@ se was the new bud@@ get@@ te : mysterious foods such as loaves and c@@ asser@@ tions were re@@ un@@ confident about stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es were re@@ un@@ confident , as coo@@ ks un@@ appe@@ tiz@@ ers could hide in@@ appe@@ tiz@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried ob@@ ols .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meat , which was the focal point of the American kitchen for years , became a rare ser@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pec@@ uli@@ ar compounds have been tried since a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nour@@ ishing accus@@ ation had priority from taste or even healthy food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during her research for the book , which includes also recipes , prepared a dish from this epoch , fried onions with pean@@ ut butter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was no more popular addition at lunch &quot; says Co@@ e .
Zi@@ eg@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pean@@ ut butter and baked onions are not fit one another .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as never before or ever since , Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 @-@ 1943 - the country &apos;s eating habits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by having recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encourage women to become com@@ min@@ ate and to transform P@@ amp@@ e sp@@ aghetti with carrots in delicious meals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a feast of historical treats .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially tasty are the reports about the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ food post@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he comm@@ ended the simple I@@ owa peas@@ ant kitchen in his kitchen , he sp@@ iced as the one million@@ th man from the world to which he became . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he liked Continental food like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ ce &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in a g@@ ild@@ ed dining room and wore a Smo@@ king .
he was a mar@@ vel@@ ous reality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps President Roosevelt would have made the same mistake , if not his wife had asked him to stat@@ u@@ stom@@ ed with his stomach a sign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as described in the book , the Anglo @-@ workers &quot; house@@ keeper introduced with no interest in flavors that the White House brought the bored food in Washington but also one of the most boring food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , with food , was rejected as soon as the country came back to his legs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , she said , and as science was applied to food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the couple were able to better understand the eating habits of brick @-@ law mother in law , for example how they could not throw food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear in the waste of food . &quot; said Co@@ e .
Zi@@ eg@@ man remembered : &quot; she actually made people sick . &quot;
there was the attack of the wind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the plate was cleared by Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they moved and Co@@ e made a des@@ serts that they had prepared home : the pr@@ enti@@ ce would eat Roosevelt for lunch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said zi@@ lev@@ man and added that it was a usual trick that was a modest trick to miss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no proposed cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
everyone di@@ ps slightly lu@@ ct@@ antly a spo@@ ons in the chew@@ ing , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly it was not bad .
Co@@ E won three times a night@@ fall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ get@@ er , he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bombs : he was the hero of Aleppo
he sat down his own life to help others : Khaled Omar .
he was the hero of Aleppo : Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died in a bom@@ ber attack of the Assad regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Omar was a member of the &quot; White helmet , &quot; a civil protection group , which has so far heard about 60,000 people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
29@@ 00 Volun@@ te@@ ers put their lives in the game to attract people from bom@@ bed houses and make first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civil guard that shows him in a 11 hour rescue from a house , and he went around the world in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it made the Syrian symbolic symbol in the grey of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as heroes , he never seen himself , according to the picture : &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die to save lives , I think God sees in me a marty@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly before Omar himself fell victim to a victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the helicop@@ ters have dropped four sti@@ cky bombs across the Alzheimer &apos;s district . it was filled with chlorine gas .
one woman and two children died ; seven people suffer from breathing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now eliminate the po@@ ison@@ ous remains of the bomb , so that not children play it , &quot; quoted the image of his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terr@@ orists .
Greenland @-@ shar@@ k : the oldest cycl@@ ist is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea after an examination on board of S@@ anna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats across the North Atlantic Ocean , reaching a distance of 1 km / h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Greenland has only got 150 years of offspring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the ground of Greenland , Greenland has been flo@@ cked down to the North Atlantic Ocean at an average of just 1.@@ 220 meters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only when it matters , the five meter @-@ long animal accelerates to a maximum of 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this long @-@ shaped lifestyle seems to be a god@@ child for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report at the &quot; Science &quot; journal anyway by a Greenland @-@ shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; ma@@ dness &quot; commented by Alexander Sch@@ mitt@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock this way of life that means a world record for verteb@@ rates .
in fact the Evol@@ ution@@ ary bi@@ ologist already pres@@ umed that Greenland will become st@@ ony .
only lack@@ ed the evidence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Greenland &apos;s ha@@ ie are hard to observe , but they mainly live in the polar sea before the thin sealed co@@ asts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they prefer water @-@ temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they appear in the surface mostly only in winter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers know that researchers know a little bit about the lifestyle of Greenland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their time sna@@ kes it , when they spread six animals with one transmitter against S@@ val@@ bard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , these shar@@ ks put prey : in the stomach of a animal , researchers found the remains of a seal ; another one had swal@@ lowed the pine trees of a young polar bear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you may hunt them sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of ice cream and seek Kad@@ aver , those from higher water layers down@@ wards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie : the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 were sailing from Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as con@@ cat@@ cher from the North Atlantic ocean .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cen@@ tim@@ eters long while the largest shar@@ k tim@@ eters in size was just 81 cen@@ tim@@ eters long .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to determine the age of animals , they analysed the Lin@@ ear core of the Ha@@ ie with the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this centre of the eye lens is already being built before the birth of the shar@@ ks which contained proteins later is no longer renewed .
the two smaller shar@@ ks had a striking carbon @-@ 14 in the len@@ tic@@ ular core .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons are looking for higher quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 220 cen@@ tim@@ eters in length the lens core contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from nuclear weapon , it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in its linear core , all bigger Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities that creates through cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock for a 4@@ 93 cm @-@ long Greenland @-@ shar@@ k showed a age of 335 years , while the record shar@@ k with 502 cen@@ tim@@ eters may be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Greenland @-@ hai @-@ females get offspring until they &apos;re longer than four metres , then became known . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the researchers were able to assign an old age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 cen@@ tim@@ eters were probably on the threshold of sex mature , and his age was determined at 156 years , Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie has obviously taken at least one and a half centuries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also might be a world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such methane al@@ on@@ emes live mainly in icy waters is no co@@ incidence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the old record holder , a 211 @-@ year @-@ old Greenland , inserted a 120 @-@ year old Har@@ po@@ on tip , was caught in front of Alaska . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of living there live on spar@@ ks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they gra@@ sp@@ ing later - and al@@ it@@ ating slower .
in order to keep warm in cold water the animals are often particularly large .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the volume grows much faster than its surface , comple@@ mented by the animal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram elephant .
another advantage : they have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives at risk and should focus on it as soon as possible as many offspring as soon as possible . &quot; explains the evolution of evolution .
a very big animal should rather invest his resources in a long life .
building in double pack
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with topics around building , the council has focused mainly on the latest meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the panel increased the communication by Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally the marketing of more previously designated residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the site of the site , par@@ cel@@ ing and Resol@@ utions were clari@@ fied and the applications for surve@@ ying could be placed in the residential areas of &quot; Road of road &quot; and &quot; Schö@@ na@@ u @-@ West &quot; ( section 1 ) for interested parties nothing more in the way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the council is convinced that the bli@@ sters embossed in the rustic and peaceful living congregation of Schö@@ na@@ u young families , and ha@@ un@@ ing sen@@ iors alike . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was called , construc@@ tional content can be reported immediately in the Town Hall , on the awar@@ ding of the plots is expected to advise the Municipal Council in its September meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to encourage inquiries to the res@@ ett@@ lement of other commercial enterprises , the council decided to change new land use plan in the spring of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way the commercial area has already been expanded by two plots in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg , the city of Frankfurt passed the best opportunities to attract jobs and companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is likely that Frankfurt benefits from the Bre@@ xit &quot; vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ ington , Head of Comp@@ et@@ ence Markets and Real Estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is unlikely that cash stores are allowed to operate from London &apos;s financial transactions throughout the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the so @-@ called EU @-@ Pass it goes before the admission to Britain .
this only use large US banks .
several banks have already announced to store jobs .
the Lob@@ by@@ ist &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; anticip@@ ates a 10000 jobs job in the Main for five years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Frankfurt , so the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , united the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro zone , as well as the European insurance policy E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk factor ES@@ R@@ B . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris , the organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) have its headquarters , but it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the emer@@ gen@@ bank is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ ington . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg dispos@@ es of a major fund industry as well as Dublin in its infrastructure as well as Dublin .
Frankfurt is clearly easier to reach thanks to the big airport .
the city besides easily available commercial real estate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris , it isn &apos;t that simple to find free high quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ ington . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Seine is also the rental for first @-@ class commercial property by 50 percent higher than on the Main .
furthermore Frankfurt offer higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ranking of corporate consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city stood on No.@@ 7 , Luxembourg , No.@@ 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if life of life is a question of pre@@ ferences : &quot; with its already strong position as a finance location for the European domestic market , Frankfurt could tigh@@ ten further banks and investors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite the Bre@@ xit vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also supports the relationship of forces : in London , according to numbers from Landesbank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 , some 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking sector in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the case of the law@@ suit on Thursday , Bet@@ h Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead has claims that he has formed during the defence of the F@@ alles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mer@@ ck attempts with Gilead , domin@@ ating the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medications that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver illness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck joined each other , and his property on laboratory work took the active ingredient in the drug of Gilead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the US backed troops say that they have recovered complete control over Man@@ bi@@ j from Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Clin@@ tons deser@@ ve EUR 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.@@ 2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton published its tax statement for 2015 published for the presidential election of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.@@ 2 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , Clin@@ tons issued USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , primarily to the Clinton Foundation ; the former President Bill Clinton issued a salary of USD 3 million from Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster by Verlag Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clin@@ tons candidate for Vice @-@ President , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton his tax returns of the past ten years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a sharp contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump does hiding behind false expressions and rep@@ ut@@ ors with regard to its previous consultations on their tax returns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is custom@@ ary to publish their tax returns to US presidential candidates , although they are not obliged by law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated a tax test as a reason for ref@@ using the tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they are on the train &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the train &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Twitter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Twitter , with regards to the publication of the presidential election of the Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ ump special counsel , to CN@@ N , that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to release something before tax checks are not finished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump critic among others , among others , the Republi@@ can Presi@@ dential candidate of 2012 ranks among wealth , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business and other organisations , especially with Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton had already made a video on the subject and on Friday , a video on the Internet published in the high @-@ level Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump to publish its tax returns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday she spoke about the topic even during a speech to the economy in Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refused to do what every other candidate has been doing in recent decades , and to publish his tax returns . &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Tr@@ ump has paid no or less taxes during the 1990s , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ers that could still be the case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton supports a rule that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , that would make people more than USD 1 million to pay a tax rate of at least 30 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in the past week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ra@@ ska called buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ ek@@ glomer@@ ate had his headquarters to discuss their tax returns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; buff@@ ets said that he had been subjected to a control test of the IRS and dump &quot; fear , &quot; fears and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons campaign has left tax returns to date back to 2007 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Clin@@ tons , which now lives in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , has an average of 32 % effective federal tax rate between 2007 and 2014 , and an effective combined tax rate of about 40@@ ,5 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tax statement of the Clin@@ tons of 2015 showed that these only USD 100 of their income in their income , unlike the majority of all Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their primary funding was a cheaper In@@ dex@@ fund , from which the Clin@@ tons divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

con@@ doms with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der , fireworks promote Tanz@@ anian elephant protection
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nature protected in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to hold eleph@@ ants away from it , in people inhabited sett@@ lements , they throw con@@ doms to them that are filled with chili powder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the method has proved effective as an effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which trained its funding in the north of Tanz@@ anian , to use a violent four @-@ stage approach to protect their homes and crops without causing animals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before we used a lot of sp@@ ear to defend themselves .
Friday is world call day dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ever since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we could have seen a change in setting of their fields , without damage the eleph@@ ants in it . &quot; says the director of Hon@@ ey@@ moon Damian Bell in a notice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first two steps include the light of the elephant with a tor@@ ch , and the bubbles in a horn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when it is not deter@@ red you will be called &apos; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &apos; .
cip@@ her powder mixed with earth is packaged together with fireworks in a con@@ dom with its end to the ignition switch only .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it is kind@@ led , the con@@ dom comes with a b@@ ang and spra@@ yed fine dust to Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der into the air . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a touch quite usually already in order to ch@@ ase the elephant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one last option is a ver@@ fer , who sho@@ ots a golf course in the air and caused a loud , light explosion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
city council unanim@@ ously agreed : no ki@@ os@@ por@@ ridge at St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normally , the St. Go@@ ar@@ er investment plans of industrial companies with K@@ us@@ sh@@ and is still regarded as far as retail in the downtown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Rh@@ u@@ fer &apos;s proposal on the Rhine river banks in the immediate vicinity of the City Council , but now one accord with one accord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically we welcome new Commercial , but at this location in a exposed location on the Rhine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath , for the CDU faction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Jewish director , Berlin hotel defe@@ ats Berlin hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; dri@@ fting - RT News &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a French director with Jewish roots unle@@ ashed a media pipe after he had betra@@ yed the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin , since it had claimed Arabic guests according to a staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentation &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; made his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay Lanz@@ mann Israel tried to find Israel on the country pre@@ ferences list of the hotel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the country was not listed in the countries that can be accessed directly from the hotel room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel eliminated and deleted them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
written Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a possibility to select Israel via an own call center . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after one explanation the director was looking to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the answer that he received there , &quot; threw him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel had said that the measure was a clear decision of the &quot; Kemp@@ inski Hotel &quot; management .
the reason behind it stood in the director even more rage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have requested that the pre @-@ election is deleted , the candidate of Lanz@@ mann has been cited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das merchant called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; says the South German newspaper .
we were dis@@ armed and over@@ thrown by this event .
it is really very embar@@ rass@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain , is even greater shame . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no explanation requires this .
we expect that the hotel &quot; says the right conclusions : &quot; the ministers said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident set a rather big resonance on the Internet , where people sc@@ anned the whole sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some sub@@ ordin@@ ated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that would have given it to the supposed current Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed of , &quot; it was stated in another post that the hotel is located in the clas@@ sy Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly denied all accus@@ ations from each and called the incident a &quot; failure &quot; and &quot; ap@@ olog@@ ised &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , explains the mirror . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; Israel didn &apos;t record in the fast dial list , &quot; the southern German newspaper made a speaker of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds : the country code now has been added .
police makes tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo , students joined the police in Sao Paulo in order to demonstrate the government &apos;s reforms for the public educational system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police put Tr@@ än@@ n@@ as and rubber bul@@ let against the prot@@ esters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the difficulties started , as police officers tried to tackle the students , which resulted in the police bul@@ let down and tear gas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation over plans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to proposals by the Government of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300,000 students have been wag@@ ered to save money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Protest@@ ants see Gra@@ ff@@ iti@@ ts on the preliminary President Michel T@@ emer on walls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recent protests did a few days after demonstr@@ ators went in masses onto the streets to support the sus@@ pen@@ alties of Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , which has been reli@@ eved from the duties by a vote of the Senate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trade between Russia &amp; Iran rises to 71 % , RT Business &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the aboli@@ tion of sanctions in Iran , Lev@@ in D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade rate between Moscow and Teh@@ ran increased by 7@@ 0,@@ 9 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the international sanctions against Iran have been abol@@ ished , interest in Russian companies grew strongly in the country , shared with amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian companies take existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to get access to the market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the further commercial building is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he noted that the trade rate between Russia and Iran increased by 7@@ 0,@@ 9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared with the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the trade break was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons . &quot; the ambassador said .
D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes out of a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the Russian foreign nationals commissioned some 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , Iranian citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries , affecting the tourist number in Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that records of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , only few Russians visit Iran , something from whom the ambassador hopes that it will change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d to receive the monuments of the old Persian civilization in good condition . &quot; he said .

the joy@@ ous group was at the se@@ clu@@ ded freedom of the first school holiday week during the first week of school holidays .
several full day trips stood on the program .
for one we went to board with the visit to the mat@@ z@@ oos .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other way back to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special child leadership in the world famous con@@ vent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the third trip led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ Museum in Hoch@@ dorf the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the hot days the group enjoyed swimming in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited to the jumping , swimming and plan@@ tations invited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; culinary We have spoiled children and car@@ ers with their self @-@ prepared cor@@ ps like the Sau@@ ger Sp@@ ear , the Se@@ eb@@ ron@@ ner path , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in workshops , beautiful jewellery made of pearls and stones were created or made of wood a Roman @-@ mill @-@ game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
further highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond that evenings the evenings by the fire and the final &quot; Color@@ ful evening . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the day of travel , the sun and the children and young people returned home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : Pil@@ gri@@ mage to the gate of Mer@@ cy
the immigrants from the pastoral care unit Ey@@ eb@@ valley @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ ole St. Anna were on the way to a four @-@ day pilgrimage of Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
together four stages were handled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to bridge over the time until the next Rom@@ wall@@ ets of all ministers in late summer , the prime minister of St. Anna decided to prepare and conduct a long @-@ day drift migration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several pilgrimage objectives have been tested and one finally decided to celebrate the Bishop of Mer@@ cy , in this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy on the Freiburg &apos;s Mu@@ cy a special pilgrimage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
16 Min@@ is from Bitt@@ or@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt are on the way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the evening , pastor of Stor@@ k sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrimage and shared the pilgrimage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Hor@@ b was driven by train to the starting point of Vill@@ ingen , where a Mu@@ enster dear wife is standing and so the pilgrimage route was driven away from Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening , by a short impulse of different prayers , songs and lab@@ elled tex@@ tures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also on the way the Min@@ is started to sing together , chap@@ els or churches to sing together again to sing together a song from specially produced pilgrims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the local par@@ ishes stood at the local par@@ ishes for the nights .
at the stage finishing Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Heidi F@@ aller for a tasty as well as strengthened dinner and breakfast .
on the second day we went on Fur@@ tw@@ angen in Gu@@ ten@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tags for the journey to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting journey , had to be lowered about 500 metres high and afterwards had to be discovered again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deser@@ ved reward was a common gr@@ illing on bathing in the evening .
after dawn on the 4th pilgrimage day in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter it went on the closing side to Freiburg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the Min@@ is met on Freiburg &apos;s later afternoon and passes the gate of mercy on the later afternoon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
God has promised here with a little impulse .
at the evening show in Münster the Min@@ is was welcomed by Ko@@ operator Markus O@@ bert .
after the divine service the pilgri@@ m were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the following day was time for the Bre@@ is@@ gau@@ metrop@@ ole .
in the afternoon it went back to Hor@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end , all participants were embar@@ rass@@ ed that the days of spiritu@@ ality and a strong community experience were marked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um S@@ kin@@ ner stor@@ med home as Br@@ ite Gold for cycling
Scottish Call@@ um S@@ kin@@ ner ra@@ ced last night in a male team @-@ Sprint at the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to glory when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the An@@ chor@@ age , his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y took the legend when he fled home to home a victory of the favor@@ ites of New Zealand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
England won a sho@@ cking victory four years ago and Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic medals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they repeated the trick , after starting in March during the championship world championships in London despite the resignation Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the issue between Beijing and London was the replacement of the passenger car Jamie Staff .
they did this time in time as someone first appeared .
Ho@@ ys retirement produced a gap to close the Ki@@ an enam@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ kin@@ ner was the man , where they remained , when they saw potential in the sh@@ all@@ ots that has now un@@ folded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y triumph@@ ed - and S@@ kin@@ ner put a Olympic record in the qualifying lap , but won the New Ze@@ al@@ anders in the first round . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the British Trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ des was close to his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and S@@ kin@@ ner kept it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a strategy of strategy made a great part of transformation which came down in a higher ais@@ le to slow down and allow Kenn@@ y and especially S@@ kin@@ ner to maintain the pace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ y looked from his position as a BBC expert and fell on S@@ kin@@ ner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when these were on the podium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 23 year old S@@ kin@@ ner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and to make a name for me .
in the final round we put up a Olympic record and conquered the world champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the triumph of 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , there was no execution following a weak start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he returned this statement later and there was no ob@@ jection of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
there was no such problem at such an outstanding victory this time .
Hin@@ des said : &quot; it feels complete with all the GB flags on the Arc de London . &quot;
we came together in the last three months as a team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with so many world titles we came away so badly , that it was incredible again to win the Olympics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this is a barometer of our progress in the past five months , we expect successful five days in Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of possible that he repeated three Olympic gold medals in a competition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be born for Kenn@@ y - exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who also was born on 23 March ( a very holy date for the British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) and a silver medal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the property of Ho@@ y is equal .
Kenn@@ y is taking part in the Sprint as the next one starts today and will go over for three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something lon@@ ely on to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; If he wins two gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ alli@@ on competition of the day but there were some good news for England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Bra@@ sh W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest capacity in the four @-@ four @-@ kilometre race . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 at the end .
the world record which won gold in London in 2012 was at 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 6@@ 59 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place today on the second day of competition , where the W@@ ig@@ gins stand up with safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday , he had fought against the qualification before the qualification , as officials caused him to measure his height . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the corresponding Women &apos;s Competition , which will continue and finished , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Barker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie at the World Record Period in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the GB team will be on his strong track team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a pe@@ ar to get medals .
after a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were driven down .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were Dra@@ mas in the background , as the withdrawal of the technical guide Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the middle of S@@ agra@@ ph@@ - and Mob@@ b@@ ing@@ ers , and the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , when one sees the first evening of the competition in Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like that now legendary reputation of GB@@ S that has reached its climax could be repeated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Future of melt by Portland due to the lifting of energy agreement
the future of aluminium sh@@ mel@@ ts from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - standing on the game since the system operators shall announce the energy supply contract and thus ensuring all the supply contracts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsi@@ dies to run the plant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a maximinum payout of 20 years has gone out in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Santa Cruz in Portland stand on the game .
not less than 2000 jobs -@@ direct and indirect - could be endangered with a closure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it could come to Domin@@ o effects , as the melt is consumed around 10 per cent of the whole power generation Vict@@ ori@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry melting , which led the last year to a closure of the old@@ town . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sm@@ iles from Al@@ coa in Portland loses money and risks a closure .
this step follows the years of long spec@@ ulation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and la@@ stly due to the current price of the plant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L , which supplied the large aluminum foil with his lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , par@@ ted that three further owners can announce their contracts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the facility is in the majority owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , which occupy the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ en@@ i Cor@@ p smaller shares . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland , which means a further physical demand for current through melting the melt means &quot; shared the company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the treaties would be called &quot; securing transactions , &quot; which would have come into force from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month period of notice to end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L expects that the contracts will contribute to the income in the business year 17 , &quot; said the power supply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on revenues at AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong fut@@ ures markets for major commercial electricity prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L shared the value of the contracts with the value of $ 187 million , amounting to a cancellation of $ 187 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa , that the decision to exp@@ ose the Tre@@ aties .... to operate the &quot; ability to operate &quot; and ensure the power supply to melt &quot; not inter@@ f@@ ere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US company said that there was a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , which would have entered into force in 2010 , even if it is still a statement , why it has re@@ signed from the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the poor economic conditions of the branch in front of the possible closing ceremony at the Portland , Victoria and the Tom@@ ago complex near Newcastle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in reference to the analy@@ st &apos;s statements on the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mic@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland will generate approximately 900 meg@@ a@@ watts and more than 900 meg@@ a@@ watts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should both facilities disappear from the market it would mean a significant decrease in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generator , this would not be good , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Car@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality TV @-@ Star , B@@ one is on the cover of the September issue of Vog@@ ue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Kendall , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of Man@@ ag@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner C@@ lans , is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the U.S. Vog@@ ue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a B@@ ee Lau@@ der &apos;s brand ambassador , and at Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on its Inst@@ agram account on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people who love , I brought me the sight of this Co@@ vers to cry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the revelation of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Car@@ das@@ hi@@ an ) as well as in the presence of the most popular Show@@ biz and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in presence of the most popular Show@@ biz @-@ On@@ k@@ els and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) : you will have all a surprise @-@ art@@ y planned .
that puts the cl@@ an act virtually every birthday episode of a children &apos;s programme ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence when you think we had forgotten you ? ) but Kris needed to take part in the public@@ ity for her other girl somehow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to the new issue of Vog@@ ue , the new era of Car@@ das@@ hi@@ es started with safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kend@@ ra big sister Kim likes her as regards the Vog@@ ue @-@ Cover , ( she and her husband Kan@@ ye West were seeing it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the new edition of the magazine is a League for itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the September issue is for Vog@@ ue the most sold @-@ packed edition of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a circum@@ ference that re@@ sembles a picture volume as a fashion label , the issue draws a large number of advertising items ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista in the 8@@ 32 pages of the built @-@ in bearing capacity 6@@ 15 pages of advertising ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unveil@@ ing of his Co@@ ver@@ stars will be so lon@@ ging that in the last two years images of the magazine is still se@@ ep@@ ed before the official announcement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women who were already on the cover , include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , the model@@ ed &quot; as &quot; models , the star@@ dom are &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oscar lau@@ re@@ ate and a Di@@ or brand ambassador , Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but even with the little chance that Mrs Jen@@ ner , described by the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls under the former category , it is in good company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or te@@ ens from today who know how to make a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything is applied to here@@ tics ) .
they are really talented women who distinguish themselves in the entertainment industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once published on the last cover , Be@@ y@@ once published one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like success to everybody .
with her reality TV history J@@ enn@@ ers was always something similar in the fashion world .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephanie Sey@@ m@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleagues hit Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called her &quot; the Mist@@ akes of the Moment . &quot;
these feelings again cooked up again when the message came out with the show J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vog@@ ue Cover .
but to flow on the Mis@@ sm@@ uth seems to go by the point .
a Her@@ ner is based on the cover of the September issue of Vog@@ ue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she is running for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer from Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
she and all her sisters sell you pictures of their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she was sold by her trained pictures from C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine qu@@ ilt .
and in her leisure time she is seen in the reality TV . presumably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
municipal centers point to 160@@ .000 people each year
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 160@@ ,000 of the aid of the country are lost annually by the municipal centers , while the industry set on the effects of other mid @-@ cuts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land , three of five people - mostly older persons , immig@@ rant , ne@@ edy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ fair del@@ etion and legal advice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
legal services of the municipality , which are already re@@ strained and are ready for further cuts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from June next year , Germany plans to lose another 30 percent of their funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Director of the Municipal Council of Que@@ ens@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Council was discovered that thousands of people have been rejected each year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation would only be worse without a repe@@ al of the decision of the Federal Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land Shar@@ ed centres are chron@@ ically under@@ estimated that thousands of people are of important service which you need to be rejected , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who leave for@@ ci@@ bly relations , people with un@@ man@@ a@@ geable and ex@@ pressing debts , workers who were dis@@ missed by separ@@ ations , workers who have un@@ fair way and this survey shows that they cannot get the help you need . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from June 2017 , the Federal Government will be forced to reduce its funds by 30 percent , which means that thousands of helpful people from Que@@ ens@@ land are forced to respond with their legal problems without any help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we demand the Federal Prosecutor and the Federal Minister of Friends , and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to respond to these Central cuts immediately so that people need help to obtain legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the state government met its commitment to raise funds to national average . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is now at the time to look at the needs of the municipal centers and their customers general , and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k will invest in this important work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump campaign was accused of having been working on a weapon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new York : Donald Tr@@ ump campaign was charged with alleged perpet@@ ual crimes , having provided her campaign head for North Carolina in f@@ ebru@@ ary , a fire@@ arms on a staff while they were travelling in a je@@ ep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident is described in an indictment , which was submitted on Wednesday in the state Court of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i announced to have waited for months , that the matter would be regulated internally before he realized that &quot; it would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the struggle leader , Earl Philip , &quot; drew a gun , put his right foref@@ inger on the de@@ duction , and gave the course to his arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Berlin / Schwerin : survey of countries for the SPD and the CDU
during the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) considerable losses for the government of the SPD and the CDU continue .
this resulted in representative p@@ olls of opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Picture &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition in the north still barely ra@@ ining , this is not possible after the survey in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party and thus had good opportunities to keep the government of government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern the SPD dropped from 3@@ 5.6 percent to 24 percent over five years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the survey , the party needs only just outside the CDU that could return to 23 per cent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the third place is cont@@ ested between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Left calls come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would represent 19 percent for the first time in the Diet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gre@@ ens boun@@ ces despite easier losses of 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) again into the s@@ words of Parliament .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not represent 3 percent of the day before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the German Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties , the SPD in the survey was only 23 percent ( 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CDU reached only 18 percent to 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are still lag@@ ging behind the Green with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but on the left , with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Af@@ D would be represented at the Chamber of Represent@@ atives with 14 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope to return the pirates would miss the move in contrast to 2011 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in Time : the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market 20 years ago .
today the success@@ ors domin@@ ate the world - his manufacturer experienced a disaster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the device weigh@@ ed nearly half a kilogra@@ m , and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was th@@ icker and bigger and it was therefore not good in your hand .
on the contrary , it was pretty big .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ abytes , that would be enough for about two self @-@ resolution today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gig@@ abytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; came exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a few euros lovers can still buy the devices on the internet , but they are somehow from the Stone Age of the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
20 years ago the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had previously announced the product a few months earlier at the C@@ eb@@ it computer trade fair in Hanover as &quot; Büro in the West Germany . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent to number : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even via fax it was communic@@ ator to achieve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even access to web pages was possible via HTML @-@ browser if snow is also slowly available .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the price was rather proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , which is about 1400 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the average price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could see in August 1996 that communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
everything has been different since then .
the smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
the mobile teleph@@ ony of the Finn@@ s experienced a very un@@ pi@@ ous disin@@ teg@@ ration and was finally sold to Microsoft .
we know the market today and so much later came as Nokia .
ever and everywhere online this is today for a lot of people daily life .
in 2015 there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sold around 1.4 billion devices , Samsung and Apple were sold alone , with 5@@ 55 million units . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worldwide sales of the equipment is around 400 billion euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are the well @-@ running business of the countless App providers and the telecommunic@@ ations concert .
all around the smartphone has now evolved into a whole industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crucial breakthrough on the mass market was only at the beginning of 2007 , then Apple CEO Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World to introduce the i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he spoke three units in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communications , easy to use with touch screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the winning project from Apple began , and today the iPhone is the main product of the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nokia , We have Motorola and Black@@ berry who dominated the market .
she finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
we now have Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung .
the Smartphone is a self @-@ intel@@ li@@ gi@@ bility for 20 years after his invention .
on average each German Germans are now looking 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must all learn to go on your smartphone even now , &quot; said Jan@@ ina sphere , and in the Siemens executive board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet permanent availability is regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time .
England has to ste@@ er the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ ath@@ row will not only bring to local communities and in London , but throughout the country , renew@@ ing and prosperity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , it was the largest attraction in London , as well as in 2012 in London when we benefited a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions were benef@@ itted from the games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we will accomplish this again , by creating new opportunities for local and companies close to He@@ ath@@ row . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities alone , we will create 10,000 new trainees , 40,000 new jobs and prepare for youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , it will be such that the challenge of the extension He@@ ath@@ row is too large . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said that England will never be ready for the games , and that we will bl@@ am@@ end ourselves on stage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the branches were inj@@ us@@ tice in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to over@@ ride but He@@ ath@@ row answered every question asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual infrastructure projects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expansion is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 211 bn to swe@@ ating growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both in the whole of the UK . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have chosen a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , that a £ 11 bn expensive infrastructure system was chosen from the T@@ 5 - five years as a result of the world &apos;s largest airport terminal , which was built in the midst of the two frequency terminal blocks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they are ready to deliver a third running , which is supported by £ 16 billion at private investments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the extension of He@@ ath@@ row will be one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time that we will expand this Olympic spirit and will expand our future trading and create a legacy of skills and jobs , which can be proud of . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; regarding ad @-@ blocking
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to make money , a &quot; cat@@ ch@@ - and mouse button &quot; will be equal , according to one of the software manufacturers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook would block the ad block@@ ings on his desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus released their filters to update their filters in the program to block through advertising on the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook share that his desktop page would change the encoding regarding its advertising view to make it difficult to recognize , which part of the advertising site is difficult to make . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Ad@@ block reported that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a blog@@ post wrote the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams that &quot; this type H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her @-@ fight between the show @-@ lock@@ able Open Source community and the ren@@ ders already exists since the invention of display gri@@ pping in progress , and that Facebook is soon coming to a new solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media has left its struggle for social media , is a strong indication of wor@@ r@@ ying and wor@@ r@@ ying for the industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ as@@ air and Adobe 200 million people , currently use an ad lu@@ cra@@ cker , almost four times so much in 2013 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users who access Facebook over their mobile devices , mobile advertising cover 84 percent of the advertising revenue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides , the company has no effect on desktop PCs besides , since mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Fac@@ ebooks mobile app for social network and Inst@@ agram . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advertising on your desktop computers makes a sufficient amount of income from , so Facebook will be the investment of such a step as worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook share that it would be his &quot; advertising award &quot; tool to update the people more control over them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that stocks would be wor@@ r@@ ying on new filters , because they would also block content on the site that no adver@@ ts are needed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the user this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem by giving a speaker by Facebook in an e @-@ mail notification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bl@@ unt block , which is why we have focused on developing tools like Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
woman believes on Swiss motorway with alleged suicide
the victim was in the middle of the night on the fre@@ eway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police calls witnesses , after a woman in the early hours of the morning on Thursday at a alleged suicide of several cars crossed on a highway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident occurred at the A1 , near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one woman came in the dark &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; on the streets and were taken over by several cars , the police said in Wa@@ adt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49 years , involving more vehicles , including a truck , was forced to kill themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she died still on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several drivers have been heard already , but some still have not been identified , the police , who claim these as well as every witness of the incident to sign up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation process was opened , which is a logical step in such a situation , the G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter shared the Le Tribun@@ e de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it remains however if one of the drivers will be shown .
was a coll@@ ision avo@@ id@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is something that has to decide the pro@@ secutor , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the past five years show that the drivers are not pulled to responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in each of the two cases , one person in the dark on the highway was decided that drivers have not to go out in the middle of the night , as it was called in the newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acquitted of neg@@ ligence after having a man over@@ ride and killed , who lay at the A1 in August 2014 close by Pay@@ erne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim was drunk , and has become un@@ conscious on the road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court manifest@@ ed that the polic@@ ew@@ oman -- which had responded to an emergency call -- on a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the road was quite unusual and un@@ predic@@ table situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who has further information on the incident at the border of Morges , should register with the police at number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
NASA climate model : Venus once was hab@@ itable
the Venus was probably hab@@ itable according to the projec@@ tions of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies in NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms to re@@ semble from climate research .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the model has been designed to determine whether the Venus could have referred with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ ant atmosphere and slowly revol@@ ved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the planet probably pointed out more dry areas than Earth , but had once enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to cover life and protected from rapid evap@@ oration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow revers@@ al of Venus will exp@@ on@@ ates her face of the sun for almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds to sh@@ ielding the surface of a large number of sun war@@ ms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the results are average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than the world today .
the model brought forth a history of the Venus that re@@ sembles evolution that had been realised by Plan@@ en@@ researchers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it was probably hab@@ itable , the Venus -- in the course of more than billions years -- too much heat and ultra@@ violet light was exposed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their oceans evap@@ or@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burned down by ultra @-@ violet light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as its hydro@@ gen@@ wich , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained behind carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know them today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus Klim@@ am@@ od@@ els in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy racing as a coach of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back as a trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to a low participation in the decision of the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively the president / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision , and noted that the association will be looking immediately after a new coach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as Chief Executive Officer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey operations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determin@@ at@@ eness , &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been thinking about how long and much about it , as I could improve this team to give him more depth to bring it to higher level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey operations must be tailored perfectly to the organization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must also have a co @-@ determination in decisions which influence the performance of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are not at the moment met .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sak@@ ic , who hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , than@@ ked him for his contributions to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Patrick kept me informed today about this decision &quot; said Sak@@ ic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all appreciate what he did for our organization and wish him only the best for the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during his debut season 2013 @-@ 14 , Roy was awarded as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards as the Best Trainer of the League . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he led the club on 112 points , and in the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnes@@ ota and missed the late season in each of the last two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Aval@@ an@@ ches marked a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the season 2015 @-@ 16 and fell behind the Wild for a second wild , spot in the Western Conference by five points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy four Stanley C@@ ups - two pieces with the Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nor@@ di@@ ee@@ pers take discussions again and put on strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; working conditions for re@@ mun@@ eration for northern oil workers are exposed , while all dispute parties will set a round table on the table , said the negoti@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes on the oil @-@ field service provider Wood Group were conducted spor@@ adic at platforms in the North Sea organised by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT unions can be confirmed that we have agreed to begin the process of the current stri@@ fe , &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will stop several day sessions in the coming weeks , will start at the beginning of next year to restart the problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the unions said that its last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against potential wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , Wood Group has reduced the rates to its contra@@ ctors in the North Sea by about 9 percent due to negative market pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Scottish parliament , by Dave Anderson , met with workers in the beginning of this week to discuss one of the greatest working disputes which took place in the North Sea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the North Sea is important for the regional economy . he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need a business that works for many and not only a few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 , fewer than $ 1.4 billion will be expected to spending new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures rotating rates of stars in the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with Ke@@ pler Wel@@ mare telescop@@ es has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue on rotating rates below the stars of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new data will help the astronom@@ ers to understand why the stars in the star cluster too rot@@ ate , as well as in which context the rot@@ ational periods with the planetary origin stand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope that through the compar@@ ative of our results with other constellation , Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s inf@@ ra Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , said in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is situated 4@@ 45 light@@ years from the earth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many stars in this constellation originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are now doing the quick@@ est way .
these ri@@ pping stars viol@@ ate large quantities at star@@ ches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the winds travel through the pul@@ leys of the stars , they have an braking effect on the stars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a star is age , its rotation speed begins to slow down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rot@@ ational rate of each death by recogni@@ zing the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ zable star@@ spot -- as sun@@ spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest catalog of rot@@ ational rates indicates that a more massive , more massive stars revol@@ ve than less massive stars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers and larger stars slower than smaller pi@@ rou@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Ballet &quot; of Ple@@ j@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very light stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare position rates such as rot@@ ational rates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cluster of the Ple@@ j@@ ades has a anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is much more than we would like to learn more about how , when and why their stars are slow down and watching their &quot; dancing shoes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of the Ple@@ j@@ ades &apos; latest analysis , which will soon be published at the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a controversial Bas@@ eball @-@ Star starting
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tears stopped at Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the US Bas@@ eball Star in best days from base to base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following his emotional return announcement , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will carry on the T@@ ampa Bay R@@ ays a last time the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I tell &quot; Good@@ bye &quot; to the &quot; stated that the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participants in the major league bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three times Rodri@@ guez was elected to the most valuable player of the League , in 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es World Series . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his signature under a ten@@ ant yearly deal gave him 27 million US dollars a year since 2007 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the end of the contrast on 31 December 2017 , he will be active as a consultant and youth coach - in full content . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as players paid it Rodri@@ guez for a long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marine ( 1994 to 2004 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 @-@ 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed to earn some mil@@ estones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the Hall of F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron , and Willi@@ e M@@ ays only show two more bas@@ eball player in the most important statistics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is probably not to be included in the glory hall of the bas@@ eball .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for so successful Rodri@@ guez - a nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - on the field , his appearance is outside the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star was called &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 that banned ster@@ oids . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in August 2013 , he was locked to 211 games for 211 games due to a performance in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ guez is regarded as the main susp@@ ect , for years on an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a legal dispute the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done a favour in 2014 , because I had played a break for 20 years without a break , &quot; Rodri@@ guez said then . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his farewell days also run smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while many bas@@ eball legends have once again preserved the big stage , Rodri@@ guez had to sit on the bench . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job will try to win any game &quot; &quot; failed Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , Rodri@@ guez , who was married with the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az , had been married with Pop@@ star Madonna and the act@@ ress Kate Hudson , the Y@@ ank@@ ee Erz@@ riv@@ alen Boston Red So@@ x fans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Per@@ hin@@ sky are first d@@ oping attacks
W@@ ho@@ the@@ ber Adrian Shi@@ z@@ hin@@ sky should not start in Rio because of a positive d@@ oping trial .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official d@@ oping .
a caught ath@@ let had won almost one medal .
before the seventh race day the first official d@@ oping attacks are known for the Rio de Janeiro &apos;s Olympic Games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chinese flo@@ wery in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre @-@ h@@ unters from Bulgaria and the Polish weight li@@ fter of Adrian Shi@@ z@@ hin@@ sky have been tested positively in Brazil - directly before the start of the anyway @-@ critical Ath@@ le@@ tics competitions this news will come out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ch@@ en was already proven the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ ked agent for d@@ oping substances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the International Society Court confirmed on Friday afternoon with their exclusion from the Olympic Games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the final about 100 m of butterfly , only around 0.@@ 09 seconds it missed the bronze medal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ch@@ en would have to take part in the operations over 50 metres of Freis@@ til on Friday .
Ch@@ en has applied for the opening of the B trial and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the national association charges &quot; very seriously , and requires Ch@@ en full cooperation with the studies , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will collabor@@ ate with the International Sport@@ sman Office and will accept the verdict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history is no longer the IO@@ C but the CAS for the san@@ ction of the ath@@ lete with positive cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the night of Rio , the news about the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ ova by the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all neg@@ atively , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; stated the athle@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report it is said to act with the forbidden substance of the EP@@ O blood d@@ oping agent .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa was provis@@ ion@@ ally suspended , according to B@@ NT the B trial should have been positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w reported immediately with criticism of the Ath@@ le@@ bul@@ letin at Word .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sports@@ men do not pull the right conclusions , &quot; said : &quot; we Bulgarian are standing under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all weight li@@ fter from the chron@@ ically d@@ op@@ ing@@ loaded nation must not take part in Rio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , the case of &quot; Adrian Per@@ inski &quot; was also known , as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z has been tested positive for three days earlier on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both deny the intake , but both may not start in class up to 94 kg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the race start , especially the case Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ owa is another severe blow for the reputation of the entire sport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the IA@@ AF World Federation had prohibited the whole Russian team up to an exception for systematic d@@ oping , also the L@@ äu@@ nation Kenya produced numerous bad news . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the swimming pool there were also earlier journeys in China for severe disputes between athletes .
the Fren@@ chman Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium over 200 m of Freis@@ til , I will commit myself and said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also in the centre of a meditation with the Australi@@ ans M@@ ack H@@ orton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for D@@ oping cou@@ sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was in 2014 positive with the Chinese Championships on the Stim@@ ul@@ ans Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din had to sit only a three @-@ month lock .
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : as per@@ fi@@ de comp@@ resses h@@ ack@@ ers her ran@@ som
programm@@ ers of ex@@ tor@@ ungs @-@ malware attack targeted companies - and are successful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a recent survey of the malware protection specialist Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the ques@@ tioned firms have been ques@@ tioned at least once a multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail@@ ser software . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany almost 20 percent of the companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware @-@ ex@@ tor@@ tion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 40 per cent of the victims are prepared to be disp@@ le@@ ased by the perpet@@ rators , to be able to use the requested systems and data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offen@@ ders speci@@ alize their black@@ ma@@ iler software according to the observ@@ ations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes on attacks in company networks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are successful there , the potential sol@@ ation benefit falls significantly higher than in private use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we currently observe an terri@@ fying fast evolution of the pollut@@ ant software &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chef Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot;
in 2008 most Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising .
then the crimin@@ als discovered it software for themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first of all , private use was the goal but the transition to company attacks has been sc@@ ary fast in the past few months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once active on a computer of a victim . search for invisible changed files such as Word@@ - , Excel or database files as well as after archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als lasting .
the software will then be presented to the demands of black@@ mail@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get the turn@@ key code to the files , the victims must include money - mostly in the form of the Cryp@@ to@@ o Bit@@ coin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but where private users use the personal photo database , it &apos;s related to companies for sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly the damage fails when a ran@@ som@@ ware is compens@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 percent of the affected German companies registered share losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent had to break down the business activity , in case of a case people were in danger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany several times the victims of attacks , their patients can be threatened by loss of acute illness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we always say to the cas@@ u@@ alties : don &apos;t pay anything that it promotes only the problem &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
but 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay you will get their data back .
it is difficult for managers to reject the demand of the perpet@@ rators in the operation .
the h@@ ack@@ ers know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a current study , the security researchers of F @-@ Secure have examined the commercial areas and contact with the results : the crimin@@ als are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they explain their victims by chat , as they can pay via Bit@@ coin , direct access sites or dec@@ ryp@@ t free example files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and shall make private individuals within a few hundred euros , companies must pay roughly hard and wag@@ ered fi@@ ber@@ y sum@@ s to return their data un@@ encrypted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky winn@@ ings from the ran@@ som@@ ware @-@ ex@@ tor@@ tion the h@@ ack@@ ers are always professional and split by the anti @-@ virus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
it is more likely that there are three or four people .
the programm@@ ers sell their pollut@@ ants in the form of a software building modular to the actual black@@ pressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the previous malware scan were created by malware , advice and additional tools for a single , fixed price between 1000 and $ 10,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; included in the scope of supply is an adaptation tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the black@@ pressed then are looking for more h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the freshly bought software under the victims .
we live in a service economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , in one of the forums in the underground , one bu@@ ys the set of a crime and commissioned another software to install the software on your many PCs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
payment is made per month computer .
&quot; usually the crimin@@ als then use sp@@ ammer in the spread . &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that safegu@@ ard their data .
over 50 per cent of the companies @-@ IT leaders in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes Survey opt to rely on Ran@@ som@@ ware via file back @-@ ups and scan software .
accordingly the crimin@@ als pursue new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone is no sufficient threat to successful earnings , the perpet@@ rators are explained instead by publication of sensitive data such as client lists or prize calculations , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chef Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
making the case of damage depending on the type of data is much higher than before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in future , the crimin@@ als could take out completely new goals in the internet of things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con demonstrated security researchers as they were able to control a thermo@@ stat via the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of winter , the activation of such a der@@ art heater could not be worth a ran@@ som . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the crimin@@ als then block an entire factory in the future instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a subject in Industry 4.0 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday @-@ resistant
in the small HR @-@ V Honda is happy to pack everything : a little SUV and a little Coupé and also the versatility of a mini@@ vans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , is actually very flexible in everyday life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is only 1.@@ 60 m high HR V rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the front row as well as in the rear , it works in no place tight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials of the interior space are well finished and have a pleasant , only the cockpit top is there something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles .
there is not only a luggage boot from 4@@ 53 l at high @-@ up and 10@@ 26 l at inver@@ ted back @-@ rests . but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
this is less mag@@ ically less than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like bo@@ ilers and thus provide storage space that is up to a height of 1.@@ 24 metres from the bottom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boot space can be loaded well , but the load @-@ height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tested 1.6 @-@ l @-@ diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR @-@ V torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges very powerful .
but he is likely to do his work a bit more quiet .
pleasing is the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km .
there is another additional mot@@ ori@@ zation : a 1.5 @-@ litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the handling is balanced and a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but steering is likely to be something more direct .
the equipment is open to the &quot; Executive &quot; top version &quot; in the top version &quot; Executive . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; access to security systems is the City emergency braking system ( working at temp@@ o 32 ) , the coll@@ ision system and the assistant director . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the coll@@ ision avo@@ ids sometimes because he has assessed many obstacles as &quot; her@@ ent objects . &quot;
the remote @-@ lighting assistant is very reliable .
and the intelligent Tem@@ po@@ regulator respon@@ ds to the speed record recognition and thr@@ ott@@ les the speed when needed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the full connectivity is however only available for top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touchscreen , Nav@@ i , App integration and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two USB@@ - and a HDMI @-@ socket are available under the arm@@ rest and are therefore a bit cum@@ ber@@ some to reach .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top @-@ diesel in order .
who doesn &apos;t want to invest in such a way will the petrol engine will receive from 200@@ 00 Euro to the diesel starting from 23@@ 000 Euro .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
Honda offers a versatile and versatile car with the HR @-@ V .
Air@@ line is not liable : down@@ fall on passenger jet@@ ty
a airline is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a liability is possible only with danger , which are typical for air traffic , argu@@ ed the Higher Regional Court in Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ lä@@ ger had broken in the overthrow of a knee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the accident could have happen anywhere - it is a universal life risk , so the court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the airline had to pay no damage to the man .
cases of illness : when paid
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after their journey , ill tourists get back then only money when the cause of the disease is dou@@ bt@@ less in the hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this is only the case , if more than ten percent of the guests have shown to show the same symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this failed case , a family was hit hard by diarr@@ he@@ a during the second day of their Turkish ill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their illness put back the vac@@ ation@@ ists to a defective se@@ wage plant , which supposedly poll@@ uted sea@@ water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the family was the view , the journey had been a lack of business - and appe@@ aled to the organis@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of court the b@@ lä@@ ger had no success .
indeed the se@@ wage situation in fact was defective .
but the organizer did not notice any time before departure of the K@@ lä@@ ger .
it had to run until then that the sea water was fine .
so he has not viol@@ ated his information obligations so the verdict .
especially in the samples of water no contamination were found .
the illness of multiple hotel guests - probably due to infection to each other - belonging to the general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests were only 38 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , following the violent crimes in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people have concerned with many proposals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state had to sit and react at the same time on terrorist .
surely : our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ r@@ ator with hatred and split .
this triumph will not allow the terr@@ orists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if crimin@@ als had to leave the country faster , the security and strength also force the consent of the population for refugee policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to achieve the proposals until the end of the Bundestag in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personalized reinforcement of security forces , namely &quot; in a medium @-@ size mag@@ nit@@ ude over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympath@@ ies for terrorism require to be under punishment .
video surveillance is supposed to be improved as amended on the subject of particular the purchase of weapons in the Internet .
the last much @-@ mentioned Swiss sec@@ rec@@ y for doctors will remain vic@@ t@@ orious according to de Mai@@ zi@@ ères .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if he wants to search for solutions in a dialogue with regard to solutions , as the end@@ an@@ gering of citizens can be dimin@@ ished , he said with a view of psychological beli@@ efs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to counter@@ act the radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister holds even better social assistance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
teachers need to be better prepared to deal with trusted people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the persecution of crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the deployment of injured investig@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SPD boss Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to enhance safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the interior minister was clearly stated against action of action .
&quot; this was a ear@@ nest for the f@@ itter in the CDU / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel did the newspapers of the spark media group ( Friday ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , Ru@@ gs from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the aboli@@ tion of double citizenship previously rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a general prohibition of complete conc@@ ei@@ ving for constitu@@ tionally un@@ proble@@ matic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t forbi@@ d everything one re@@ jects , and I reject the wearing of the Bur@@ ka . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green principal in Simone Peter designed the Minister , he wants to sim@@ ulate new anti @-@ terror p@@ act and action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; fleet PRO@@ VER@@ BS , &quot; A pro@@ curing of the right of residence , bring people in this country no more safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow to the fre@@ eway
a look at the main road - here is a picture of November .
but that shall change : the rule of law shall be extended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is good news for all car drivers , who are in the field of professional traffic on the surrounding road every evening at the St@@ au when they crossed the fre@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
road construction extends on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between Hammer Straße and the downhill Wes@@ eler road going down the left lane by 700 meters .
drivers can turn right off from the hammer Street to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the big advantage : the traffic shares early , which will increase the total sequence of the un@@ connected section of the federal road 51 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea of the extended exit was the CDU faction in the District Military embassy in Münster @-@ West .
the road@@ way back on the Zu@@ br@@ inger get nervous driving between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
the back@@ lash is enough to bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ fjord and sometimes also beyond .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reason is the needle &apos;s clock on the B 51 , just before the descent Wes@@ eler Street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from here traffic will only be lowered on the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be rebuilt in front of a quarter of three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason : static calculations have shown that the bridge is no longer required to take the required load , especially to record heavy traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long of this bott@@ len@@ eck and associated with the associated st@@ au is ongoing , the competent country is not able to say . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is possible to count with years : because the bridge has an official resi@@ dual service life until 20@@ 34 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ately , the state farm deliber@@ ately chose the traffic @-@ weaker period in the school holidays because with disabilities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
traffic will be run on Tuesday and Wednesday at the site .
Inter@@ cultural trip : cultural offers for schools
the international grade of Wald@@ schule visited the theatre piece &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the Club N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre are planning a music project now .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
the &quot; class International &quot; of the nur@@ ser@@ y school has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning pieces &quot; The invisible house &quot; of the Young Theatre in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural trip &quot; there were 19 students between eleven and 15 years , the st@@ aging in the little house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the year , the association organis@@ es the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , schools with welcome leave the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most you@@ ths in the class were between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others , Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and say little German . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographi@@ es , scenic pictures and video animations , it was possible to follow the course of action , so the press release of the boy theatre Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Club N@@ ima &apos;s ( founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg from Language ) and the Young Theatre will collabor@@ ate in the framework of a musical theatre project in the coming season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from October to December young people with and without refugee and a migration background between 14 and 20 years will get the opportunity to visit professionally organized courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
offers for children and families in the field of theatre and theat@@ rical language surveys are planned .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; goes on .
in the face of Asc@@ ended refugee numbers the association counts with many classes coming to participate .
Regen instead of star d@@ olls : hope for wet weather
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the weather has done the star @-@ d@@ olls in South@@ west Germany at night , on Friday a das@@ h through the bill , but there is still hope . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the night was poor because of clouds and rain was badly suited for watching the card@@ inal spectacle , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the weather should be good , then we &apos;ll surely see a lot of the stars in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the ast@@ er@@ ships , it is per@@ tin@@ den that belong to the quick@@ est star type with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they don &apos;t have your name because they apparently come from the constellation Per@@ se@@ us that goes in the north east .
relaxing overnight : tips against sleeping problems
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the evening one is dancing et@@ ern@@ ally , at night , one is awake for hours , and in the morning you can no longer think of sleep anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is all other than rest@@ ful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , with such problems in good society : according to the Robert Koch Institute , approximately one @-@ quarter of adult sleeping disorders and more than ten percent feel frequent or permanent than not relaxing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleep problems ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are several forms of sleeping disorders , and it may lead to them many causes , empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter Wo@@ e , board member of the German Society of slaugh@@ tering and sleeping medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what under@@ stands there , is the In@@ som@@ nia , so an in@@ som@@ ing and passing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just that long sleep happens to many people as uns@@ atis@@ factory or in@@ sufficient , says Jens Car@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , member of the member of the German Building Medical Association with Practice at the Lower Saxony Var@@ el . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is behind sleeping problems ?
the causes of sleeping disorders are complex .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behind these , organic , psych@@ ic or behavi@@ our@@ al factors can also stick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not rarely is the sleep distur@@ bing of another condition .
&quot; very early awakening is often frequent with a depression &quot; says We@@ alth .
and it can be that different factors are than@@ king one another .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc can &apos;t be bad , wake up every two to three hours and cat@@ ches , over everyday problems and -@@ worry , there are We@@ ap@@ an example . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to tension or sleep is no longer possible .
when should I have problems with sleep problems ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who do not sleep well over a month in at least three nights per week and imp@@ aired on the day , should consult the physician . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; impair@@ ment can be very different : one gets tired , tired , un@@ paved , has difficulty with attention and concentration , has difficulty fluctu@@ ations or bodily troub@@ les like stomach or head@@ ache . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to alle@@ vi@@ ate the sleeping troub@@ les is it important to find out its causes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as therapeutic options , behavi@@ oral changes , cognitive behavi@@ oral therapy or other medicines - classic sleep tablets can only be found for two weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; headquartered in Germany , Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etz@@ e , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary Research Center , Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin , is hardly possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , you should contact the doctor &apos;s physician at sleeping difficulties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it can clari@@ fy with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep laboratory and what will happen ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to study at sleep laboratory Medical , for example in snor@@ ing with respiratory suffer@@ ers , in case of painful periods of day or if you don &apos;t find the cause of a sleeping disorder , Fi@@ etz@@ e explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we don &apos;t have to prepare for research .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not just take a nap , &quot; says Fi@@ etz@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after glu@@ ing it on to its normal time in bed .
in addition to the electrodes in the body you have a nas@@ al g@@ og@@ gles , a chest strap and a antennas on the finger .
the camera also shows the sleeping on the ceiling .
how can people get a grip on the problems ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are rather many adjusting screws , where one can sleep for a better sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We@@ alth counts : regular bed@@ time and rise , not too long in bed , do not even watch TV for sleep , stop drinking alcohol at night - and that &apos;s all right and not favorable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what makes the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has sent itself on Facebook to dis@@ appoint the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in December 2014 , he took the first world championships in Doha and took his first world record at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ lete Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has been protecting the explosion @-@ team @-@ mate via Facebook .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where a Olympic champion receives 20,000 € premium and a jungle heads , nobody was supposed to be wonder@@ ing about missing medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old on Friday on his Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the transport system in the swimming pool is bad and the d@@ oping control is very good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this we cannot compete with countries that promote very much , and not even operate the issue of D@@ oping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not saying that the controls are supposed to be adjusted here , &quot; he explained further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wanted to start a com@@ eback , nine months before his first start to the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Deutschland ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if not a certain period of O@@ WM / OS can be controlled by independent Controll@@ ers of the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A , &quot; the Hamburg election maker , who has meanwhile runs an ice cream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de of Bag of baggage arrest
professional th@@ iev@@ es at the airport Düsseldorf
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , civil servants of Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police reached the arrest of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crime susp@@ ects had committed multiple bags and baggage paraly@@ sis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against 21.@@ 30 , civil officials in the area of the airport Düsseldorf became a gang back that was known to the polic@@ emen from past theft . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two women and two men had committed several dol@@ ph@@ ins since the middle of July this year , and were very professional and very professional . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the specialists from the crime Commissioner 34 can participate in the th@@ iev@@ es , which were specially visiting for the crimes of criminal off@@ ences in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had exploited more than 15,000 Euros in total .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; old buildings , a few li@@ a@@ vers in between , and another cob@@ bled pav@@ ement : the Riga @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain doesn &apos;t seem so much at first sight , but the police belong to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you walk along the road from east to west , one gets over at play@@ grounds , a fri@@ ghtened kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
someone is spra@@ yed to the facade of a gray house ! &quot; spra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opposite to a Li@@ dl , which is to be demolished soon , it will be built here : by 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; article on this &quot; trendy area , &quot; like the real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain , is preferred with burning cars over the last few weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile , the residents are occupied , but in the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin internal conductor , the area referred explicitly to the project as a &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ zone &quot; for police officers and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor that had been cleared up with 300 police officers , the police patented three weeks according to site , locked parts of the road and stopped attending the house with number 94 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile renovated building workers on behalf of the unknown landlord owners the rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 13 July , a Berlin administration Court decided that the spati@@ ality had been illegal and a day later police and building workers moved under the it@@ ers of sympath@@ is@@ ers and residents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on this summer afternoon the road appears peaceful : parents walk with children walk along the pav@@ ement in front of the houses in the sun and others are talking about pre@@ h@@ ät@@ i .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ sti@@ n Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has lived in the K@@ ie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , which are here three children , are all generated from the police presence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the inhabitants of the building project they share the concern of rising mi@@ ties and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a k@@ ie@@ z that is in favour of the multi @-@ sc@@ andal@@ ous left before the sc@@ andal@@ ous left .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin interior pul@@ ator and the police are between home owners and their neigh@@ bors , does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional workers quarter , which also today in comparison to the rest of the city , and high wages of poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even house projects and the new@@ born housing projects have been a long time for K@@ ie@@ z : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , among them nearly the entire Main@@ zer street near the Riga . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the Main@@ zer has been cleared in a proper road battle , many of the projects in the Rig@@ a@@ er were leg@@ alized and are still inhabited by people who had occupied them 26 years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , the district has become increasingly recognized for tourists and elec@@ trop@@ ers from all over the world : with them local residents from East times and former house occupied their K@@ ie@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is also noticeable in the rentals , which have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : you can recognize them at the dis@@ car@@ ded slices or freshly painted fac@@ ades , that were thrown out with dyes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other road was mentioned this year as often with the words &quot; left autonomous power . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one reason why not all neighbours as a problem may be regard , may be that they are not necessarily affected by crimin@@ ality : perpet@@ rates such as body hurt themselves according to almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the criminal off@@ ences make atomic damage , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Ker@@ sti@@ n Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lived for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94 , cannot be any talk of uncertainty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of violence , it is important : people in the 94 are their neigh@@ bors who have been destined to be sure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the famous burning cars can also be kept directly in the Rig@@ a@@ er longer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for studying architect , her road is not a criminal focus , on the opposite : &quot; here one lives together , lives together on the road and gets more than elsewhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliber@@ ately drawn into the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße - and remained .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it was also so important that local residents are getting back their road : from police , politics and the media , which suddenly stressed the interpretation of the city in July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : by si@@ bl@@ less new buildings in former building blocks that squee@@ ze the old inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are ultimately property apartments that are not interesting for many people - here are rather people , who are not so good , &quot; says them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I can absolutely ignore &quot; violence and destruction . &quot;
but what shall we do if an never man hear@@ eth ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on all pages of fru@@ stration , there is also the police and the inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Zu@@ ge@@ zo@@ omed , who like more than color bombs , Ker@@ sti@@ n has a little understanding : the building projects and the left scene belonged to K@@ ie@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who pull , should be aware of this - just like anyone who is moving into a pub area , compl@@ ain about noise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all persons submitted only with Vor@@ names were asked to be called by their right names , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ur@@ bach : An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee lecturer
An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner for integration and organizer .
in addition she is a social worker from the village .
since July An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le became the refugee lecturer for Ur@@ bach .
the social educ@@ ator supports the team of the management um Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she sees itself as contact for all actors : refugees , labor group refugee assistance , administration , authorities and who else still mi@@ xes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Reg@@ ine customer from the working circle indicates that Deu@@ sch@@ le is more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there that has a problem of ei@@ ving wool mel@@ t@@ sau .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , some - less scra@@ p than on the multitude of desired task @-@ indications - meant that the administration wanted to write the position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeking a gi@@ ven@@ tional power with a talent for languages and people , connected to many years of experience in the field of social work , just an enthusiastic Woll@@ um@@ ch@@ sau . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but administrative labour is not its core area , says An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; above all , it is around organization , working with people on @-@ site and also behind the scenes as well as network facilities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been with us for about six weeks .
it has mat@@ ured a 50 per cent point to three years .
&quot; it was high time &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer that An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is supported and full @-@ time actors .
there are large and small problems , organiz@@ ational , human and communication problems .
soon new containers in the Was@@ n Road
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a grave problem has been , since some time , to find homes for connectivity refugees that have been recognized . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the municipalities are responsible for connecting the assembly .
they must enter@@ tain the refugees in their own or hired living rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must carry the commun@@ es itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the responsibility changes from the Department of Agriculture to the municipality and job@@ centre .
problem : there are free objects but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
it has been a very difficult search for some time now .
the administration does not find private apartments de facto .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; working previously , we do not work on private apartments , thus Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore non@@ commercial dwell@@ ings must be gu@@ ised as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will be installed in the Was@@ n Road .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword means Reg@@ ine Custom@@ ers and An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to a fixed stay there are internship plac@@ ements , training places , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and exhau@@ sting activities for refugees and migrants must have to be und@@ inn@@ ed or arranged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more places would be good &quot; says Reg@@ ine customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many work in the building yard or help house masters , do not carry char@@ itable work - and that &apos;s motiv@@ ating and very neat , as An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it hopes that the work for the commun@@ ion is leading to a positive external effect .
this is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but his work is not just a job .
the day need a permanent structure to say Deu@@ sch@@ le and Custom@@ ers .
people had to develop a feeling of ir@@ regul@@ arity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , there are offers such as sport , contacts with locals and especially language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
professional courses are ra@@ r .
so they also jump here to administration and honor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is central that the refugees have received the feeling , they are welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
long @-@ term duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need to explain the refugees that it takes , and can bridge the time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever wants to develop the feeling that he could not work in Ur@@ bach , would not work and be un@@ profitable to never integrate itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the obvious majority may be motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but problems there are also , says customer honest , &quot; people , with which nothing goes . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and Customer is always something to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all this is already a &quot; Mamm@@ ut@@ task &quot; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a difficult question : have they afraid of radic@@ alization , even in a small church like Ur@@ bach ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , does Reg@@ ine say quite clearly what many rich na@@ i@@ v may call it . &quot; a resi@@ dual risk might be and does not exclu@@ de them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers be susp@@ icious .
these inci@@ dents occur in the case of the refugees .
they fear the fear that the attacks they put them completely in call .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it . &quot; says Reg@@ ine customers .
many would love to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so we have to look for main and volunteers on the spot and in the region to activities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they always have in the background , that soon a new impact on refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does Germany need an upper limit ?
to answer this question clearly is the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually , it is un@@ fair to place them in local presence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived here yet , where we would like , &quot; says An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are no new refugees to relax .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes clear that the Ur@@ b@@ acher also has already tried to integrate the previous people sensi@@ bly .
there are currently around 100 persons that are mainly young men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when people in need of emergency , one should help them , both women are embar@@ rass@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the political situation is so complicated , there is no easy answers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : in@@ crimin@@ als looking for by helicopter
the police @-@ helicopter flew different areas for about one hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men are for@@ ci@@ bly roasted on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 am on Friday morning in a apartment house in the Lind@@ en@@ weg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inhabitants over@@ took the two , and smote the Un@@ d@@ els in the run . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two men were approximately 1,@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 meters high , probably mas@@ ked , both were both Blue@@ je@@ ans and black hoo@@ ded hoo@@ die . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she fled direction downtown .
the police pursued several strips of strikes and a police helicopter .
the discovery went without success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the in@@ famous , before the apartment , were in fact close to the apartment or on their escape . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
