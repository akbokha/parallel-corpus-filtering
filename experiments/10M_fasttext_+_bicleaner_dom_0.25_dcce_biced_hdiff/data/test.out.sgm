<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels something lonely on to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "he said," If he wins two gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight. "" "" "" "</seg>

<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were driven down.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "" "" "there were Dramas in the background, as the withdrawal of the technical guide Shane Sutton in April in the middle of Sagraph- and Mobbingers, and the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="3">In addition she is a social worker from the village.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle became the refugee lecturer for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social educator supports the team of the management um Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "she sees itself as contact for all actors: refugees, labor group refugee assistance, administration, authorities and who else still mixes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer from the working circle indicates that Deuschle is more than thankful that Deuschle is now there that has a problem of eiving wool meltsau.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "so, some - less scrap than on the multitude of desired task-indications - meant that the administration wanted to write the position." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "seeking a giventional power with a talent for languages and people, connected to many years of experience in the field of social work, just an enthusiastic Wollumchsau." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative labour is not its core area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "above all, it is around organization, working with people on-site and also behind the scenes as well as network facilities." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been with us for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has matured a 50 per cent point to three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time" says Regine customer that Annika Deuschle is supported and full-time actors.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers in the Wasn Road</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "a grave problem has been, since some time, to find homes for connectivity refugees that have been recognized." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for connecting the assembly.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must entertain the refugees in their own or hired living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "the cost of construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must carry the communes itself." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Department of Agriculture to the municipality and jobcentre.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">It has been a very difficult search for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">The administration does not find private apartments de facto.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "working previously, we do not work on private apartments, thus Deuschle." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore noncommercial dwellings must be guised as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be installed in the Wasn Road.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword means Regine Customers and Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "in addition to a fixed stay there are internship placements, training places, school grounds, one-euro jobs and exhausting activities for refugees and migrants must have to be undinned or arranged." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good" says Regine customers.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "many work in the building yard or help house masters, do not carry charitable work - and that's motivating and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reported." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that the work for the communion is leading to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But his work is not just a job.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day need a permanent structure to say Deuschle and Customers.</seg>
<seg id="37">People had to develop a feeling of irregularity.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "so, there are offers such as sport, contacts with locals and especially language courses." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">So they also jump here to administration and honor.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "it is central that the refugees have received the feeling, they are welcome and welcome in Germany." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Long-term duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "" "" "you need to explain the refugees that it takes, and can bridge the time wisely, for example with language courses." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "" "" "whoever wants to develop the feeling that he could not work in Urbach, would not work and be unprofitable to never integrate itself." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The obvious majority may be motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "" "" "but problems there are also, says customer honest," people, with which nothing goes. "the work of Deuschle and Customer is always something to motivate others." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "Mammuttask".</seg>
<seg id="48">"" "" "" "a difficult question: have they afraid of radicalization, even in a small church like Urbach?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "" no, does Regine say quite clearly what many rich naiv may call it. "a residual risk might be and does not exclude them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers be suspicious.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents occur in the case of the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They fear the fear that the attacks they put them completely in call.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it." says Regine customers.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would love to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So we have to look for main and volunteers on the spot and in the region to activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "they always have in the background, that soon a new impact on refugees and migrants could come to Urbach." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need an upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly is the policy.</seg>
<seg id="59">"" "" "" "actually, it is unfair to place them in local presence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "" in Urbach we haven't arrived here yet, where we would like, "says Annika Deuschle." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="61">There are no new refugees to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes clear that the Urbacher also has already tried to integrate the previous people sensibly.</seg>
<seg id="63">There are currently around 100 persons that are mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "but when people in need of emergency, one should help them, both women are embarrassed." "" "" ""</seg>
