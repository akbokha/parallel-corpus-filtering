Obama receiving Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as by Teh@@ ran , dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ zing measures in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but with the encounter , there should also be a conflict with the Palest@@ inians and the discussed two @-@ states solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the continuing sett@@ lements of Israel and throws Net@@ any@@ ahu sil@@ ently to the peace process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Obama &apos;s de@@ ceased deal , the Iranian nuclear program has wor@@ sen@@ ed itself over the relationship of the two . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had given an controversial speech by the US Congress in front of the US Congress which was partly considered an aff@@ ront of Obama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speech ended with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the upcoming election in Israel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a call to emer@@ gen@@ cies Professor his friend is shot to have shot
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a call to emer@@ ge , Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb spoke with a somewhat dirty voice to the police , that he had shot his friend and that the officials would have to come to his house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb was to emphas@@ ise that his &quot; cute dog &quot; but still alive and probably excited , and he said , the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inside the house , the officers found the cor@@ p@@ ses of Amy P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss and a hand@@ written notice I was sorry . I loved Amy and she was the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was according to the details of the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no indication that Lamb who was conducted in two online courses for the delta State University in C@@ lev@@ eland , Mississi@@ ppi , where he was shot and killed by the police for the police , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ mark Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that I staff members have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 hrs .
he said that Lamb has made the fatal emergency call then sometime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until the end of the day there was another death : he took the life , when the police met him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one day after the shooting in the university , students and lec@@ turers for@@ sake themselves to hide behind closed doors , the authorities are still trying to gain a picture of what was motivated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the details published by the issu@@ res of the state published details , including what students and employees who knew him , helped him to draw a picture of a talented , but maybe difficult teachers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
students know that they were looking forward to his lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police at Gau@@ tier , where P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss died , said he has no history of violence or criminal history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned his book written in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with which he divided his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Department of Social Sciences and History , they included 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time there were some inclin@@ ation to proble@@ matic behavior .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said that he seemed a little upset and nervous , as if something was wrong with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had told him at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 with stress . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , Lamb had asked the Delta State University to ask for health reasons and told that he had any health problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year he taught only two courses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newest changes in employment policies of the university , meant that the doctorate , which Lamb had worked so hard for him , would not constitute an automatic way to an employment as assistant Professor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge told , he didn &apos;t know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that I can &apos;t answer the Lamb .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the flight from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs track when he returned into Mississi@@ ppi from Arkan@@ s@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before he could arrested the Lamb made himself a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a home about a mile south of his parents on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson .
his car still ran in the dri@@ v@@ eway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that she knew that he knew the people who lived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb began its work at the University , the 3,@@ 500 students in a city with around 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagog@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he received his doctorate in spring in spring .
one of the long @-@ term friends Lam@@ bs marked him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ la Hair@@ ston said , she was 15 and he was 20 , when they met together for joint friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy , who tried to teach her guitar playing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was then the Moon Black .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls s@@ mol@@ ten when he was there , Hair@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson suburbs of Bran@@ don living in the city of Bran@@ don . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss were obviously working together for some time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog called Light@@ ning that lived with them in the brick house that was adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ husband of P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they had been divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed at the ground &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en on his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb but I heard it from his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail that he was interested in music and played the blues .
Lamb met P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss for three years ago when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail came up two years ago .
later they played together the one or another .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said that his daughter writes and sings their own music .
P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss was a nurse which has worked for various companies online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ tender and sometimes Entertainment Coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lumin@@ ous bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he finished his guitar and P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss Night in the night before a cute audience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no evidence that anything was not right .
&quot; just a happy couple &quot; he said .
we were at the premises and j@@ oked with each other .
I mean they both had a good sense for j@@ okes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt , the tot@@ e professor , led the first @-@ term seminar program and specialized on American na@@ tives and colonial history , &quot; Don Allan Mitchell , an English professor at school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he studied at the University of Kansas , where he was president of his Brotherhood and the Student Committee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday evening , approximately 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in C@@ lev@@ eland , including teachers , staff , students , and members of the commune at a candle light celebration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ mid@@ wife &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother J@@ eff Schmidt also took part in the guard station , while the University &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Amazing Grace &quot; sang . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lessons are res@@ umed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to returning , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .

Associated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississi@@ ppi and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this story has been corrected to resist the police now saying that Lamb was shot , and that he referred to his wife called P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss , but there was no indication of the two who got married . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michael J. Fox H@@ ush on his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was remarkable also for personal reasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sat in the theatre for the Roy@@ als , and I realize that the seat will be empty beside me , and it will gradually be obvious that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the film begins , and it comes to me in my mind that I am a sim@@ ulated ge@@ aring and an ar@@ ming length of it , with the Princess from Wales on a Date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; - A documentary about &quot; Back to the Future &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Lea Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd . and with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; had made its premiere 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s really good for me , &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; Un@@ str@@ it@@ one of the world &apos;s largest time travel film which has ever been shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be visible to VO@@ D , DVD and the selected cin@@ emas in October .
UN CEO says that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General B@@ an Ki @-@ moon tells his response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support to Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years lasting conflict and more weapons will only become worse by violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UN leader again calls for all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to un@@ ite and support all inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday , that he plans to meet Foreign Affairs of the five Permanent member nations of the United States , Russia , China , Great Britain , and France - on the edge of the Council &apos;s minist@@ erial meeting in this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he de@@ pl@@ orable the breakdown in the council , and within the Syrian people and the Regional powers &quot; would make this situation dis@@ sol@@ vable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ an called for the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity , which they have proved at the achievement of a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 Re@@ union values that show Donald Tr@@ ump is seriously to take .
some have tried to fire him as flop .
others have taken him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but no matter how certain Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks among p@@ olls , it still does not work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ten of the last eleven National meetings showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the two @-@ digit area , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of the real estate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course it is still too early in the election season .
no one claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the rep@@ ubli@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts predi@@ ct that at that time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys leadership was handed over to the rising Herman Cain , none of them won &apos;t become a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have strug@@ gling to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ bles like J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super P@@ AC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Tr@@ ump Particip@@ ating ability and start to flow out its dollar to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values that suggest that the real estate is not just a temporary phase :
tear popularity values have turned around 180 degrees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in the middle of June , that only two of ten women rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans have seen the real estate @-@ Mog@@ ul . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
in early August it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 Republi@@ can have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in the early States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa , last week found that 60 percent of the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of dumb@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two thirds of the GO@@ P v@@ oter GO@@ P would be happy with dump as candidates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the Republi@@ can , they would either be &quot; excited or &quot; satisfied , when Tr@@ ump would be nominated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only two of them say , they would be anno@@ yed &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only Ben Car@@ son manages about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say , they were &quot; thr@@ illed &quot; vs. 40 per cent who would say the same about drinking @-@ ump ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next in excitement ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with just 21 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of rep@@ ubli@@ can voters say that they would be &quot; un@@ happy , &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , the candidate would say . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a majority of Republi@@ can sees Tr@@ ump temper@@ ament not as a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely known for his bom@@ bas@@ tic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters turn the real temper@@ ament to a President , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the same number is valid in the initial state of the nation , the State of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ can think he has the personality for a colon@@ el , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , 44 percent say that he did not have the personality to effectively be effective and almost six out of 10 oun@@ ts say that its temper@@ ament does not fit into the White House , according to ABC / Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rep@@ ubli@@ can voters get used to the idea .
if they use their schol@@ ars and rep@@ ubli@@ can voters hold Tr@@ ump in real .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are asked , who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C four out of ten , that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a change since time , when four of the end of July replaced money on J@@ eb Bush . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
complete Dis@@ closure : GO@@ P voters had not the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this time in the last cycle four of ten rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry had the nomin@@ ees to win only 28 % for the final candidates &apos; Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
yet it shows that a variety of GO@@ P voters can watch Tr@@ ump campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the rep@@ ubli@@ can accumul@@ ate a different candidate , Tr@@ ump hits almost everybody still .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some experts point out that the sh@@ atter@@ ing field probably contributes to Tr@@ ump leadership , while the Anti @-@ dump support is diff@@ used to over a dozen other candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and the most other rep@@ ubli@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump is harv@@ ested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recently served with Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead of sailors 15 points and finally on the edge of Paul , John Ka@@ und and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a head @-@ on @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes it ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a narrow majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans says that they have formed their opinion .
a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters will support them that they have already forgiven their voices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say , never changing the mind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 46 percent said they let the door open , to change to other candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yet Tr@@ ump is powerful competition at the moment of other out@@ ites , neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters that have formed their minds are twice as often for drinking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
six of 10 rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say that they agree to immigration on immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ever since Donald Tr@@ ump in his electoral campaign , two months of immigrants from Mexico , was the Immig@@ ration and fishing point in the public dis@@ course to 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are worried that the bom@@ bas@@ tic escape of the Tr@@ ump of His@@ p@@ ano @-@ Americans will be remote @-@ kept from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the re@@ orient@@ ate effort .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday , six of 10 rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say that they agree to immigration in matters of immigration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so long as the immigration in the spot@@ light remains , Donald Tr@@ ump is apparent too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fru@@ stration on the government climb@@ s on new high@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , around half of the support of rep@@ ubli@@ can voters falls , especially by its out@@ sider status . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
six of 10 rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new mon@@ day survey of ABC / Post . they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience .
and they are also fur@@ ious at Washington .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Repub@@ lic@@ ans are fru@@ str@@ ated by the Republi@@ can , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ happy &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ishly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential objects in Germany
here in Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg is the most expensive residential community - with views over the North Sea .
the road costs 7@@ 3.@@ 300 Euro on the street in the street .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt the offer of objects is naturally limited &quot; so it is in the study - therefore the high price .
a new study shows that in which special layer one square metre is most cost .
of course 18.@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top housing , the price is like Pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ l has released a ranking of most exclusive German residential sites , with square met@@ ering prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are several tens of thousands of euro - per square meter .
but good to who can afford ...
by the way : Munich is an exception here not at the top .

the team of coach P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won the Champions League in the Champions League at the Greek record champion olymp@@ ic atmosphere in hot atmosphere thanks to the garbage double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and i@@ dol hits ( 8@@ 9th ) and i@@ ve wins with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth start of Star@@ ter@@ fol@@ g in series is to be the first step toward the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Müller , at his 28th place in the Champions League for Bayern guided visits of the olymp@@ i@@ os @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto , who had a well @-@ thought shot of the world champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t appreciate it , &quot; had promised Bayern Captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium , before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 h@@ ott@@ ling fans - and the Munich @-@ held word . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without being shine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ re@@ aus has won his youngest six home games in the class , including well @-@ known clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we also stum@@ bled at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they went brave , but in their offensive effort but often in@@ fu@@ tile to works .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the attacks were often initiated by playing , on the left side of the Left or Douglas Costa that rarely came against the former Braun@@ schwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Müller manufactured the right more fortun@@ ate than his flan@@ k from the right half field on the left upper to@@ re@@ ck was struck .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion had the possible 2 : 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best occasions in half had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , as the Olympics &apos; Imperial Ide@@ ye Brown hit the Pol@@ ball of Poland by the line ( 26 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then by direct removing , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto with the knees par@@ ted ( 3@@ 5. ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Bayern dominated the dominant game you could put Piraeus .
but Manuel Neuer has been on the door@@ ke@@ en Manuel Neuer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , as he drew a shot of ide@@ ye about the Lat@@ te ste@@ es ( 5@@ 6th ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ahead of New York , Guardi@@ ola landed a square with David Al@@ aba in the center near Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which did it well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mario id@@ ol@@ es . back to muscular problems back in the ca@@ der ; first sat outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero had given the green light only after the final training , said Sport@@ CFO Matthias Sam@@ mer in the Sky . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he who wants to do something else is mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola did against him when he carried out King@@ sley Com@@ an for the distant Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made only 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ m. there was another one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the game it was at the stadium of Kra@@ w@@ ang .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a smaller group of partly ver@@ m@@ ated Bayern fans obviously prov@@ oked the supporters of host Pir@@ aus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces came up and went with ra@@ ids against the Munich trailer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one Bayern fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes it has a higher risk to lose teeth
who smo@@ kes does not only harm the lungs but also the teeth - this puts a Potsdam &apos;s long @-@ term study .
good news : with c@@ law the risk sin@@ ks quickly .
smokers have much higher risk to lose their teeth early .
this emerged from a long @-@ term study of international research teams including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in comparison with non @-@ smokers , smokers were the risk to lose their teeth early , in order to 3.6 % up to 3.6 @-@ F@@ ache . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the scientists have observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
main causes of denti@@ sts be c@@ aries and inflammation of the gum tissue and empha@@ sizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis smoking is a risk factor that emphas@@ ise the authors .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth will therefore go back to frequent tooth infection in smokers .
not been clari@@ fied if smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who listened to smoking , could reduce their risk in a short time , the researchers report the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it can last more than ten years , until the threat to the level of non @-@ smokers , First @-@ author Thomas Dietrich von der English University Birmingham . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one should convince people of it , not to be smo@@ ot@@ ted , explained the manager of H@@ a Boeing 7@@ DI@@ E : &quot; smoking reduces the lifetime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking is good for lung and vessels , and leads to our knowledge also to a good dental health until high age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , over 20 percent of the population are affected by in@@ som@@ nia during the age of 65 to 74 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
earlier investigations have already pointed out that smoking is the risk of early to@@ g@@ out@@ age .
the new long @-@ term study leads the findings .
ar@@ che@@ ologists to@@ ast in Cologne Rhine river banks on resi@@ dues from the late anti@@ quity
for the repeated time there have been archaeological findings on the right on the right banks of Cologne .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; near the construction site for the new Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum have dug a skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , the Museum Director Marcus Trier will be on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the start of the construction work on the Rhine are hist@@ ori@@ ans searching for so @-@ called floor monuments .
for all building projects in the district of Cologne the museum will always be held as a specialist for archaeological excav@@ ations .
the ar@@ che@@ ologists were found in the third construction section of the Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ard .
from text documents had already been known that at the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century have been established a church . explained to Trier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strongh@@ old of the fortress , and the church tower was also a cemetery with around 350 tom@@ bs that belonged to the church . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 hrs the woman crossed the tracks towards the railway station , and was crossing a freight train coming from the direction of Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach in the direction of Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

EU Commission proposes the TTIP a new court in dispute
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the sharp@@ ening of the pursu@@ its about the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade Agreement , the EU Commission has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , the controversial private partnerships for disputes between the corpor@@ ations and states are to be replaced by a transparent system that corresponds to more traditional dishes in its function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that trust the citizens , &quot; explained the competent EU @-@ Commissioner Cecilia Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swe@@ de must introduce a proposal to the free trade talks to the US as a European negoti@@ ating position in the free trade talks .
the German government announced support .
TTIP will set up the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plans for the reform of current arbit@@ ration proceedings , in particular regard to the EU states and the United States , jointly select independent judges for a new investment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come from the EU and the United States and from third countries .
the second instance is for the first time .
it would allow it to rise up against urine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , the proce@@ eding involved with each other to the refer@@ ee , a m@@ g@@ ging option against their sentences did not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past months , it became clear that citizens are not entrusted with the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , commented on Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term she plans to work for an international investment court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , disputes between the Chinese companies and the EU states could be clari@@ fied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) primarily applies to TTIP by major companies in Europe against TTIP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the traditional arbit@@ ral tribunal will be cri@@ tici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel , over the enterprises can shift the tax@@ pay@@ ers to replace national laws or to reduce domestic and environmental standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first statements , Anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act designated the proposals by the European Commission as in@@ sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of all , it was cri@@ tici@@ zed above all trade agreements with Canada ( C@@ eta ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German state Secretary Matthias Mach@@ ina ( SPD ) marked the plans for a big progress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in spite of the reform significant points , the Commission &apos;s Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel worked out in the spring with other EU authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ral events is from the table .
the French government welcomed the plans by Malm@@ ström .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the business association of Busin@@ ess@@ Europe , the business association of Busin@@ ess@@ Europe was warned by too many new rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , small and medium @-@ sized businesses could dis@@ advant@@ aged , it was named . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the talks on the TTIP free trade agreements ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded on Wednesday .
negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
this issue has however not been discussed with the USA so far .
originally a frame for the agreement should be at the end of this year .
this date is regarded as no longer stored .
delicate Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ fi@@ jan Stev@@ ens are standing on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Luxor ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to him , a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy was recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with felt @-@ tip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire audience of about 40 people is almost seized by Stev@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of various places , he always tells the map how his min@@ u@@ zi@@ um and z@@ art arrange songs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
where they were created and how it looks like in his homeland .
since then Stev@@ ens has been mira@@ cul@@ ously creative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; seemed to be smart out very close to American folk in the late six@@ ties , but always into great opul@@ ent dri@@ fting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it arises the rum@@ ors of &quot; Michigan &quot; would be the first part of a temp@@ ted series : each of the 50 US states must be possessed in a row .
but already in 2004 and near the near of the Rhine the Seven Sw@@ ans already appeared and breaks positive expectations .
Stev@@ ens appears here .
live shows him guitar and ban@@ jo .
one year later the musician continues to live in New @-@ York @-@ based musicians .
&quot; Illinois Us ( &quot; Su@@ fi@@ jan Stev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) is released in 2005 a nationwide popular master@@ piece .
super@@ vis@@ ing ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in any of the most influ@@ ential music media in any year list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after extremely productive experiments , Stev@@ ens is operated on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic s@@ lat@@ tices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this sixth 2nd Studi@@ o@@ album is still wide orchest@@ rated , but carried by Programm@@ es or Be@@ ats and plays with all the effect and hall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
long ago the smaller clubs have gone up and shows the stage shows here for the colorful spectacle of Neon @-@ brow@@ n@@ bands and large fluorescent stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ z@@ jan Stev@@ ens performs as part of a five @-@ strong band through Germany .

he mainly presents the &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; since March .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although here almost 2,000 guests have been banned in its chairs , the prominent Stev@@ ens are returning to in@@ timacy and folk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without having a word to the audience , the group plays excellent musicians through the broad and enriched album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the audience one hears : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and you can certainly throw the &quot; plate . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only to an enc@@ ore , Stev@@ ens are modest and played more acou@@ stically with few older songs , and eventually draws on tos@@ sing appl@@ ause . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ &apos;s debut at the prime minister of the Prime Minister
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut has been eag@@ erly awa@@ ited by the prime minister of Prime Minister with sus@@ pic@@ ion since his election .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n should give his debut at the prime minister of prime minister , giving David Cameron for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to places the first of his six prescribed questions shortly after lunch , and their power is probably audi@@ ted by the media and the Labour voters near the area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for &quot; less theatres and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he has also said that he could skip a few sessions around her colleagues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , because she comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow ch@@ ops and following his speech at the Tu@@ c Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the Labour leader &apos;s decision on Tuesday during the Sin@@ cla@@ ir of the Battle of Britain will provo@@ ke still@@ ing criticism from a number of T@@ ory M@@ PS and stands at the centre of several cover pages @-@ Stories in the newspapers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ respon@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attention to her
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a comment by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said , &apos; he could have stood in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence and was recognized by the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n Sch@@ atten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his faith that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ y@@ ns &apos;s leading team , and they were all@@ ying in dis@@ agreements with the economy , defence and foreign affairs , while less than a six @-@ star of the Parliamentary Party had originally supported him as a guide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin bran@@ t says that political differences might be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statement on the position of the European Union and the barrier in winn@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the Tu@@ c Conference to make Labour to make the whole idea of a total limitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , Mr Smith , the Shadow Labour and R@@ ent Ministers said that the Party was &quot; very clear &quot; that only against the government plans to reduce the limit of £ 26@@ ,000 to 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron , since then he has T@@ ory boss , has over the dis@@ patch box in parliament last decade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour leader , who promised a different policy approach , says that he has given the crowd @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for Mr Cameron and given him more than 30.000 suggestions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the freight rate of the Prime Minister is con@@ front con@@ strained , and that he has taken hold on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic government is represented , if he does not participate - for example , Mr Cameron is traveling abroad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also brought the idea into a discussion that other colleagues can occasionally sei@@ ze the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the House , to discuss the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Cameron was a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he was involved in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theatre &quot; which often joined the Prime Minister &apos;s style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a few years later , he cleared that he failed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; having been broadcast on TV in 1990 , the wound with the Prime Minister became the most important Bar@@ ometer of the leader of a leader and his position under his par@@ liament@@ arians ; although critics have been argu@@ ed in a car@@ ic@@ ature and had no need for any problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

pounds rise by increased pay@@ roll growth in the UK
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Po@@ und increased further , on data , which indicate a rise in pay@@ roll growth of the United Kingdom . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the objective of SA@@ BM@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
between May and July the result of no bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9 % compared to the same period last year .
the percentage had been the fastest and experienced assessment over the time of an interest rate since 2009 .
the Po@@ unds rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1.@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the prominent share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after take @-@ on offer of the Rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and make brands like Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ d@@ sch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bur@@ berry shares were rewarded according to encouraging messages from the competition for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.0@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures suggest all expectations and showed the sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - growth again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares of G@@ LEN@@ COR@@ E rose 5 % , after the mining industry said that he took $ 2.5 billion by share sale as part of his strategy of debt reduction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the shares of the packaging and company debt MON@@ DI were the biggest los@@ ers in the index , with a decline of 4.3 % , after Gold@@ man Sachs &quot; sell his assessment for the company Rating on sale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % , after the sport @-@ bearing company reported an pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.6 million for the half @-@ year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages paid far at risk .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers may mean more buying power in the pockets of potential customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is unlikely that this buying power is compens@@ ated by the higher labour costs in his company , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean there are fewer jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

P@@ EG@@ IDA poster colle@@ cts the impression on potato d@@ eter &apos;s idea
potatoes or D@@ öner ?
it goes both - and while in the potato dum@@ b with the Ol@@ den@@ burger Fire owner Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y has developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the saying &quot; potato instead of D@@ öner &quot; on a poster of the P@@ EG@@ IDA movement , Al@@ ha@@ y potato and meat is put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster against a P@@ EG@@ IDA demonstration with the inscription &quot; potatoes instead of D@@ öner , &quot; which he had seen acci@@ dentally on TV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then comes a barbecue sk@@ ewer in its store that is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; that is multic@@ ul@@ tur@@ alism for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y .
the idea has meanwhile included the idea by giving birth to the Patent Office in Munich .
it has recently been protected as utility model according to the authority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a lot of meat and as much potatoes of the sk@@ ewer , Al@@ ha@@ y will not have betra@@ yed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as much : &quot; it tastes better when it tastes better . &quot;
even with his clients the culinary disp@@ osition is well received .
Met@@ cash launches Ground @-@ speed campaign to fight algae growth
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Met@@ abol@@ ism tried to protect the IGA branches in front of an Al@@ di advance in South Australia and Western Australia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
food @-@ wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ cash has launched a base @-@ speed campaign in order to defend the market share of the IGA re@@ ta@@ iler in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during Al@@ di , the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia have prepared their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand IGA through ma@@ instream marketing and marketing over social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ig@@ A &apos;s tra@@ ders and suppliers jump aboard , with brands such as ice manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough as distributed and shop @-@ owner , the banned tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash will be published further details of his defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment will be through its annual investments strategy on the day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is much in the game , since South Australia and Western Australia can make nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IGA store transactions and generate higher profit mar@@ gins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IGA network in the eastern states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; buyers in South Australia and Western Australia have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia , in comparison to around 14 percent in eastern Australia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , anal@@ ysts predi@@ ct Morgan Stanley that al@@ di twelve months after opening of his first markets round about five percent of the food market in these two states and sold all existing actors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a report published in this week , analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath by Morgan Stanley appreciated the IGA re@@ ta@@ iler of 360 $ million revenue per year and met@@ cash $ 250 million may lose by the end of 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this progn@@ osis is based on the assum@@ ption , that Al@@ di opened 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA and generated sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the loss in food and grocery store , and in the amounts on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost could cost met@@ cash around 13 million US profit before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , Met@@ abol@@ ished market share in eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan had found that IGA buyers are the most loyal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Morgan Stanley particip@@ ates in the food and grocery store by 3.8 percent in 2016 and 2.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in the year 2018 it will reduce its market share of 14 percent by 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , was the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , which will probably be cash within a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Met@@ cash refused to publicly react to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is assumed that a member of the executive board of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass took up last week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
IG@@ O &apos;s market share has fallen by 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food stores which roughly assumed an operating debt reduction in turnover and mar@@ gins in 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the wholes@@ al@@ ers imp@@ acted and inv@@ ests more than 150 million in order to improve sales prices with Col@@ es and wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ds@@ men at improving their shops by rapidly growing fresh foods and provide better variety of private label food products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s chief executive director Ian Mor@@ rice says , that the price adjustment and loading programs are to be re@@ designed for the first time in 2017 to return to profit growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis Association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves more praise to be criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; collapse damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Cy@@ gios and deserves more praise as criticism for his own behavior .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger talented du@@ os who is often referred to as &quot; Special KS , &quot; by the not@@ orious conflict of Cy@@ ril with St@@ an WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA with the Montreal Masters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a fier@@ y qualifying play in Cincinnati soon , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to strike by the arbit@@ rators , and Har@@ rison had to strike Cy@@ rin , and I should strike the child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he has seen a tennis ra@@ cket , as he fired a tennis ra@@ cket , having fired a potential US Open victory of Richard gas@@ quet , co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single area of Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ finals against Great Britain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing about which I was quite en@@ ei@@ ving , is the fact that After my view Th@@ an@@ asi was a little inside the dispute , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was broken up as he lost a ra@@ cket for the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken up a bat with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi , to know that he is not proud of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , really , he has kept himself in the US Open extremely well , even under the quite pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deser@@ ved a lot of recognition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too strictly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits in the changing field , he is doing well in form , it is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deser@@ ved to be judged by his own serving . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly also did not support the decision , Cy@@ gios are not taking into account when it begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; to return to the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition , and not all the contro@@ vers@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I think he made the Ascension of how Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray took him . he asc@@ ends to the eyes of the public and he only try to think him that he can only think about it , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains Not@@ ice : closing the border continues to hold refugees
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary explains the emergency room and enc@@ amped the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday , holding all those attemp@@ ted to stop illegal in the country . everything with the goal to stop the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chaos followed at the border , as hundreds of migrants responded to a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and responded to the Serbian officials with anger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who had fled from violence in a country strip on the road between the two control points of the countries , and built tents and settled there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but terms of breakfast rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter above them , the migrants &quot; Op@@ ens the limit ! &quot; and sm@@ ells war@@ fare against Hungarian policies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were back from protest foods and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ser@@ bi@@ ens Foreign Minister explained that it was &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be returned , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece will arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ision case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days , discussions with Brussels and other countries will be held , &quot; said Iv@@ ica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serb border came on a day after the 28 @-@ Nations blo@@ c at a deb@@ ating meeting in Brussels , no joint immigration policy could be agreed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who had sought refuge for the next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would include more than 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit in the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
Hungary has not set its hopes to an im@@ min@@ ent action from Brussels or its neigh@@ bors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , the emergency stand on Tuesday gave more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they have locked up roads and able to speed asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also will plan the construction of a bar@@ bed wire , in order to stop the influ@@ x of migrants in order to stop a fence at the Serbian border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BS News Cor@@ respon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prisoners of race in the race that were used to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few months , Hungary has become a considerable point of war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to a significant tariff and the point of entry into the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , prime minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most likely economic refugees are in search of a better life and not war refugees that have contra@@ diction to other EU countries , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new laws which entered into force at midnight , making the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high Z@@ a@@ uns by laying the government along the southern border to Serbia , also laying down higher pen@@ alties for convicted traff@@ ick@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation arising from the mass migration , the Hungarian Government declar@@ es emergency condition , &quot; spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern town of Sz@@ eged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament must not yet agree on the use of the military nor vote for next week , but Rep@@ orter of Associated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs at day@@ time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , Landes Security Ad@@ visor for Or@@ ban , said that authorities have 45 people attemp@@ ting to cross the border , 15 others were already deep into the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they come over by using the fence , they are now being accused of custody and are accused of off@@ ense after the new laws . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
authorities are there to quickly repair the fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday morning , Hungarian officials closed two of the seven border cros@@ sings with Serbia , having to close the borders with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chaos re@@ comp@@ assed the main Gren@@ zen@@ ge near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and squee@@ ze a crowd in order to put yourself there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some 20 succeeded in stri@@ ving but thousands remain outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that she would leave food and water until they travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s ledge outside of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in the national survey
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton is still holding a second @-@ digit margin in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins across the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton has now claimed the support of 47 percent of democratic voters during elections ( 58 per cent earlier ) , while S@@ anders is at second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vice President Joe Bi@@ den who has not announced yet if he is candidate for the Presi@@ dential Office and receives support for 15 percent of the democratic voters of the election .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than five months before the start of the election , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is fixed to what candidates will assist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Clin@@ tons Supp@@ orters are present in her election as those of the other candidates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey , Clinton has lost some of the prizes in a number of demo@@ graphic groups while S@@ BS achieved some winn@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton is holding a big advantage in women and re@@ strained , but these jumps have decreased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their support in the men has significantly dropped , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clin@@ tons is crucial for democratic voters under the age of 50 , and they are now on the same height . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton is still a big advantage over the older voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit advantage at the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about half of the democratic voters of the country would say that they would support Clinton , if they were nominated by the party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a quarter would support them with some reservations , and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the can@@ did@@ ac@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters is particularly fond of it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the views are stronger with those that are currently not supported by Clinton , only about a quarter would enthusias@@ tically support them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while 48 percent of the democratic voters say that they can support Clinton with enthusiasm , say less rep@@ ubli@@ can voters turn this over its top candidate with Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Clin@@ tons supports her in an open question , why they want that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the fact that a woman is present ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Clinton &apos;s supporters , her connection with Bill Clinton is also mentioned ( 9 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
approval to deal with problems and voters will also be quoted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the vice @-@ president throws an potential for the presidential office , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - even though a third believ@@ ing he should not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if democratic voters were asked to call the election , who would be the second choice for the party , is Bi@@ den at the top . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Clinton &apos;s followers more than half , that Bi@@ den would be the second choice far from being different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Bi@@ den decides not to can@@ de the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead increases his lead , 20 points with bi@@ den in running at 30 points without him in the race . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fifteen percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a can@@ did@@ ac@@ tin with the best chances to win the election , but this figure has fallen by 78 percent over the last month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den has increased by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; choice &quot; is risen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , in the question of what is more important for a candidate , the Democratic voters call on the voters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar to the last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for this voters turn out to be un@@ acceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Democratic candidate or potential candidates produce good results with some important tra@@ its in the elections of their party &apos;s elections .
Clinton , Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den are hon@@ estly and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den cuts the guidance of three candidates , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thirty per cent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton &apos;s honest and trust@@ worthy is twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) but 27 percent do not have any opinion about him .
Democratic voters of the elections in general also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
all these measurements has no opinion of S@@ anders for all these data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server , most Democratic voters of the election are still satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s a different story in the American public .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half of the Americans is un@@ happy with their explanation , while only about a third is satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the public opinion of this was in March , shortly after the problem came into the light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most Americans said that the E @-@ Mail Contro@@ vers@@ y had no effect on the general opinions of Clinton , though 36 percent said that their opinion of her was still worse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mostly rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 , they say that their views of Clinton become worse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Clinton is regarded by the voters of their party as honest and trusted , this is still a problem for them under registered voters . only 32 percent see it as honest and trusted , eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less since May . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
62 percent of voters do not hold them for hon@@ our@@ able and trusted person .
at the same time 55 percent of voters suff@@ ers far as well and not trust@@ worthy and not trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump also receive good marks on leadership .
we cut Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush to best of hon@@ esty from the six tested candidates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a majority looks rather than honest , but as at Car@@ son many have no opinion of him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 &apos;s Democratic voters at the pres@@ election amounts to 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son approaches national survey close behind Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times densely behind Donald Tr@@ ump
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by now , half the support of voters falls into the new pol@@ l , and others fall dramatically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rep@@ ubli@@ can voters carry nationwide Tr@@ ump in large numbers . the support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey which was conducted before the Fox News debate in the past month up to 27 % in the survey .
but Car@@ son enjoyed the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
in the survey the survey found that Car@@ son exceeds well and over@@ l@@ ump in rep@@ ubli@@ can voters with university education .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the field , except Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Governor John Ka@@ det , has dropped with Wis@@ con@@ sins Governor Scott Walker , who fell in deepest walks with 10 % support in the last month to now 2 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; former Florida Governor J@@ eb Bush , former Governor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are at the third place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the error mar@@ gins at the sample sample of 3@@ 76 people from Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son asc@@ ends to the p@@ olls - he ends with 19 % support in the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the latest development of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump against Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a look at one last week &apos;s rising Car@@ son , Tr@@ ump found some side hi@@ th@@ iev@@ es for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son acknowledged his ref@@ ills to question tr@@ umps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we need energy &quot; last Saturday Tr@@ ump said in I@@ owa last Saturday .
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough to find even hot water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some are not going into the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mediterranean temperatures still offers the Mediterranean : it even comes up to 29 degrees in the east .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Adriatic sea , there are 25 degrees in top and 23 degrees in France . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a Bar@@ uch College Ne@@ ul@@ ings
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost two years after a student during a sham@@ an@@ ous ritual purpose , a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , M@@ ord@@ an accused against five people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; members of New York Bar@@ uch College Pi @-@ delta @-@ delta @-@ br@@ otherhood between Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g was brut@@ ally attacked and delayed their transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , the police shared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; officers said , he had been charged with connected eyes with a 30 pound backpack full of sand , and tried to attack while trying to go over a frozen field to a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches and then he fell un@@ conscious .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the members of the Pi @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after den@@ g , and waited for an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ i &apos;s clothing , to contact his symptoms to contact counsel , said politi@@ cian Chris Wagner on a press conference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , members began to hide themselves and made the good of the br@@ otherhood more than that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; he said Poli@@ sti@@ ef Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved and he died on his injuries next morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g repeated his injuries to the head , body and th@@ igh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too many families were destroyed by the Sh@@ ik@@ anas of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies every year since 1970 , Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , who represents the D@@ eng@@ i family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held to account , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended a indictment for murder on the third floor for the first five members .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of sham@@ an@@ ous attacks and formation of a criminal association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the participating persons , but if there is an organization which will be officially or officially - this will also be a meeting point , &quot; says Wagner on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an interest rate comes , and the hou@@ sings come into the s@@ way , returns to bonds , and the economy will lead into recession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take all , and how long it will stop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the history of the economy is in particular only a small guide to the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recession came from within 11 months after the first rate of interest , and lasted for 86 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising the interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in the economy and finance industries react . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank said so viol@@ ently that investors should not focus on increasing interest rates , but rather than the period which is needed for norm@@ alisation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several variables play a role in fact .
but in the end market participants could determine that the whole excitement could be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated because of a rate of interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inev@@ it@@ ably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the &quot; cheap money &quot; era , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a Communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , we don &apos;t expect the gradu@@ al return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to be able to fear many . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that does not mean there will be no effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a view of historic trends , based on how several areas of the economy might react : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as seen on the market last month , inser@@ tion of interest rate things can make things for a while . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as soon as the increase occurs , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is apparently a tendency to down@@ turn back profits from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , &quot; said German bank anal@@ ysts in a recent study regarding the rate of interest in the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely the market in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to the rate of income - about 14 percent - on the way to the rate of interest ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) and then back to normal conditions that Bob D@@ oll , head plant @-@ Strat@@ chers at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management in Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares ten@@ ders occur later , and the return is beginning to decrease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life but interest rate changes it often .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confron@@ ted with some conditions which had not existed before and that a recession could accelerate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is notable that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point at an interest rate of the F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Deutsche Bank , 118 ts@@ an@@ ists since 1950 decreased only twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few showed that this will last and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest rate in a so frag@@ ile economic back@@ drop might be ris@@ ky and take the question , &quot; whether this is different , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; market participants have taken the whole year to an interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the Federal Open Market Committee in this week which ends on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC may find an increase in this meeting , the fut@@ ures trade show just an probability of 25 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all increases of increases from 1950 to today in a super cycle with increasing momentum in the GDP took place and before rec@@ eding before recovery in the shadows , &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current cycle is by far the longest one has waited since the last recession since the end of the last recession , and this has been 74 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market takes a interest rate and the pattern is rather similar to the capital market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than on shares , when they change their strategic course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in bonds , they seem to change their direction , as soon as the first increase / lowering in the cycle occurs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of the raising cycle the service charges apply immediately and said the Deutsche Bank .
the strateg@@ ist of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will result in the increase between length@@ ier and shorter bonds and lead to a short@@ cut curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly @-@ consuming bonds are often bringing better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious , higher yields can be expected , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come Analy@@ zer at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest@@ ingly Jones , Jones , the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed Strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the sever@@ ity of the dollar and the decline of inflation , there are a few indications that the market has adapted to the prosp@@ ect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; short term interest rates have risen , the yield is fl@@ atter , bor@@ dering has increased and the volume has increased - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed has shar@@ pen@@ ed its strategy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; throughout the large and entire company , companies will refuse to un@@ cover the larger part of their business activities in the US , as interest rates are rising and local products will get more attractive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multin@@ ational companies with high debts are worse , as an increasing amount of its products will be more expensive on the global market and the financing of their debts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares ten@@ ds to react positively , three months after an initial interest rate , Gold@@ man Sachs @-@ anal@@ ysts said in one report for customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed companies with low balance sheet according to each of the interest rate in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 aver@@ aged by 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital gains and low volati@@ lity at their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality at an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts become a major problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest will most lose the best at Gold@@ man said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; outside of pure share games , consumers will also benefit from the rising costs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; savers want to see gains through higher yields , even if experts of different opinion are to be done quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM of the member &quot; Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
conservative member of the Parliament cri@@ tici@@ zed the sender for its &quot; stup@@ idity &quot;
it argu@@ ed that he is not differenti@@ ated from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also referred to the BBC Music Awards and said that they im@@ ited only The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins handle the voice The Voice Mail , saying that this is not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 , &quot; convert &quot; to Classic FM , claims a leading Parliament member and increases new pressure on the transm@@ it@@ ters to prove that he does not do something in the public broad@@ caster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew B@@ ingham , the s@@ qui@@ ties Andrew B@@ ingham , also said to the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen , that the public @-@ legal radio station is not to be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; distor@@ ted &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM ; &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also played the BBC Music Awards , which began last December . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under a different name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples where you only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BBC @-@ Colonel General showed the accus@@ ations back and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 lie far ahead of his commercial con@@ ten@@ ders , when it comes to public and en@@ lighten@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I learn from Radio 3 learn I will learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that really is un@@ matched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 , finding new music and to give new works in order , I also really think so important , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Dav@@ ey argu@@ ed that harder to engage in the audience , as it did in the past because the Br@@ its are less informed of classical music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production , which during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sports under fire , the commercial ri@@ vals on their feet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins The Voice on - the musical talent show of the BBC , bought from the Dutch producer T@@ ill@@ a Media for estimated costs of 22 million £ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you see why this program is often deb@@ ated because it isn &apos;t original and is not particularly striking ?

Internet sales rose in August at slow@@ est and Black Friday can be responsible for this
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month there was the lowest result since the start of the record in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to purchase
experts believe that the Black Friday in November has slow@@ ed down the expenses
for over a decade the virtual shopping is drilled and many of the main shopping streets of Britain have changed in gh@@ ost cities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yet experts say that there are evidence that online sales have st@@ agn@@ ated , after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the total expenditure for August represent the lowest increase in growth since the start of record in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts say that there are indications that online sales st@@ agn@@ ate , after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look back the growth rates for the previous years and till 2000 , Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sale de@@ xes of the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained that online sales advanced three years ago , when buyers managed to buy purchases on their mobile phones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments such as at home on the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now , it sw@@ ings , and we will be able to experience the growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , imported from America , is cited as a reason for signing numbers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts believe that buyers will keep their purchases in front of this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers for their computers in order to make their bar@@ gain , and some tra@@ der websites dis@@ continued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts believe that Black Friday , on which the buyer will fight for bar@@ gains , buyers could stop shopping purchases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a study of British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium found that £ 5 spending was spent more than £ 1@@ £ online .
some products such as TV and washing machines are now accomplished more than one @-@ third of the purchases over web stores .
at the same time more than a quarter of man clothes bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online than in the mode@@ ms in the city centers .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca on the Crane accident killed in Mec@@ ca - Bin Laden &apos;s family will be sanc@@ tioned
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 victims are carried by Muslims at the first fun@@ eral events in Mec@@ ca , through the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Saudi Arabia reli@@ eves the collapse in part of the giant Saudi Bin Laden group to the load
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane was r@@ ushed
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hundreds of Muslims , when 29 of the victims were gathered around the streets to bury the deaths that were killed , as a crane called to Mec@@ ca Gross@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trau@@ matic , largely dressed in white , dressed in white for their respect , when the first of the dead members appeared their last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ a@@ Sen@@ m cemetery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fun@@ eral pro@@ cession went over in the Holy Site , where only days before a building crane pushed through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the crashed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bodies were approved for the fun@@ eral , when the Saudi King released over the construction company of the family bin Laden for the catastrophe which also left 3@@ 94 injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 suffer@@ ers who were killed , when a crane was thrown by the Great Central mosque Mek@@ kas , were carried by the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Gre@@ ater Manchester , father of four children , was on his first pilgrimage as the crane under@@ lining . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was at the Great Mos@@ que in front of his parents at the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Saudi officials have already confirmed that the p@@ addle to Mec@@ ca , which will continue to come to the city , will continue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden group did not stop the arm of the crane as he was not used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Arabic version of the decree issued by the state Saudi press Agency , said that the Bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English language service of the news agency informed this detail not only said that the management of the company abroad must be banned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man created the fall of the crane that crashed into a courtyard of the grand@@ mo@@ z@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims took place before the H@@ add@@ sch , who later gathered in this month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bin Laden group did not have issued any statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representative were not available for a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Royal Dec@@ ree did not support the group because of its current security measures , because it has not worked with meteor@@ ologists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dozens of cranes are surrounded by crow@@ ds to Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mo@@ z@@ ee as part of the massive building project that is led by Bin Laden group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for decades , the Bin Laden family has been associated with the rulers of Saudi Arabia and assumes no major projects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the late leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was an abor@@ tion son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in 1990 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crash of the crane was in the midst of heavy winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which at least once in the life of any healthy dest@@ iny is required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
civil servants said that 158 people remain in hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; government officials count that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to relatives are to be paid and the same sum of permanently injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other publishers get half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap East European craftsmen is over
Brit@@ ons employ more people and says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified workers from Eastern Europe has rise behind
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this leads to a 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which aim to aim for tra@@ des@@ people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q outlet points nationwide
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City chief correspon@@ dent in the Daily Mail
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is said that British will perform their h@@ amm@@ ers and brush in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European arti@@ sans who perform their work in their home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you can deal with a hammer or a brush to paint walls , these are apparently the minority to a minority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Britain employ more people to carry home@@ use jobs in their homes so the leader of the company behind B &amp; Q .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ é@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new CEO of King@@ fis@@ her , who has the hom@@ ec@@ enters chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe , which offer services to low@@ ly prices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 other screens shops which focus on craftsmen and close to 60 sales outlets from B &amp; Q . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said , she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q @-@ shops , because eight of ten purchase decisions in the shop are taken by women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the moment the men weigh over men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said that it is necessary to provide the growing demo@@ graphic trends , which have more feminine single @-@ households to carry more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we must move this stronger towards a balance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically , half of our clients consist of women with 80 per cent of the decisions concerning the purchase of articles by women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
women play a major role in decision @-@ making process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is listed by only five women at the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index listed leading companies to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company , which has occupied just 50 percent of the team with women , including the Board of Management and Financial Officer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; King@@ Fis@@ her reported a drop in half @-@ year profit and sales , after the group accounts for closing the shops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the current trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q has opened up to 200 new stores . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
functions of A@@ ich / D@@ Is due to non@@ compliance before court
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday , Kl@@ agen@@ furt am Regional Court acquitted on Wednesday , two officials of the Austrian volleyball editor A@@ I / D@@ ob . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the def@@ endants pleaded not guilty .
one of them was also accused of minist@@ iss@@ ants .
he was acquitted of this court in May .
the current process was post@@ pon@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the pro@@ secutor of Robert Ri@@ ffel , Robert Ri@@ ffel pro@@ sec@@ uted herself in the preliminary analysis that the accused were allowed to disp@@ ose of club accounts in 2006 to 2011 for private purposes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the damage is handled with around 400@@ ,000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Sports functionality are also charged for financial markets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fact retired the chairman of the open sheet , by Judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the dis@@ continuation of the un@@ faithful , the defence appe@@ aled that the association could not be taken into an asset . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sports@@ men would have been able only for allowance and have invested a lot of time and money for whom they have invested a lot of time and money , in 2001 , around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ illings ( approx . 44@@ .000 Euros ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; at that time we stood still ahead of the situation : do we continue to lock the club or do we lock ? &quot; he told one of the accused and a professional bul@@ let on the store .
with his colleagues and co @-@ accused he decided to take over this task .
with all the risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have with@@ ered money , guarant@@ e@@ eing our life insurance as safety at the bank , &quot; he said during the capture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unless agreed with the association , you may freely manage the money , no debts can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the corresponding financial - success the withdrawal of the insur@@ rection had decided retro@@ active until 1991 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , one part of the allowance damage was only years later , that from 2003 , when a plus would have been on the account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Ob@@ mann also seemed to be described as previously named packages and not detail switches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accounts and savings count under the two def@@ endants , said the second accused . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why the withdraw@@ als of the association did not appear in detail , the judge asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association was not interested in detail in financial matters , it was only important to the debt of school so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when in 2011 , against the function@@ ary investigations for ministers , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was the def@@ endant they declared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to his testimony , this securities account ran on behalf of the second accused and was not known according to the association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; I wanted to know the judge .
he didn &apos;t know the answer for a long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he believed that this was the best for the Society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if something happened to him , nobody would have had anything about this money , he made public pro@@ secutor in the space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the co @-@ accused had been informed and the functioning of the function .
this refer@@ ral was formulated as a &quot; compensation . &quot;
why Cla@@ im compensation ? to know judge and pro@@ secutor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first def@@ endant explained that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association did never have incurred a damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what shall I do when the lawyer says : &quot; by whom you are all from the Schneider . &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; he asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; additionally the function@@ ary said , he never referred to a cent salary , and sold only mil@@ eage and di@@ ets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on di@@ ets , he charged the club 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort was however much higher , added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accurate documents for the early years were not able to indicate the def@@ endants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these be said after a operation , in which anything was judged correctly , not been kept , declared them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the second staff had also referred to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all accommodation is in cash , in addition to that he must lead the home of international home to the Bank for lead to lead in his testimony . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main trial will be on 23rd of September with the survey of witnesses .

behind it a police line had formed and behind the polic@@ eman stood up a water@@ row@@ er .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones and plastic bottles to the official officials .
the officials initially put continuous pepper spray .
afterwards the police used Tr@@ än@@ n@@ as .
much tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
the Group was thus dis@@ b@@ anded .
the refugees have now with@@ drawn something .
a pregnant and obviously injured woman was run away from the zone .
children who had met the tear gas had been scre@@ aming .
other refugees involved in themselves and suffered under respiratory action .

time of decision on interest rates for the US emergency bank
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world is observed when the US emergency bank come together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest will be lifted or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a survey conducted under 80 econom@@ ists that were sur@@ vey@@ ed by Reuters , found that the F@@ ed will last more than half , now thinks that the F@@ ed will wait no longer and keep interest rates on the current stand of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a historical event because it &apos;s seven years ago , since the F@@ ed interest rates on NU@@ LL . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a large central bank will leave the zero @-@ area and a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , leader at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US economy is at a relatively good performance , trillion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low level of inflation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less st@@ ony view on global circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has warned the markets to adapt to an increase , but the signs indicate that the signs against one such step are good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after killing and killing his friend in Mississi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he wanted to kill his colleagues on Monday morning , and wrote Sh@@ annon Lamb . &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; announced the authorities on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police at Gau@@ tier , Mississi@@ ppi , said that Lamb is calling for geography and social science education at Delta State University , calling the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , I have shot and killed on someone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb told the staff of the emergency call that police officers had to send a police home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; I enjoyed my wife yesterday evening &quot; and he also mentioned a &quot; cute dog &quot; in the house that nobody can upset him , but probably excited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police answered the c@@ aller for his name , but he didn &apos;t give him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb made no explanation for his shots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the police looked at the scene , they found the body of Amy P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice of Lamb , 45 , who said , &quot; I am sorry , I could und@@ o it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after writing the Noti@@ z , Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , killing his own life on Monday evening when police arrested him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge told , he didn &apos;t know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb allegedly believed that P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt on Tuesday , there is no further information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said they had been married for about seven years , as a &quot; good man &quot; described . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago and made friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss would have been a daughter who is 19 and it was destroyed in the ground .
he said that P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss was her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss worked online from home , according to statement by Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Know@@ les said that P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ss that had been a dog called Light@@ ning had existed for about three years with Lamb .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people &quot; said Know@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , I called at a certain time on Monday to say to them , &quot; he will not go into prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when police arrived on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville , on Highway 1 , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest , killing itself with a shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in spring 2015 Lamb came from the Delta State University to a Ph.@@ D. , like his life in Wroc@@ law on the University &apos;s website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
stars who lost their lucky charm
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had a few st@@ ress@@ ful years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner in Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the actor also allegedly fought with drugs , and in 2008 he was convicted of off@@ ences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all this demands for sure its tribute .

Luke Sha@@ w by Manchester United can &apos;t play for months due to double fac@@ ture
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the Champions League defeat of Manchester , Luke Sha@@ w was experiencing a double fac@@ ture of his right one in Eindhoven . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while leaving the left outside def@@ ending , Louis van Ga@@ al won &apos;t give the hope that Sha@@ w can play this season back again for at least six months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the injury was caused by a hop@@ eless attack by H@@ é@@ ctor Mor@@ eno during the 15th minute , after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was inserted into the PS@@ V area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was treated nine minutes on the field , and required oxygen before being taken to the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double sur@@ ture and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will be transferred tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then I had surgery in Manchester .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then takes place to be fantastic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double error , then it takes six months and will not play in the group phase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be a red card and the hanging of a mo@@ meter .
Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee and did not pun@@ ish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al susp@@ ects that the Italian refer@@ ee had been mistaken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can judge for yourself when I say , that a sl@@ meter and a red card were due . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told you about Sha@@ ws account : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can &apos;t describe how broken I am , my way to recovery is now , I come back again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here : Manchester United the loss of Luke Sha@@ w suffering from the defeat at PS@@ V
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the European Championship in France , the England defender in France has an additional incen@@ tive to recover from the upcoming June . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Phillip Bo@@ u is the PS@@ V coach , said : &quot; it is a very simple violation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a player with this kind of injury left the place , all are very sad about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is never the intention of our player to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al &apos;s Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to harm the opponent , and if you hear that it is a very simple violation , this is not good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only thing I could see was the ball that was on the way in another direction , so that it had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels like , I know how difficult it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry about it .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought into the hospital - after a oul@@ dering by Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child love a book , it will not be long until you know it almost . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he was requested by a supplier of child@@ care systems , his favorite child &apos;s book decided to call The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a tough election , Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company Super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s always a book or a message that we have missed so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all well and well , apart from the following paragraph , in which Cameron describes the plot of the book , instead the new characters and details added to expand the new characters and details to enlarge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am@@ id@@ st the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone , a boy named after the girl of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of Au@@ dre@@ y , met her own name Theodor Se@@ uss Geis@@ el , who died in 1991 but was completely unknown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if it is still not a susp@@ ect enough : the text of David &apos;s movie database is partly reads like the synthesis of the movie database that is arti@@ f@@ ici@@ ally and even the air a commodity is hoping to win a boy named Ted and the girl of Au@@ dre@@ y to win the girl of his dreams .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although he agre@@ es to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron seems to be un@@ familiar with the protests of the ornam@@ ent Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , car@@ ving creatures which will be destroyed in the name of the trees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per deleg@@ ated The Lor@@ ax does not read 20 times in a row . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a Down@@ ing Street speaker spoke that the text was likely to be passed by Mr Cameron &apos;s election cycle .
Super@@ camps confirmed that the text by Cameron &apos;s employees was delivered ; but there was no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team but it is still difficult
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , a difficult task is to be found , but if you select the Ka@@ der that England is chosen for the tour , there is a repeti@@ tion of the 3 @-@ 0 test series failed on my map . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I would not take a down@@ ward victory .
A@@ last@@ air Coo@@ ks &apos;s site may be less experienced than the three years ago but there are good spin players in the battle template and the joint spirit is strong ; they will not wear s@@ cars of 2012 only a you@@ thful positive attitude .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as a spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on test plane , is an option for the attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this related news : Adam Ly@@ th is reli@@ eved from the England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der , and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , for me as his head trainer in York@@ shire , difficult to analyze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its seven test , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ ck@@ et@@ eers are al@@ igned with results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were no question marks at Joe root , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination , da - and I told this - players are their own best selection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a long time ago , one would have extended the run of Ly@@ res , but he had control over his own dest@@ iny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he hopefully beat further runs for York@@ shire , another chance will come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his post@@ ure , even if he did not give so good performances and that surprises me ; he is especially a team man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question , how much time does a test pun@@ cher receive , in order to set his character is difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ly@@ th won seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - who received Nick Comp@@ ton nine .
only Comp@@ ton &apos;s chance to play home and act .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only accus@@ ation that one can lift was that England was first put to Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean , but that lost chance is now in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he is a drummer that I treasure high .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is an X @-@ factor Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ tist , which we saw at York@@ shire early in this season , when he achieved 2nd place with us on a Tr@@ ent bridge , what very met us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has to receive at least the same chances like those before him , but naturally it depends on the team study in the United Arab Emirates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea , Mo@@ een in addition to Cook , get to get an extra spin Bow@@ ler and get four Qu@@ icks off and I found nothing against it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a head@@ man can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed is already shown that he &apos;s a char@@ med player from Cri@@ cket players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mo@@ een may not get his job done for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is there a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my former team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before joining a op@@ ener in 2001 .
he immediately got three hundred edges and did not look back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ s@@ Ans@@ ari comes in the ca@@ der as a back @-@ up sk@@ inner , and in my limited dealing with him he has impressed me as a young man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people may see their statistics at an average age 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it is a Pun@@ ching , but there is no large number of backup sk@@ inn@@ ers who raise their hands and the train@@ ers have op@@ ted for youth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team England has made a few clever additions at the trainees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ es , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game , who will bring an abundance of experience since it has played under all conditions and against all the attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes into the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use in the setup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always felt that he was created for the international Cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights which we can benefit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes new voices in the locker room can bring fresh wind , even if the news in tune with the previously ch@@ anting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Coll@@ dy team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , will not be used for the One @-@ Day@@ ers , and got a similar break against Australia and I for my part have no problem with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some will not agree on but coaches and team actors do not set the timet@@ able .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you have to think about the players depend on their jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
such decisions are not taken lightly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bre@@ xit ( Bre@@ xit ( UK &apos;s accession to the EU ) could win at Zul@@ u , when the economy starts in a F@@ lau@@ te until 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; David Mr Cameron &apos;s un@@ published re@@ union strategy to hold Britain in the EU with every day , even without the choice of the great Jerem@@ y &quot; Is Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n became the leader of Labour or Tu@@ c who was fighting very heavily on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
foreigners also have their cor@@ n@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a European diplom@@ at said that some member states , so deeply ent@@ angled in various crises , like the EU now is and not always from its own debt , Britain itself , which they are usually not want to be satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Brighton , the Tu@@ c decided at its annual meeting that it does not like the social protection at risk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prime Minister and Finance Ministers climb up meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local measurements , come home and say that they allies support for reforms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is all about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend , who wishes looking for a great Britain inside the EU @-@ tent - &quot; L@@ ass is not alone with France , &quot; says that more and more short @-@ sight@@ ful ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is a allies who has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it is bad for its ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) in Mitter@@ rand ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande looks for his re @-@ election or its en@@ forcement in 2017 .
he is also an anti @-@ aband@@ on@@ ment .
Poland perhaps soon has a nation@@ alistic right government in Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to imagine that they should plu@@ ck up a leg in order to prevent the Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Br@@ its , whose energy should not want to be better off from the UK , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ cally ten@@ dencies have . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , some such ministers will even plan yet non @-@ helpful notes , quite in the SN@@ P style in order to speed up the Bre@@ xit process , susp@@ ects my friend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the new negoti@@ ation was a ple@@ ite &quot; and &quot; Britain won &apos;t win anything from the new tre@@ ati@@ se . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europeans know how although Fle@@ et Street can be on its cost , and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press bar@@ ons as it did not support our entry into 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you may remember Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ Euro Opport@@ uni@@ sten , who made a name as a &quot; EU Ger@@ ade banana &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at all his ru@@ d@@ iness Ed Mili@@ band knew who they were of his enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this purpose , the Med@@ ley belonged to the tax @-@ fear@@ ing sh@@ anks , telephone ch@@ opping ob@@ s@@ ali@@ ens and p@@ seudo @-@ non @-@ domestic countries that have most of our big newspapers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually , Tony Bla@@ ir said about her , but she discovered that if you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , to di@@ stra@@ ct him instead of being able to get rid of his lunch and dinner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ iri@@ sts as Bla@@ ir itself , because Bla@@ ir was rejected by the EU &apos;s referendum , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the press has never forgiven him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the cute Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly cla@@ p on Monday in Westminster , on Monday , he seemed to repeat that no time would repeat for me no time , N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cott Mur@@ al , a mistake back then and now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may take time but he must develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but surely with Andrew Mar@@ r , the BBC sofa he left on Sunday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is - I &apos;ll put it in a friendly way - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps of traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ ale tendency and the wild fav@@ ors of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can probably say Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and TV this week , as the boy sc@@ outs acted as the appo@@ inting John Mc@@ McDon@@ nell up a bad idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it remin@@ ded me about the 70 &apos;s , when his old father began to sit on television to his Labour Cab@@ inet fellow , without going too far and lose his cabin job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys struggle was still more attractive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but to fight for &quot; under all circumstances - Benn@@ s express - was not what McDon@@ nell said , what J@@ C told his comra@@ des and dep@@ u@@ ties to all reports on Monday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whatever the touching Bot@@ tom @-@ Up image from Cor@@ by@@ n , remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the stru@@ del of Social Media , a breeding place of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ y@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is correct to give Cameron to provide no free ticket for Europe , to keep label support in the speech campaign for a self @-@ hen@@ sibility , like McDon@@ nell said it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins think so safe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but McDon@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental am@@ big@@ u@@ ity to EU membership , with its anti @-@ capitalist past - is not just a question of discuss@@ ing dog@@ matic disputes being a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like with its big@@ uous things to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son , the J@@ C will not be committed to leaving foreign diplom@@ ats , trying to find a sense of their own home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why should Paris or Berlin get political capital , they also have mis@@ erable poll@@ ing - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if all this can be meaning@@ less ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the U.S. is already rather disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government which was remin@@ ded of something that was called British Influ@@ ence Security Forum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Experts critic@@ ise the report by Public Health England on E @-@ cigarettes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigarettes have been less harmful as smoking , from a meeting of 12 persons , some with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts that write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , L@@ anc@@ et closed them to critic@@ ise the evidence of the Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in her report on e @-@ cigarettes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ he published the &quot; Basic Stat@@ ements &quot; in the past month and describes it as a comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but some researchers have ques@@ tioned the lo@@ ad@@ ability of the data , and referred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Editorial in the medical journal L@@ anc@@ et last month , the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily wind@@ y foundation , &quot; which he justified his principal conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two more researchers have called in BM@@ J and asked if the claims are based on stone or sand . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor for European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor for Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health should be based on the proof of effectiveness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the public is expected that &quot; the current best estim@@ ation is that e @-@ cigarettes is about 95 % less harmful to smoking , based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , this statement from a single session of 12 people , which were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multi @-@ quality criteria ( multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to implement their opinions on the damage of various nic@@ otine @-@ containing products . the results of the meeting were presented in a research report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting named Euro@@ bonds , whose managing director was held by British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also signed the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the 12 participants stated to meet the funding from an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not the funding they have received before the tobacco company Philip Morris International , they added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reasons for the selection of the members of the committee are not delivered , but includes several known E @-@ cigarettes champ@@ ions , some of which also include economic finance in the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some other participants in this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting the tobacco administration of P@@ he took part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the group &apos;s research work suggests that there is a lack of &quot; tough evidence for the damages of most products in most criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however no such connections or restrictions is discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes have been used as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he said that on the claims of BM@@ J already had responded before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigarettes is significantly less harmful than smoking . &quot;
each other li@@ fel@@ ong smokers dies in his ad@@ diction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all evidence is evidence that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes compared to this are low , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ he has the uniqu@@ ely duty to the information of the public about what is proof of evidence and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative danger of the tobacco . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nearly 80@@ ,000 people die annually at a disease involving smoking , and smoking costs the national health system two billion per year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by clear evidence of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes is not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC should give up East@@ l@@ ders , says former boss of Channel 4
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said , the BBC should stop programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice Command . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give her right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Johnson said that the radio service should only be used to do the kind of programs which are not sent by other UK channels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he cri@@ tici@@ zed the BBC , making it public @-@ legal programs which probably be seen from a smaller audience , in hard controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and sen@@ ders like BB@@ C4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the BBC General Director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson said that he was trying to get in contact with the BBC in his time at Channel 4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are being commissioned or transm@@ is@@ sions , which were also clearly indicated by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; Johnson said the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Communication Committee in the context of his investigation on the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you would like to keep the broadcast fee , what I think medium or long term does not keep its production at least on programs which do not make or commissioned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to reach as broad support to the future as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea that nobody would show this , is a joke , it is ridi@@ culous , it is of course non@@ sense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax program is financed , which may be financed without subsi@@ dies .
the Voice is such a program for East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
hon@@ estly other channels would give her right arm for this .
I try to see how this is to be public @-@ clear TV .
I don &apos;t think so that this would reduce the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , who conducted Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the ambi@@ tions of men that work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC will again release what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , recorded in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gar@@ t lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows were like to sell East@@ er@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said that the more public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C4 , but they may not carry out their tasks , and they can be argu@@ ed , but , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that nobody has seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they put them in a time window that nobody wanted them to see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the broadcast fee , Johnson said to the Committee : &quot; I challenge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions to get the best value of this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , you all remember that one gets a great value for 150 £ a year here , but for those who are for the 150 £ a lot of money I ask if that &apos;s right , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former sky@@ - and Channel 5 @-@ CEO David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , requested that the BBC will check their mat@@ ernity mission to form and maintain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , only little of the BBC production would be officially classified as education - he said that it should be 1 % of her TV production and 0.1 % on the radio , and they should change in &quot; inform@@ ing , clari@@ fy and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful in television is shown to make everything available online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ She@@ &apos;s can control brain cells by sound waves
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the video shows how the ne@@ mat@@ odes change the direction in the moment , in which it is em@@ ir@@ radi@@ ated by means of sound impul@@ ses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists have been bred wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by break@@ downs of sound waves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tiny ne@@ mat@@ odes change the direction in the moment , in which they have vibr@@ ating high frequencies , which are to be heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the impulses work by switching of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ cells , which are gene@@ tically modified to carry out the membrane channels that react to ultra@@ sonic waves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers said that wor@@ ms showed the power of a new method , which may be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Srebrenica an@@ th Hal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian , that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of the brain for treating the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cas@@ c@@ ers are usually not respon@@ ding to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani took it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scop@@ ic bubbles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bubbles , found it out , strengthen the ultra@@ sonic waves that penet@@ rate the wor@@ ms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reinforced ultra@@ sonic waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion@@ ic channels and can be found in the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ m &apos;s membran@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sound waves cause the opening of these ion@@ ic channels , and activate cells that are assigned to them as a report of Nature Communications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to make ultra@@ sonic @-@ controlled ne@@ mat@@ odes , Chal@@ de@@ ani gene@@ tically wor@@ ms the wor@@ ms that some of their mot@@ ility TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion@@ ic channels have been carried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he applied ultrasound at the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ b@@ h@@ ers and transm@@ it@@ ters in the wor@@ ms where they activate the changed mot@@ ility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the method has some simil@@ arities to op@@ to@@ ge@@ , a pione@@ ering tool enabling scientists to switch to neur@@ ons with impulses of light and turning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ ers could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to light , which needs to be sent down to the desired place in the brain , can pass low @-@ frequency ultrasound tissues un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gen@@ y therapy and a therapeutic virus , it is temporarily vulner@@ able to make the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; Chal@@ de@@ ani said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells . he added .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we need now is a step towards the British Government , and the guarantee that Fol@@ lowing Devices cannot be tra@@ ded in front of our door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

eight golden rules to live in student dormit@@ ories
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eleven years ago , I moved to a student dormit@@ ory and still in a student dormit@@ ory , but only now I remember the cl@@ amped smile of those that I stum@@ bled - and on the numerous , long @-@ mu@@ ddy dis@@ comfort over others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of what I learned , can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the move to the student residence ranges from easily ner@@ able up to absolutely sc@@ ary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is temp@@ ting to d@@ ossi@@ p : people share from where you are coming from where you are in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n , and why you don &apos;t love the Sab@@ b@@ t , because in Ernst , guys , it is only a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
breathe in through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and help others to do the same - ask questions , and show interest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it guiding the conversation and helps you to find out what you like in contrast to those who would not speak , even if your eyelashes would be caught fire and these extingu@@ ishers might be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
let people leave .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rooms of people often turn into beverages recipes , film @-@ night venues and public hits , but they are also able to put on their under@@ wear and under@@ wear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
relation : do not remember to start your university with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted obtain a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your room should be a refuge , but many students form a room @-@ to @-@ room bo@@ mel culture that can lead friendly and socially and to life @-@ long friendship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this can be hell for someone who is trying to recover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you , and I want to go on , but you must go away to that I have consumed the energy that I have consumed with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to feel when a comp@@ milit@@ one of our speed is exhausted - and send him a SMS instead of kno@@ ck out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you begin the university at the point of back @-@ Man@@ ia , the kno@@ ck at the doors of humans will be less strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ er years , welcome to you with a place of brow@@ ni@@ es . so , and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
offer tasty homemade treats is a good way to join friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their fellow citizens feel obliged to enter@@ tain himself , and will be associated with a surprise at the end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; po@@ or@@ ly missing s@@ umps from flour , sugar and fat make people sleeping , if you kno@@ cking out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to steal food is an integral crime in student dormit@@ ories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course chicken breasts are a theft , but is it a drop of milk for your tea as well ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
check that with the dairy farm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chances are good that they say to work itself , even if they cook them inside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if anyone mis@@ ses your stuff is that anno@@ ying , and you have my compassion - but try to cope with it as my ro@@ omm@@ ate that washed your milk a det@@ erg@@ ent to pun@@ ish th@@ iev@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is now in prison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you should not make any noise , the people from sleep or from work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only about being a decent man , but that in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb to the people belong in the glass house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl on my corridor asked her neigh@@ bors whether something makes them somewhat more quiet , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they responded with even more loud music .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they ended up at 5 o &apos;clock , she left her neighbours again two hours before she left their own music and finished her door for a three hour test . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would randomly arrive to the same student residence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conver@@ sely , it would not be aby@@ sm@@ al if you have to take a ro@@ omm@@ ate for your future sp@@ ouses itself and experience it every day , how they move all common friends to yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course the heart goes his own way - but if a hot ro@@ omm@@ ate is definitely not your future marriage , try at least to talk about your stay a little reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the exciting moment when you notice that someone else has its key in its closed room , the border between an ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing is fin@@ er than it seems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good course is fun , but it takes only moments until he gets to the bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter a valuable and am@@ using lesson through security , but never forget someone your room with to@@ oth@@ paste and shampoo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; close your door , and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then place in the freezer - but drive their land@@ ings on the ceiling no more than twice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
terra@@ ced houses for refugees in a single @-@ speaking country
the real estate contra@@ ctors Markus G@@ ild@@ er is built in the Medi@@ ter@@ ian Eck@@ ental &apos;s terra@@ ced houses for people who have not much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore roughly for refugees , but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need habit@@ ual residents , but also the mother and the barley @-@ conden@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I show how to be able to build and build well today . &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview
thousands of refugees push for the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ er believes to know how rapidly grown dwelling could be created : it builds in a project of terra@@ ced houses for refugees .
Mr. G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees want to push in the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the mass accommodation in containers or at gym has no sustainability .
for people will stay in a great part here .
in the face of refugee flow we also need enough living room in the coming decades .
a quite tri@@ ales , three @-@ storey holiday house is the solution .
g@@ ild@@ er : a rich house needs the least room .
it facilitates the integration .
this is different when people living in blocks of living .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each of the six houses built just in the pilot project , consists of three units of asylum seek@@ ers each . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may be that many refugees say , it is peace , I go back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the houses can easily be modified according to their needs .
how high are the cost ?
g@@ ild@@ er : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 184 000 Euro without land .
that is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction lasted for six months .
this is appropri@@ ately .
did the construction work complicated their plans ?
G@@ ild@@ er : firstly I have passed the project correctly .
it makes very complicated always the threat@@ ening Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sh@@ am special construction and the slot regulations .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
it is still under@@ estimated who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house and needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities there is space .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did local residents react to their all@@ an@@ age project ?
G@@ ild@@ er : there were who were accused of creating luxury installations for asylum seek@@ ers .
which definitely is not true .
but don &apos;t waste your competition fight for affordable housing ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ ild@@ er : true : we had a boom in Germany over the last five years , but built for luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my project has the message , including ordinary people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not only refugees but also the mother or barley @-@ comp@@ ener .
show how you can still grow best and well build .
it is about that .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple released will be released
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setup App , &quot; General &quot; and then &quot; software update . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some are pushed after installation , because they get an error message given that the &quot; software update failed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to avoid the problem , users are recommended to wait either until the ons@@ lau@@ ght goes back or try to update via iTunes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the telephone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this may probably mean the del@@ etion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it easier to do this , if you put a special tool to er@@ ase apps and then re @-@ install it , once the process is finished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is worth to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update , or is located close to a load device , so that the battery is charged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the load is too low , Apple doesn &apos;t let that the update will continue , as the telephone may be switched on half way and might result in a crash of updates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chess club &quot; Schach@@ fre@@ unde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; set up another member in its ranks , thereby the number of members increased to 19 players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess club and tennis players who held more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen to K@@ ur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the vehicle of the Federal Cross . class and honorary citizen of the cities Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
Schach@@ club in Bad Kis@@ singen has supported G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann with a donation who received the President Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to add chess players that can &apos;t get the membership fee .
youth care and talent search should also be driven forward .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann says that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of his connectivity with the spa town . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ bure@@ au searched for direct contact
Sal@@ udi@@ s and the Al@@ ten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft have put together under the she@@ ath of the social foundation and the Count @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz has opened a new agency .
in addition to consultations you can also take part in courses .
the Social Foundation draws it down from the mountain to the city center .
more precise about the Count @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right next to the shopping market , immediately sen@@ iors and vis@@ h@@ ers receive information on questions such as care insurance or services of health and nur@@ ses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for years , we have realized with our out@@ patient care service that often care products can be left alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are infinitely many questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not too many achievements of the insurance companies are not accepted , because the complexity of insur@@ ances is not yet understood because the complexity of the insur@@ ances as well as business instruc@@ tors Al@@ ten@@ dencies is also responsible for the &quot; Ama@@ deus &quot; executive board as well as for the ambul@@ atory service . &quot; Ama@@ deus &quot; is responsible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the consulting , the new district office also offers prevention , health care and wellness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this purpose the Sal@@ udi@@ s was taken into the boat .
therefore one can use additional offers such as storm prevention , memory training or a physi@@ otherapeu@@ tic treatment .
the offers of the senior centre and the Sal@@ udi@@ s complement each other in an ideal manner .
Sal@@ udi@@ s is for prevention , precaution and rehabilitation .
&quot; the senior centre for care and care &quot; said Heike R@@ ie@@ del , Director of Sal@@ udi@@ s .
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre will see both in demo@@ graphic change .
because this will make a good entr@@ alized infrastructure essential in the individual parts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) focused on the inauguration celebrations in the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program , and they invite you to a regular soci@@ able soci@@ alizing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that makes the social foundation a great contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independent and well in their familiar environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 to 14 am , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 to 18 o &apos;clock and Saturdays from 10 am to 12 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Croatia : &quot; we let refugees by &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls were entered on our border south@@ ward , &quot; said Prime Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls at the Hungarian border stay parallel to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , it is clear that anyone who wants to claim asylum claim that can also &quot; make &quot; of course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the supply and safety of the people are at the foref@@ ront .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear , however , that it requires some signals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept limit@@ less migration flows also not on the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia ref@@ uses
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian government previously announced that Slovenia would also travel to Slovenia , Germany and Germany and may also build cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the interior of the Minister of Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ head Z@@ ni@@ dar saw not so far in Lai@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - mainly to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia . the limit with Croatia is already strongly controlled as an external limit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the Minister , Slovenia wants to res@@ ume its borders for refugees but not abri@@ dged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fulfill his obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ head Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the Croatian government , the first refugees have already tried to travel in the evening hours to Tuesday in East @-@ Croatian border T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to choose the registration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Croatian police attacked them in the near fields of corn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to local media , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police vehicles always meet new refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is mainly around Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days , his country and some 4000 refugees , said Prime Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo would be linked to the Ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian Serbian border , which previously managed to mig@@ rate Croatia to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media linked on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government in Belgrade ranks it , however , that it may be human to strike certain routes : &quot; neither can we do this , nor want we do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to media reports , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , during the day of the day further buses were expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the passengers were traveling through Serbia around 500 kilometers distant from the ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has promised us so the Police said that we should drive here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany by Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , it could actually be a predicted shift from the former Balkans route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a little further west distance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive options for bor@@ der@@ line control &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatian interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously pointed out that his country had prepared for the fall of a strong retreat from refugees , for possible exceptional schedules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he didn &apos;t call his details , but he pointed to Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; comprehensive possibilities to control the border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they conduct strict controls to qualify for membership in the Sch@@ en@@ gen@@ land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia has been part since 2007 , the EU partners introduce a good witness to the country since then . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Serbian side there are still 300 refugees arrested behind the Hungarian border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the media reports , they had the last night on the border crossing Hor@@ gos , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian authorities , the two border cros@@ sings Hor@@ gos and Bak@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the remaining refugees want to travel on the Croatian border still remains un@@ clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Serbian Minister Neb@@ oj@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic was trying to calm Wednesday at a local presence in Hor@@ gos : he think the debates on alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would not currently act for very high refugee numbers .
one cannot say if they would continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers in migrants to - dangerous alternative routes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to spread the land cards in which alternative routes are characterised by Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are still no larger mine fields in parts of Croatia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance was sent in the border region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ p@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard a ring of Cyber@@ crime , which is accused of having ever released more un@@ published financial reports and press releases related to websites like Business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the in@@ surg@@ ent information meant to be an in@@ sider trading on the financial markets .
a total of over 100 million dollars have been launched in this way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our country borders are finally captured , &quot; says the S@@ EC communication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the processes around 32 were further accused in the case .
most of the def@@ endants are from Ukraine and Georgia .
the crimin@@ als are supposed to be active both in the USA and Eastern Europe .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this action was attentive to its 20 year anniversary with this action , and looks quite confron@@ ted with mixed reactions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all about life so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the Ec@@ umen@@ ical hosp@@ ice help is also available for questions and discussions made as the volunteer staff .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always on the ver@@ ge of small discussions about the action , about life , dealing with the die . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

this public @-@ effective action was therefore good for the 20 year old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that not everybody wants to share on the tables , however , be understand@@ able , finally it is a very personal matter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic of death and death is still hairy , as the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hosp@@ ice movements in recent years have helped to open the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an assessment that Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid addresses .
the death and fun@@ eral member belongs to the volunteers of the first hour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by personal awakening , it read a lot of literature and decided to engage in the eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the Ec@@ umen@@ ical hosp@@ ice Aid by calling Hon@@ our , she was reported immediately and was in the founding in 1995 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ def@@ dial belongs to a team of 45 Hon@@ am@@ ers - 43 women and two men - the affected and depend@@ ents in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and Hosp@@ ice in St. Vincent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the panels described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Protestant church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and the church of the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
additional personal wishes can also be recorded in Post@@ cards .
F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed , personal outlook for 2016 lowered
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter , and the delivery giant has a whole year due to vulner@@ able demand for freight service and higher costs in his body@@ transport service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company also said that she plans to join about 5@@ 5.000 seasonal workers on holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set 50,000 seasonal workers for holiday time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the share fell 2.5 percent in the pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit between $ 10.@@ 40 and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year , which ends in the next May , 20 cent less than the previous forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anal@@ ysts expect at a request of a survey on Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lower outlook comes in spite of the price increases , which will amount to 4.@@ 9 percent and will be raised on 4 January . despite the higher charges for land transfers of heavy and large packages that will be raised from November . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said that nonetheless , the result was anticipated , due to cost reduction , higher revenues and due to growth in online stock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company brings &quot; solid earnings , when one sees the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade , into consideration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the holidays @-@ employment were announced a day later than the rival hour UPS , which plans to hire 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional labour force equivalent to the same number as last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first quarter , which ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million was $ , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earnings per share amounted to 2,@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of T@@ acks Investment Research asked anal@@ ysts predi@@ ct . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
six of them asked anal@@ ysts € 12.@@ 23 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported a decline in international priority shipping which had sales in its unit express shipping to stag@@ nating . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last quarter sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for bigger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices while the result of higher labour costs declined in the cargo business .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the pre @-@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares re@@ sang 3,@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , at 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , they included 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on her most awa@@ ited conference in the year , Federal Reserve Strat@@ egen two days spent this week to decide whether it is time for the first time ever since almost a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dro@@ pping over them at an end of the decorated , two floors of seating , is a mur@@ al of the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed Chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ els and their colleagues should set forth the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the central bank has two @-@ fold order from the Congress : maxim@@ ising US employment and prices , keep it stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognised that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision to predi@@ ct it . it will be announced on Thursday if the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned by the un@@ preced@@ ented interest rate being we@@ aned by the close @-@ short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although most data of the economy show that they last@@ ingly grow solid , the youngest turbul@@ ence of the global financial markets do so strongly increase this volati@@ lity by the repe@@ al of the interest rate for federal bonds , and it is only one quarter percentage point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing in what they say , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Chief Econom@@ et@@ aker Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think when they were searching for a pre@@ text that was not to increase the rate of interest , the increased uncertainty is sufficient for the global market to continue , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no con@@ sensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which ensures that the financial market is uns@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about half of the econom@@ ists that were ques@@ tioned recently by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted a rate of interest this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the financial markets however expect a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indication that shows only a 30 % chance to increase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strateg@@ ist fights the blow while they promise that another increase is far away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dow Jones was saved by 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % at 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy holds a proposition in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would highlight the sentences at this point , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she does it , she would have to go very far in her declaration to put the financial markets in order to put her in panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other experts argue that an interest rate would put down the financial markets , because they would deal the uncertainty when the F@@ ed would act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the sentence by 0.9 percentage points per month in this month , the first small step in a slow intensi@@ fication of the mon@@ eti@@ matic conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ els had said in spring and early summer , in spite of the dis@@ comfort of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be required to increase the proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the job creation in August slow@@ ed down , improving the labour market has been improved this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and in close proximity to levels that the F@@ ed is full as full employment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and although inflation was constantly overall under the annual target of 2 % , the F@@ ed representative said that the main reason would be the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy can handle higher interest rates and takes it because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , Chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the financial markets all over the world were ended at the end of last month , after China had dev@@ al@@ u@@ ed its currency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage score fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors were afraid that despite the Chinese economy slow@@ ed down global growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the market has somewhat recovered in this month , the Dow now is almost 10 % below the h@@ och of May . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the F@@ ed representative , market turbul@@ ence influence the complex calculation of how to increase interest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy would not have occurred in this meeting , said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US emergency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now he predic@@ ts that they will wait at least one month , in order to better get the effect better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the effects on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data that describe developments in China &quot; said O@@ lin@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; global economy health is cumul@@ ative of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be included in their decision @-@ making . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in the end result the F@@ ed currency government has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mere reference to the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ ols in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could spread their mon@@ astic expansion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had disturbed the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a world in the markets and econom@@ ies , they are increasingly confident that they can not only monitor the developments at other locations , but also with other central banks and experts to maintain a better understanding of global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their decision making is more art than science , &quot; Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell said , Head of the global strategy for asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeffrey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . I noticed this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a story of inter@@ actions on financial market movements that were apparently not linked to the economic fundament@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; painting , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , adher@@ ing for an interest rate , quoted decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce their mission into three sessions by 0.9 percentage points in three sessions , despite limit@@ er recogni@@ zable impact on growth in the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later the F@@ ed representatives were renamed these cuts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability in 2008 during a severe crisis as the market leader in 2008 , Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee for the Bank of Interest at the Bank of England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the youngest turbul@@ ence do not come near this level he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation where they are afraid of an interest rate because the markets ex@@ changing , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Reserve Act always contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until this is changed , I don &apos;t think they should fore@@ go the time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chinat@@ own .
yes to Chinat@@ own
the market / the camp was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
LA@@ X @-@ C is often referred to as Thai Co@@ st@@ co and is a Thai national market which is also sold to the public .
yes . he is found in Chinat@@ own and not in Thai Town .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the market / the camp is a central stop and offers a conf@@ using amount of fresh , frozen and Asian snacks , popular Thai and Asian snacks , furniture , religious jewelry and Christmas decorations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is even a car section if you need engine oil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the shop is huge , and it takes over an hour to stroll through the cor@@ rid@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the whole shopping makes you hungry , there is a meal at LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen ( good and cheap ) in this shop is close to the c@@ ash@@ ore , and has different picking options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is there : do you need anything ? anything - Thai work ?
LA@@ X @-@ C probably has it .
products are inexpensive and a number of them is sold in large quantities .
fresh products include Asian speci@@ alities and regional Thai herbs grown fruit and more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the me@@ ek@@ e is extensive , likewise the fish ec@@ to@@ e - the personnel behind the bar will clean@@ se the fish and can even fry them on demand for you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good portion of the shop is part of the massive freezing department . here you find frozen cur@@ ry leaves , bitter mel@@ on and g@@ all , whole En@@ tries , fish , cattle flowers , local saus@@ age , commerci@@ ally prepared food and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

parking : LA@@ X @-@ C has its own parking area along with other shops and restaurants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if the shop is well visited , it is not hard to find a parking place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small relief for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
to prepare a warm welcome we do not go without the commitment of countless volunteers .
in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there is a number of people who support in@@ pec@@ uli@@ ar asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
to them Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher and a teacher .
she also enjoys working with her 74 Len@@ zen .
every Thursday she is in asylum seek@@ ers at the D@@ ill@@ inger Street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course this is entirely different from a real school .
Brazilian Pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric Association Rio Grande encourages food for healthy breast@@ feeding
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SP@@ RS , the Brazilian Pon@@ ti@@ at@@ ric organisation , tries to clari@@ fy how important good nutrition during lac@@ tation period . it is done with the presentation of pictures of babies who are in breasts that are painted un@@ healthy food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , which require eating all nutrients which they need to build a strong immune system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers get to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake should not be the only dietary adap@@ tion that you should carry out mothers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a current study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas showed that a healthy diet did actually inhi@@ bit the genes of their babies and protects it from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unfortunately an un@@ healthy eating of the child can influence the immune system negative .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Hall
the Municipal Coun@@ cill@@ or Bern@@ heimer approved the building application for the 2,3 million euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof is allowed to be flat to solar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step forward for the long awa@@ ited gym hall@@ mark on the Bern@@ rie@@ der sport grounds are adv@@ ancing step by step : in the latest council session , the modified construction work has been unanim@@ ously lowered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , the Panel had agreed to an application for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; respect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; universal &quot; liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the &quot; exception &quot; it was permission for a special form regarding the roof structure .
therefore a &quot; saddle roof with a non @-@ central first and roof top was to be built .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; background of planning is the intended use of roof@@ top panels for solar systems : &quot; thus we get a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the liberation of &quot; liberation &quot; was once again to be the roof pr@@ ur@@ ation to be driven by energetic reasons - otherwise than in the development plan - below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the volume of the hall is reduced significantly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the construction plan regarding the roof pr@@ ô@@ le is not permitted - where the Bern@@ rie@@ der commune is rather restri@@ ctive to liber@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in the gym@@ nasi@@ um construction , there is no recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create a precision event , &quot; St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym@@ nasi@@ um at the sports centre is a community project of the municipality and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
approximately 2.3 million euros are calculated at the cost .
subsi@@ dies are expected from school and la@@ titude .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next process , the building application for the 18 x 36 metres will be submitted to the Department of Agriculture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
clinic P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg will be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016 .
Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will be appointed as a new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg via Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this is the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county of Land@@ kreis Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White confirmed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , to this decision , the Supervisory Board , and the Executive Board will vote on Wednesday , 23 September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
plans should be implemented then all of the nearly 50 employees would be on the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move with f@@ ishers and the further existing internal station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the staff who can &apos;t go to Sch@@ ong@@ au , will be offered a job in W@@ eil@@ heim , as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the employees are informed about the plans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the change has triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the tender Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic for the beginning of the year and is now being replaced by a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who declared to take over the line from October 1 , the lead and to his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au said this in any case a &quot; appreciation &quot; and distribution of the offer within the field &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ emaker and de@@ fibrill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialised in the interior of gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the next two years Fischer will be with his team if the Supervisory Board will lead to the close two houses , until the next year the former hospital of the boy , which still has 35 beds , will definitely be closed after nearly 140 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , the district had planned this for 2018 , when the current refurb@@ ishment is completed at the hospital of W@@ eil@@ heim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the presi@@ ding board J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , which is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , came to Ex@@ ce@@ de the House that is owned by the federal road , which should be used as the property for asylum seek@@ ers in future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I close the clas@@ p . &quot; as it goes with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say , there are several consider@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are currently a short term care of the Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ esp@@ sy@@ chiat@@ ric .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what Bes@@ ser@@ i could not happen , such an opportunity does not come again , so fis@@ her over the Qu@@ asi moves to the Le@@ ch , who has been recorded positive and very understanding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a real perspective for the house , working in the fisher@@ man for more than 30 years , have not given it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has been asked of a colleague colleague to take the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was threatened over the past decades and has been closed again by closure of the department and for example the surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the past season , the Bad@@ ener of B@@ HC have a painful defeat and have a good mood there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jag@@ dar@@ ker with two injuries at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been severely injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday morning .
during the aber@@ ration on a corn field at Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) several h@@ unters in use were in the middle of the afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought into hospitals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as it could happen to the accident was un@@ clear first .
the crime police are determined .
missing 16 @-@ year old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a crime susp@@ ects has led the police to the cor@@ p@@ se of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was killed and their bodies were thrown into a canal in rock breaks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one since Saturday the 16 @-@ year old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate failed to break from violence to a victim .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ser@@ che of young woman was found on Tuesday evening in rock@@ enh@@ ausen at Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ors and police officers of Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an energetic susp@@ ect , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who did act according to the claim and investig@@ ators led the investig@@ ator for the discovery of the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported on Sunday morning , after a visit to an autumn mark in rock@@ enh@@ ausen was not as agreed upon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when looking for a young woman , investig@@ ators first strike the personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a survey of friends and other acquain@@ t@@ ances , there was ultimately a crime against the 20 year old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alleged perpet@@ r@@ ator then led the police into a canal in Rock enh@@ ausen , where the body was found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the government inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was killed and the cor@@ p@@ ses were put into the channel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to be led on Wednesday to the Haf@@ fun@@ nel and the investig@@ ators put him to death .
a decision about the nearby circumstances of fact should bring further investigation .
refugees need accommodation : study cau@@ tions locally
the location on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
even more refugees seek a paid lead .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution fights on the German housing market have begun long ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the upcoming refugees and seek@@ ers from the EU , more people thus pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with a welcome weak citizens to make the last affordable apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to cover the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a study on behalf of the consortium &quot; Social Hou@@ sing Struc@@ ture &quot; comes to this result .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by comparison , this year , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are completed in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we are missing at 140@@ ,000 apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer oblig@@ ated to live as an asylum seek@@ er in a first exceptional accommodation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many are to@@ ast in the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to statistics published in the last year less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers stayed at rent .
but the negative development of the housing market is not only valid for growing refugee camps .
the study also makes considerable fail@@ ures in the housing policy of recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany move an accommodation deficit , which is greater from year to year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently in the metrop@@ olitan areas already around 7@@ ,000 homes , Matthias Günther is claim@@ ing the study author . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many professional lived in large cities in standard rooms in ro@@ omm@@ ate rooms .
young adults remained un@@ inten@@ tionally longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; due to the no@@ isy on the housing market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the large cities , the number of square metres per capita in the past years was sun@@ k again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to solve the problem , the Cl@@ an Hou@@ ses proposes a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new incen@@ tives should revi@@ ve the social housing construction .
the F@@ under@@ wer@@ age tax could be wai@@ ved and the plots on subsi@@ dised flats have been fixed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the alliance allows attractive tax depreci@@ ation opportunities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the programme for refugee information of the Kf@@ W State Bank is now well received in cities and municipalities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good week after the start was announced on Monday evening with 184 million euros , more than half of the available € 300 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project could even be enhanced .
refugees have free validity : Croatia and Slovenia to the corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungary , practically no flow is there , since more refugees fle@@ eing the way over Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the journey through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is still dangerous .
Croatia wants to speak with neighboring country Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talked to the Slovenian Minister , and when it &apos;s necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and already belongs to the Schengen area .
the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Scottish @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to reach from there to Western Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
500 persons have come on the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik and reported to the Croatian television station RT@@ L .
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the day before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new laws , which entered into force on the same day , make sure asylum procedures in Hungary is practically unnecessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to pass refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ ano@@ vic explained , &quot; You can travel through , and we prepare ourselves for this opportunity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but be people who did not want to live in Croatia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian police arrested the first refugees on the border of Serbia in the EU neighbourhood , Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to media reports , most of the media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they came both by bus and also with Ta@@ xes in the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately after their arrival , they tried to get on foot across the green border to Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the Croatian @-@ Serb border the refugees do not stum@@ ble on Gren@@ ache .
for this the border crossing occupies other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s .
min@@ ers should now quickly create a secure passage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungary , after the closing of the border there will be no more refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police opened to 366 days on Tuesday .
in short before closing the Monday there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws regul@@ ate the over@@ coming and damage of the gren@@ adi@@ er as a crime .
at the southern Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eged therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated .
the convicted judges up to five years and the expul@@ sion from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the immigration authorities , one held asylum seek@@ ers on Tuesday in the new tran@@ se@@ ater &quot; tran@@ se@@ men &quot; almost all - 93 , on the main transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the applicant were 13 families with small children and two older people .
there were still 40 refugees arrested on Wednesday morning .
but practically no one has granted a view to granted asylum in Hungary .
Serbia is a &quot; secure third country . &quot;
the expi@@ red asylum seek@@ ers should get there .
only a few hundred migrants were gathered in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke before the &quot; transition &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to tidy up workers in rats .
they collected the garbage which had left ten thousands of people over the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
Lock screens were disman@@ tled and one of the recording bearings in the post office was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to express itself at the goal of this uph@@ e@@ av@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Austria is only a few refugees after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the country also reinforced its border controls .
but about 20,000 migrants were still held in the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Salzburg , around 1400 people are waiting for travel to Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the train service from there to Germany was hal@@ ted in the morning on instruction of German authorities .
in Freil@@ ass@@ ing regularly small groups of refugees met on foot .
Mayor drove &quot; stu@@ d &quot; over the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy after the bridge on Sunday with the insur@@ rection , when ten people faced with travel off@@ ences at the tent door , &quot; says W@@ ern@@ st@@ one Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists and they wanted to go with the train to Passau .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because Germany was a surprising public on Sunday because of the refugee camp in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; so Stad@@ ler who instantly offered his help and their cars crossed the border into the near Passau . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
prior to that we had conc@@ e@@ aled the un@@ expect@@ edly guests only once .
we said it right now we bring them by car to Passau .
&quot; of course this was a town@@ ship in O@@ Ö@@ N . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man didn &apos;t let it take over a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; the city was delighted with us . &quot;
the bo@@ unded train @-@ passages were moved on Sunday evening in W@@ els from an ICE line in a regional train to Passau in order to set up the rail service to Germany after the short notice period was still trying on the border .
the regional train was set off at the Inn in W@@ ern@@ stein .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border crossing situation is generally high .
the bri@@ dging association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday remained sporty on Sunday - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as Viktor Or@@ b@@ án , there are now more z@@ ech@@ tens to us , is a logical result of a hypo@@ cr@@ ite policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of prop@@ ens@@ ity in order to help the establishment of structures , our German Chancellor emphas@@ ised the official and public attitude of the Hungarian government into the Dun@@ st@@ Circle of National Soci@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lei@@ d@@ tra@@ geous of these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans , who are now faced in the boundary areas with cha@@ otic conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the poultry have also said that the &quot; Pro@@ mis@@ ed Land , &quot; which she invited and welcomed , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a major challenge , in the face of continuing refugee streams and the coming winter to create decent conditions for protection trying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad at the search for 35@@ .000 winter solid quar@@ ks
Konrad to fully do all hands with the refugee space .
Christian Konrad is the fact that his word has weight .
the government has used the former mighty Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Bank in order to set up a question for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first attempt centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got on grip on Konrad .
&quot; we have no more homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen ! &quot; he reported from his first success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria in Monday had been without great verteb@@ ra@@ e , said Konrad and praised the organisation &quot; championship performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the interior of the Interior spoke of a &quot; silent situation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , Konrad with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 records in the he@@ ur@@ y year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to meet the number , more than 35@@ ,000 accommodation have to be found in the next few weeks - 20.000 to provide countries with 15,000 of the federal government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should there be more refugees we can do it .
&quot; but there is no wet without the ground . &quot; said Konrad .
he has already led discussions with the state capit@@ als .
they would have promised him to make qu@@ arti@@ facts even for the coming refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria it works well , &quot; Ferry Mai@@ er said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar is supported by Konrad .
tomorrow it will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born who will be clari@@ fied as the Church will help .
the asylum coordinator requires the call of asylum in the ORF promotion as we did . &quot;
private individuals can offer easily accommodation on the platform .
you also hopes to be vac@@ ant in hotels that are empty in winter .
by Konrad and Mai@@ er yesterday the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in emer@@ gen@@ cies it couldn &apos;t be that qu@@ arti@@ s must have a certain amount of the handle holder or size of the over@@ coming .
&quot; emergency standards would need to apply for temporary time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to the Ministry of Interior during the office , he founded Konrad with his experience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an older gentle@@ man , whom you don &apos;t say without doubt face any un@@ fol@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
convic@@ tion force be his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er don &apos;t cause any costs to the Republic .
their employees want to increase their number to four to four .
the own source of qu@@ arti@@ stry has not yet been successful .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at the st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the approval .
Linz calls for a better distribution
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only the opening of the urban sport hall and other buildings like Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees , is planning the city of Linz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary , as the person concerned can currently be taken without these measures , says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
further locations can be checked for an emergency .
criticism of the principal of the Refu@@ ge@@ es within the federal state .
other districts too must afford their contribution .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a longer phone with the Bavarian Minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) the state principal Josef P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) has been de@@ coded for further procedure in the refugee question on Monday .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er has assured that the German borders are not sealed .
the further journey of refugees to the Federal Republic is further possible .
but there is now the respective border controls .
there will be no longer any special trains with refugees to Germany .
however the protection of protection would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
the other EU member states called for once more strengthened solidarity in the refugee question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that now Austria is able to control its borders on his borders , &quot; a logical consequence consists of action from the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
the general refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; New shi@@ py@@ ard &quot; in the Linz industrial line is officially closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in four of six floors of office and production building , the stock IT Group S &amp; T moved in , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square metres ) should be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT the smart heads are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T chief Hannes Nieder@@ hou@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can imagine that startup companies from the new shi@@ py@@ ard could be investing and later also to be considered .
from the start S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a question of time . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1.7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T at the Tech@@ Center , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which is one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Con@@ federation ( FF@@ G ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building has been vers@@ ed from Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square metres of resi@@ dual space in the building are already rented , for further 40 percent more requests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ her opened second business in the arcade
Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are the focus of the new shop .
and Jutta became a dog to get a dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this project had to re@@ locate the 49 @-@ year @-@ old In@@ owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the diving @-@ market Ark@@ ade . finally , she now has a@@ quired some additions in the shape of another business location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop opposite the business , in which they are sold among other bags , suit@@ cases , boots and clothing from different manufacturers are now about 75 Euro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
a few weeks ago it was rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have survived for a long time , whether I want to open a shop , &quot; says broad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision for the decision was that also the Fur@@ la producers , which are at home in Bologna , from the idea of a dedicated location , on which only their bags were sold . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the greater Linz , which sell this stamp , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who even has Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has gotten wide from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; me , most if something develops , and I can show new trends at competitive prices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why some woman is able to look at a beautiful hand@@ bag in decoration , also the woman cannot answer with the latest security .
it may be because a nice bag of every outfit is util@@ ised .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer &apos;s ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
this property also links man@@ holes with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether it is alien@@ ated to foreign mis@@ anthrop@@ y , journalists hit or lack of knowledge in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office w@@ akes up the election campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and cuts good on them .
this will also be registered at the z@@ pe@@ z@@ an K@@ all@@ stadt where the grand@@ parents come from the property of millions .
the New York City together with the F@@ öhn@@ Dis@@ ur is a term in the wine @-@ village at the Wine Road .
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant @-@ place is related to -@@ zig corners with it .
his grand@@ father came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his aim to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think I think that &apos;s exciting , but are not so deeply impressed by her K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ ter kind , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has filmed a short documentary about the place and its famous offspring , too , beside Tr@@ ump also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , which is not known for conf@@ ection , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has not brought it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there may be respect for the performance of the family , but also ten@@ den@@ cial the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; is a big m@@ aul , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
random from the nick@@ name to the K@@ all@@ stadt in the radius of &quot; Die &quot; Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - in High German : the An@@ ders , says she .
Tr@@ ump is coming from the village of the don@@ ors .
the Tr@@ ump &apos; success story began in 1885 when the last grand@@ father immig@@ rated and opened in the USA a place for gold mines .
the cor@@ nerst@@ one of the property company was first property of property in New York .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the life of grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : her wish , to return to the homeland , failed on the Bavarian state to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged then . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not receive Tr@@ ump , because he had previously def@@ ected without hom@@ olog@@ ation , the director of the Institute for Gen@@ etic History and folk songs , Roland Paul , to the movie start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this is in contrast to the contribut@@ or to the descendants of the descendants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US , and asked to build a border wall to prevent illegal immigrants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the pol@@ arity , that is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative tr@@ umps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born trumpet , &quot; Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the win@@ eg@@ row@@ er in retirement looks more distant from the Americans . &quot; he is always so thousand . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine this &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he has never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension fund Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions how many K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ ter men@@ tions that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz with a visit is something for the church organ which was generally well arrived .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine it from Donald Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you find it better when he does not dar@@ ing the choice , because &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they that had been at the time of his grand@@ father in the USA , would have been like he had never had arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ land@@ has Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as President ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says she . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ end@@ ula Film , for the Tr@@ ump , has been inter@@ viewed for long , 12 000 Kin@@ og@@ än@@ ger saw it , also in the USA w@@ akes interest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Upper Bavarian village Ram@@ sau with Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain climbing village . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the hand of the Vice President , at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 inhabitants of Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden received the award for gentle tourism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain climbing routes . &quot;
in the neighboring country the Association is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
a &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; may have more than 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protective area .
Seven &apos;s Sunrise dominated the ratings , despite the attempts of Nine to take off the loss of leadership in the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kinson after Can@@ ber@@ ra to report in the loss of leadership of leadership of the liber@@ als but has provided no great shifts in the ratings for today .
the breakfast show of Nine was broadca@@ sted by the federal capital as Malcolm Turn@@ it &apos;s Fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Rival Sunrise , with Moder@@ ators David Cook and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ ths , cont@@ ended in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international television broad@@ casts , to which also Dubai , New York , Ni@@ agara Falls and Cancun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this down@@ side of the distance seemed to be no role for Australian TV spectators , since Sunrise showed an average 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators at the five main towns , compared to the Today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , an easy increase of the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and the last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3.000 ) , but his figure remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today in recent months the gap has shut down to Sunrise in the last few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in August , Today average 3@@ 18@@ .000 in comparison to the 3@@ 30.000 of Sunrise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 went far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as September , sunrise will have an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators to 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine - thanks for checking !

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with former seri@@ ousness of the former seri@@ ousness of the ra@@ pper , Erik Thom@@ son . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new drama of a recent father , who conclu@@ des itself to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 219 million spectators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
critics were asked if Thom@@ son could wear a hit show solo without the Raf@@ er Star Rebecca Horn .
the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; Yes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the X Fac@@ tor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million spectators and hit slightly The Block ( 8@@ 38@@ ,000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two from The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17.@@ 30 p.m. ) of the new quiz show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e at an average 4@@ 46@@ ,000 spectators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ ump@@ ed to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ 000 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia scored 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour s@@ atte 7@@ 20,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hot @-@ Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20.000 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will not be encouraged , that hot @-@ Se@@ at will eventually get through 17 : 30 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars , which was not able to survive the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally published as &apos; sunrise domin@@ ates while the Today stays locally .
the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows - Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki obviously have un@@ aware of who wins the Bachelor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the woman , in which Sam Wood finally ends in the Bachelor , was wrapped in greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and none of the three left lov@@ able girl is certainly not giving , whether she is the one who received the last rose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when we get Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before out of three two , you may acci@@ dentally put a reference to who will be the winner .
Sam Wood uphol@@ ds his lips until the finals on Thursday
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all three women have left in ly@@ rical way , why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ our , am@@ bition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , when the question is asked , &quot; If you , who should receive W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; they could get their answers to the play , who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - besides oneself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the moment when I went into the house and I felt that they were quite compatible , and I thought that they were quite compatible all the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah can be on Earth at both feet , making it so much fun to be together with her , &quot; said Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have seen it together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a pair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit was last week her clear that Wood &quot; of the One &quot; could be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and my family , it was clear to me that this was obviously not just a game - I am already waiting for him , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and when she was asked when Wood select , if not she , she was en@@ ig@@ matic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say it , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor &apos;s degree will be staged on Wednesday 19 : 30 .
originally published as Sarah first choice for Sam Wood ?
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams sent after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a clever decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some coaches have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game when he lost a t@@ angel so , as it did the spin @-@ ru@@ g@@ by @-@ Return from Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 against Minnes@@ ota . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Tom@@ s@@ ula entrusted his husband and gave Hay@@ den the next opportunity to a Pun@@ o Return , also in the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of h@@ ook@@ ies to war@@ n the rest of the team by the mill he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula reinforced Hay@@ ne also in his press conference at the same time .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ s@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was encouraged also by speci@@ alt@@ e@@ teams coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey ; he advised him to forget his cat@@ ching catch and to take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne pat@@ ched in a Pun@@ at that was restored in the first quarter of Minnes@@ ota &apos;s vi@@ kings
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers for his N@@ FL debut . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne left the game field after F@@ um@@ ble and later he told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing which happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne driven the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut then in 2007 when a pass at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area referred to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .

&quot; it is not so far we have to have the causes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free voters chief . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
asylum seek@@ ers want to slide the free voters as fast as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , we also asked for more staff for the administrative department who are responsible for asylum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum in@@ verter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ departed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

4 people are killed when police shoot rubber pads on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal , after the police used rubber bul@@ let against the proposed new constitution , a civil servants said on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the violence broke on Tuesday evening in the district Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi made about 175 miles west of Kathmandu capital city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pra@@ yers D@@ ha@@ kal , executive District Officer , said that more than 1,000 prot@@ esters outside a police station , some of which threw stones and fire@@ bombs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said , the police used l@@ otions and then shot in the air before they gra@@ b@@ bed on rubber pads . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber pads used , of which are known to be known , but are traditionally used as less le@@ thal alternative , obviously the high death rate produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conflict was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nep@@ al@@ onia , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ us@@ i say that new provinces that would be formed within the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were protests in Western Nepal from the Eth@@ nic Group , who would like to have an own state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least 40 people including 11 police officers were in violent fights since the 10 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; killed in August , when the four major political parties have signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a major step in the direction of a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the legis@@ lators voted for certain cl@@ auses in Kathmandu , and officials have said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

originally this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the pressure of the project critics and the F@@ DP faction , Ralf Behr@@ inger introduced the system construction management into the offensive : &quot; we have not yet said any questions , &quot; he said before the council and more than 50 visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is good to meet all rum@@ ors now .
the roughly ten to twelve million Euro costs have been in the discussion for months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intense reactions under sea @-@ owners who came to the meeting , called the pictures and new details on the desired hotel construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , what happens on the good a hectare site of the former premises , is still open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Google will launch dup@@ licate donations campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Google Inc ( Goo@@ g@@ .@@ O ) announced a Dou@@ bling donations campaign , which will help the thousands of refugees that escape the European nations as they flee from war and po@@ orer countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the announcement of donations from donations in his blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of making an executive manager wanted to leave Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who has fled to her family from Kabul , she spent seven years old about her personal experiences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to our journey many dark web and bus routes included , as hunger , thirst , cold and anxiety , &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since the refugee crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ate for help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; donations will be made to four non @-@ profit organizations that provide help for refugees and migrants to provide : doctors without limits , International Res@@ cue Committee , save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Google said that the first global collected donations tot@@ alling EUR 5.5 million will be doubled to the amount of EUR 5.5 million , to $ 11 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe is confron@@ ted by its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the civil war in Syria and more than 4 million people this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

coverage of Y@@ as@@ me@@ en S@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; edited by Christian Pl@@ um@@ b
for slightly superior di@@ abe@@ tics can be helpful loss of loss surgery .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for slightly over@@ ly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s still too early to say , whether slightly obes@@ e people live longer than those who do not receive @-@ surgical treatments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the death data actually require a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of the weight loss surgery which gave a Editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weight loss , or obes@@ ity surgery , using various methods to reduce the size of ga@@ stri@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the years Adi@@ posit@@ as operations have proven efficient to treat type 2 diabetes , but most of the studies were carried out in people whose disease is obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BMI ) from 35 or higher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BMI &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BMI , a certain measure of weight in relation to size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI of over 30 are obes@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can calculate your BMI here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital dates that they have been collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obes@@ ity - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ grown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the average BMI of those who under@@ gone this operation , declined from 31 to 2@@ 4.5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the BMI remained with those that non @-@ surgical treatment treatments were approximately equal to 29 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among those who subjected to a surgical procedure , 36 % of diabetes disease had no less and 28 % partial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , diabetes is entirely dissolved in percent and partly at only approximately two percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the results were better in the checks of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol &quot; in general better in the &apos; surgical &quot; group , &quot; found the authors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers also supervised the patient @-@ blood level of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best below 7 percent and the researchers are reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after surgery , the average ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in fell from around 9 percent to about 6 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however in the medical therapy group it remained stable at about 8 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as did not reflect in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - was not less mortality in five years , so the guiding researcher Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the research team is also toler@@ ated average results with the two types of surgery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and reported rather a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Swedish study , it was subjected to obes@@ e people who under@@ gone an obes@@ ity , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - in comparison to a group whose conventional methods tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery @-@ patient , Black@@ stone said , it is soothing for people with a BMI less than 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study , because she says that this operation is lower in the lower BMI group , without increased risk of death or kidney disease , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their physi@@ cians should begin to take weight seriously , once the patient lies with its BMI between 27 and 30 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we too long wait until we bring people to do this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic modifications , they are rigi@@ dly associated with obes@@ ity and diabetes , is a revers@@ al really hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe can &apos;t record all refugees , the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East would be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist Guide then called for to end violence in the homeland of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit in his speech in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , which focuses on ethics studies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he called for the interests of humanity on the interests of the individual countries , or even continents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries on the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the Dalai Lama , Germany and Austria &apos; efforts to managing the crisis , he empha@@ sized that it was only a temporary solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees , is wonderful but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , like a real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , we must re@@ think about how the killing in their countries will be dimin@@ ished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application of violence never loos@@ ened these problems , &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and also commented on George Bus@@ h@@ s &apos;s action after the terrorist attack on 11 September and presented that the violent response to the USA had a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences to President George , and I told him , the way to resolve this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know , his motives were good , but he put violence and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; the Dalai Lama promised . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
triple jump of heating disinf@@ ect@@ ant due to children over the last 4 years
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poison gas centres in the USA report on a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years , which would not swallow up alcoholic replacement disinf@@ ect@@ ants , thus led to Georgia &apos;s center . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia &apos;s City Center , the cases of revenues generated by hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years containing gas control centres , from 3.@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are getting more frequently over these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go to the emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that some kids can do disinf@@ ect@@ ant , while some they do to impress her friends or for a sample with the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
show videos on YouTube how young people disinf@@ ect@@ ant only because of a cheap experience .
you@@ ths have added disinf@@ ect@@ ant with alcohol @-@ alcohol disp@@ ropor@@ tion in order to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive fragrances of disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; one child does not think that this is bad for it &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the most attractive ones ( hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those who are par@@ o@@ ized .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ant with stra@@ w@@ berries , wine grapes and orange du@@ cks which are very appealing for children .
wall disinf@@ ect@@ ant contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
a few sprit@@ zer can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning especially with to@@ dd@@ lers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Gi@@ ft@@ p Conference in the Hospital of Kansas , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , you would not let slip whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children and when children come from it , then it is a quick way to consume much alcohol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl taken for stra@@ w@@ berry and stra@@ w@@ berry ice @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant brought into school in a period of emergency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 179 , their blood @-@ alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that was drunk by an adult , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey said to have treated her at the G@@ inn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ utes her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doctors survived them over night in a separate nur@@ ser@@ y school on signs of Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma , because the girl was fallen by the alcohol and had pushed the head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was very wor@@ r@@ ying , &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ ahu &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has parents and teachers recommended to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ant and hand@@ disinf@@ ection out of the children &apos;s range .
about alcohol pois@@ oning also have some disinf@@ ect@@ ant associated with deaths .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women after the swal@@ lowing of drop@@ de@@ disinf@@ ection , which had a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; employees of health authorities assume that the product meth@@ anol had a fatal solution , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol which was recorded as an active agent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January , three students from the fourth class in the New York State had to pois@@ oning their &quot; mur@@ ders , &quot; leaving anti@@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , &quot; it reports a police report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic against wall disinf@@ ect@@ ant and f@@ aded them from their space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police looked at the failed plan as &quot; skill , &quot; and presented disciplinary action to the authority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during a rear view on the cross @-@ gap between Nord@@ ring and Ho@@ wever , a 33 @-@ year old car has been slightly hurt in case of finding a car accident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a 60 @-@ year old truck driver ran at the crossing road in the direction of the roundabout and had too late so that two pre @-@ driving vehicles had to be stopped at the roundabout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , he sprinkl@@ ed with his truck to the stern of an audio and sch@@ ob that cars appeared on an earlier Ford Fi@@ esta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case involved , non @-@ damage incurred was about 10 000 euros , divi@@ des the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are rum@@ ors of dis @-@ dis@@ cord at Celtic Glasgow , which was spontaneous spont@@ ane@@ ously . he insi@@ sted that he and his team gam@@ ers are not under higher control , because they prepare a confron@@ tation with the Dutch top guide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think we feel pressure , I think that players are looking forward to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lack of title competition in the Scottish football plane D@@ ut@@ chman - de Bo@@ er
former Rang@@ ers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic times since there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of Celtic Games more and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people don &apos;t just talk about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will turn things around and swe@@ ars D@@ eil@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; RON@@ NY D@@ eil@@ a has accepted that Celtic fighting has to fight , but the Norwegian chef k@@ or , turn things around . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the following exit from the Champions League , the defeat was followed against 10 men from Aber@@ deen , which now clearly stands at the top of the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ eil@@ a said , &quot; Celtic had already had bad times , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very fur@@ ious or sad about what happens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we feel the same - but we must go on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really need the support of Celtic , because that makes the player better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing now is so important .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; there is no team who has won everything , in poker or lip , who won &apos;t win the games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged during the United Kingdom in total .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 while the number of people without a job for the United Kingdom increased by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was 5.@@ 9 percent higher than the figures for National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) in Scotland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , employment in Scotland gathered around 12,000 in the three months , with the number of employees at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.@@ 0 percent - an average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision , part of the United Kingdom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements on the Scottish job market with an increase of employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

why I will be an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somewhat later , except for a late legal intervention , I will refra@@ in like a man to put to death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it happens , and I hope that it is not happening , I will sit in a spect@@ ator in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary if Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is ex@@ ited by the poison gas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses on his death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the invitation was already in January for his best friend , and even though I was shocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the day was closer I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about death penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see execution in the USA , and there are often more applications available to choose who will find a mak@@ es@@ ky lot@@ tery to decide who will be elected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
who is selected who will keep things going on in the work process .
I can &apos;t do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be sitting next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps in tigh@@ test friend , with which I developed my own relationship over the months with teleph@@ ones and a two and a half hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh much when we speak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a notebook and take a pen to record what I see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I simply have to try to remember all details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of giving my un@@ parti@@ ality on Twitter .
here is the lesson .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell the story of the in@@ mates , how he wants to , and you get access . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I compl@@ ained to you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she pointed out that &quot; it could have been form@@ ulate , &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had trouble with some of the things I said and written .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to him , that he can remove myself from his list of witnesses at any time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he wants that an international repor@@ ter is present there to write there .
when he dies away he thinks he will help the public relations of the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware a repor@@ ter by Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post is sitting next to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I &apos;ve made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I can &apos;t say to security that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty , an adv@@ anta@@ geous of being . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I believe that a strong lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood is that he is not guilty of the murder .
I believe in certain that there is not enough evidence to jus@@ tify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and I will see him from that perspective .
I can not claim that really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters who can contact you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what you can get from me is what it means to see a man an unnecessary death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he held back 18 months due to sp@@ ying fla@@ ws , and did not want to see it as too high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have waited a long time , but sometimes you have been so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it expands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes one reacts , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live what I said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today I will go home and sleep well .
I would like to walk around the head and I want to think that my owners think I try my best for it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they start to think , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , Moo@@ dy had tried the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com to sp@@ it up his stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before ei@@ ghte@@ en months , Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart will take in my st@@ ables for information about what I am asked to do in my st@@ ables where I would like to deliver in my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy at Rac@@ ing.com . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they clearly believe that I am a sc@@ amm@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that is the case , they should surely deal with their n@@ oses , because they have attemp@@ ted to write me on their own . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Robert Rou@@ man@@ ston , former Chairman of Route L , David Moo@@ dy , president of Route L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of Route L , were aware of the time and are still today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should this bring me to the mind that it is personally done ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Route L has celeb@@ rat@@ ory behaviour , and perhaps people outside train@@ ers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe the people think there is that I am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe they have to take me my license and rep@@ ented me , and I have no doubt that what I say they can now think about it now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter to me , and that makes me sad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it really makes me sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will practice the pressure on them , and urge them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the master levels of the trainer have built up with the long lasting cob@@ alt @-@ examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Sc@@ rat@@ ching asked that he could imagine &apos; his license on the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the non @-@ beaten Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , called the race @-@ day treatment instructions &quot; ridi@@ culous when a packing of mud or clay has been applied to the horse@@ bits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take over full responsibility , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has caused ir@@ r@@ ze@@ m@@ ously sw@@ am on the leg .
it could have been such a night .
it could have been so yesterday the whole day that was so .
but it was the race day too .
Moo@@ dy could be confron@@ ted with a three im@@ on@@ ati@@ gen dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation on this issue was opened .
it is a joke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who rules these rules , do not know anything about the horse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see one that we need rules , but here one is too far , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
man arrested by drivers
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the weekend , the police arrested a man after a coll@@ ision with a cycl@@ ist and subsequent riders in Cob@@ ram . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cycl@@ ist was delivered to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with heavy injuries , after being hit by a car on Saturday morning at the Mur@@ ray @-@ Valley highway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , the car continued to stop without stopping , in order to help the last driver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Monday , a 50 year old man from Nath@@ alie came from Nath@@ alie in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is expected to be indicted for drivers and under@@ lining support and other traffic @-@ del@@ ights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cycl@@ ist , a 40 @-@ year @-@ old man from Cob@@ ram remains in the hospital . it is in a stable condition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy reject ri@@ vals for asser@@ tions to Ring@@ ers
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy critic@@ ises critic@@ isms at the T@@ ack@@ ling of his player as &quot; Agenda @-@ S@@ etting &quot; of two Premier League &apos;s favour@@ ites . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson told , that the refer@@ ee enjoyed the Storm players &quot; ring fights &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying finals in Sydney on Friday night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brisbane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Benn@@ ett made a hard back to the Storm team , after his team had scored the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he named the two from Que@@ ens@@ land to be &quot; good &quot; in the rings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ er@@ g of his team , and said that she was only concentrated on her contact with the T@@ ack@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading coach at his team accepted him confident , as it means that they did not worried about the Storm team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always turns back - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about Ring@@ wra@@ ps , when she beaten us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing in our def@@ ensive system or the techniques in the whole year . but in the past six weeks we have made our contact with T@@ ack@@ les at a real focus and this has provided a trend revers@@ al for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he probably isn &apos;t getting used to lose it , so it was a bit of shock for him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is funny as this pop@@ s up again at that time of season .
Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea by the &quot; exciting soccer &quot; and remin@@ ded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wayne talks of exciting soccer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday evening he compared his game on Friday evening and how exciting it was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I remember that in 2010 , St George was critic@@ ised as a boring team , and Wayne said that he &apos;ll take care of a divor@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now he has a team that can play and saw it as exciting , especially his young player with their speed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is the ball game which you want to play if you have this kind of players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he made this statement in 2010 , and now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt , so they can play like this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I build stronger trust because they say these things , because they are a bit worried about playing us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think about us when it went around the Big Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ ster scored a higher result than the match bron@@ cos versus cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game ; I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts at our game , but is this an exciting game ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
or are breaks and not points a little ten@@ sion@@ ing ?
for me it is the game boards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once they mention , it means that we will meet in a stage still . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Storm team has free this weekend since they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday evening at the A@@ AM@@ I park . ticket sales will start next morning .
Ser@@ bians with 200.000 $ damage to the drug response
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a man , possibly a li@@ fel@@ ong sentence is threat@@ ening to come to the possession of 40 kilograms co@@ ca@@ ine , who were mu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land in possession of $ 200,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Marko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic ( 29 ) was one of the five men who were arrested the last month after the Federal Police came from South America over V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed how he met his co @-@ accused in the middle of the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of dro@@ pping in a Toyota Echo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite a potentially life sentence for attemp@@ ted to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , it argu@@ ed that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the café could have been a harmless reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Judge at Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was worried about the danger of mac@@ si@@ mo@@ vic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has definite relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia and said to the court on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , he lied to the police for his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as safety together to reach his release . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the agreed statements of the two persons it is clear that the circulation of a safety of 200,000 dollars constitutes a real financial burden , &quot; said Judge Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but that alone will not sufficient to dis@@ courage him , but he warned them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released on b@@ ail , under conditions that he announces his Australian and Serbian passport , adher@@ ed to the police daily and lasts at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

two of the three part trucks had slow@@ ed in front of a permanent building in the direction of Basel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain for the last moment to turn left , like the police triggered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crash &apos;s cab of the accident created completely apart .
the driver was severely injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely locked over six hours until 2 am .
there was a loss amounting to € 12@@ 2.000 Euro .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used a phone of girls to attract educ@@ at@@ ile to send pictures
a pedagog@@ ical used the phone of a 11 year old girl to request images of child abuse .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the phone of the girl as this slept in an online mess@@ aging service that he received a series of continuous pictures of children who were sent to him by another user .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the girl woke up later , discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the asleep H@@ og@@ g . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she saw it by the conf@@ using news and al@@ ar@@ ming immediately her mother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police looked at it and saw the five pictures , analyzed then computer that were found under the address and discovered &quot; Web @-@ research , the terms for search of un@@ imposing images of children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ og@@ g claimed to say to the officials , that he would have done it , as it would lead to &quot; p@@ seud@@ oph@@ ile in the Internet , &quot; and he then , there was a polic@@ eman , to make her fri@@ gh@@ ten . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pro@@ secutor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ t@@ son said to the Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said , it would be a ad@@ diction that he would be hoo@@ ked to people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered that the searches were conducted by him , and said , it was done , because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman , to make pedagog@@ hil@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures , and he asked him to send more photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that he did so to l@@ ure it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said he was sick in the head , when he drinks , and he said , He will see images of rape and murder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MS Rober@@ t@@ son added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was at the cit@@ tern and crying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she then saw the in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous pictures on the phone and con@@ front the accused .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the girl was inter@@ viewed and said , that the accused computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation used to speak with girls who looked much younger than he . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ de@@ e , pleaded not guilty to the conditions of the indictment , to be rejected on 25 January this year and did not appear before the court hearing a hearing on 24 March this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; def@@ ending Law@@ yer Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g may not appear in the Register of sexual crimin@@ als , as one could argue that &quot; there is no considerable sexual element in his going to be found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael disappeared from the verdict until October to obtain background reports on social work .

it was still admitted before the date of the verdict in the list of his sexual off@@ ender .

Stuttgart : fo@@ oth@@ ills of Henry &quot; in the southwest
meteor@@ ologists are present in front of winds in the southwest on Wednesday afternoon .
the German weather service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart accounted for a deep depres@@ sive atmosphere on Western Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vig@@ orous twist is Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; past few days from the Bermuda Islands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , the last longer leaves the sun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the mass makes it : every two years the high@@ lighting at the IAA sees its news .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , mainly movement on the compact car , which currently sell particularly well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at present , cars from the compact class are particularly popular : approx . 28.@@ 1 percent of the new appro@@ vals ( KBA ) accounted for at this segment alone in August . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is also reflected in the IAA ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among all the futuris@@ tic concept automobiles and new luxury cars , this year , many new compact models are presented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the biggest ri@@ m@@ ings for the German car industry is the Opel Astra that will be used in the autumn by the dealers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus the volume model is also sold well , the new Astra should not be much more expensive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Opel is launching a start below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf in the prosp@@ ect of taking a distance of 17 650 euros .
the current Astra price from 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra boasts a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the H@@ es@@ sia offers further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , among which also three @-@ cylinder gasoline models are included . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unlike the main competitors , VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only in fifth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second one will follow the Com@@ bin@@ ation , which is also available at the IAA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra &apos;s competitors in the race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively shown as fifth in a conventional and empha@@ sized sporting GT version . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the trade he comes to the beginning of next year and then as a com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan driver wants to find its position in the growing segment with its new model .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the compact Infin@@ iti adap@@ ts itself to the brand &apos;s design line , with its curved lines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno that celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter tur@@ bo@@ charged engine and a power output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is measured by production data at 170 Newton meters ( Nm ) .
the sales start of the Bal@@ eno park in Europe is scheduled for 2016 .
DS 4 : not quite new but completely renewed the compact model DS 4 is completely renewed at the IAA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; outside , the designers of the noble Citro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers was laid on the front part : the radiator grill was newly drawn and the modified head@@ lights have been equipped with LED technology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system is moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons is reduced by a touchscreen and the first Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are human
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Constitutional Court gave an explosion of ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ees of the Supreme Court Te@@ gel , which was housed in a tiny little cell for months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the injury of their human dignity , prisoners have generally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this decision was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision on Wednesday .
the persons concerned can even hope the judges if they were imprisoned only a few days in the narrow rooms ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
this was an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitu@@ tion@@ ist in Karlsruhe : he was housed in a single cell composed of around five square metres of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , the man was again transferred to the un@@ ob@@ struc@@ ted base after the data of his do@@ v@@ ure in a larger cell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his term liability due to unexpected adh@@ esion against the Land Berlin failed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Constitutional Authority took off the judgment of the chamber of Berlin and had the case to re@@ trial upwards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they see the man &apos;s human dignity .
chamber Court - decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if for legal reasons , only a few days of liability for compensation would be author@@ itative , be a compensation , called it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise it would be a worry of the legal protection of personality . &quot;
the chamber Court must now clari@@ fy the amount of monetary policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , the constitu@@ ters have often strengthened the rights of prisoners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they therefore said first in April to a prisoner , because he was imprisoned naked in a cell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; human un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 , according to the majority of a cell without separate toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , on Wednesday , the Berlin Constitutional Court confirmed a decent accommodation for a prisoner in November 2009 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the then K@@ lä@@ ger was three months daily , from 15 to 21 hours in a homogen@@ ous cell , as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Berlin pris@@ ons have also come to the head@@ lines in recent weeks due to missing staff .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; det@@ ain@@ ees will therefore keep 23 hours including the aggres@@ si@@ veness , even to But@@ are , because of the cl@@ amped situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to information of the judicial authorities , 21 agencies shall not be occupied by young hed@@ geho@@ gs due to lack of offspring . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we &apos;re creating this &quot;
the migration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to adopt them .
what is coming to Germany ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers come to Germany in Germany , according to Germany &apos;s title by Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is able to record a million refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrated in view of the unusual challenge resol@@ ute : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can do it . &quot;
an overview of what comes to Germany provides the following overview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a separate forecast between 350@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry ) and 400@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) flats , the next five years are needed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is almost twice as much as it is built ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lack of living space , but especially with affordable rental properties : every year , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social expenses came out of the rental price , and in order to apply these particularly affordable housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Austrian Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) aims to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to a billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; much too little is that , from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social re@@ wards per year would need to develop and therefore , the wai@@ st@@ band has to invest by 6.1 billion per year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists and the Federal Minister for Invest@@ ors are in doing that there are also more tax advantages for investment in residential construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research and Vo@@ cational Training , 55 percent of poultry in Germany can be employed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , refugees in Germany would not systematically be asked for their qualification to assist them with Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , for the integration of refugees , it is crucial to find whether they are working in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the este@@ em in the admission charges , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of migrants , says Mig@@ rational researcher Dietrich Colonel Blatt@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , a political turn has been given : from work ban for refugees to recognition of labour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while it was a job ban for asylum seek@@ ers from up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the resi@@ den@@ ces to restri@@ ct asylum seek@@ ers to a residence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society - also because of the expertise of skilled workers - majority , the visibility makes it possible that migrants should become faster access to the labour market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
missing German hur@@ dle has access to the labour market .
there is no sufficient offer to generally and appe@@ tiz@@ ers .
examinations also show that jobs are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
the setup of networks is therefore according to view of thr@@ ben@@ hardt the royal road to achieve working integration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Berlin School Administration has found that only a few wing@@ ed parents give their children to the day@@ care of ten to 15 percent , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ sch@@ em@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in Berlin Senate management . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to convince the family of the benefits of put@@ a in various languages the administration work in various languages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the need to raise col@@ lars by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity by increasing more professional schools . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the countries students without knowledge of German is being prepared in welcome classes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they will not always be taught by qualified teachers and teachers , but as in Berlin , also of teachers who have only qualification in German as second language . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no lack at them says Be@@ ate St@@ olas from Berlin school management .
the German Student Association estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle , no federal state asylum seek@@ ers or toler@@ ated the study - the only exception was Berlin , In@@ sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) has now abandoned his attitude . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
studio content refugees could easily be facilit@@ ated by the university .
for refugees with a residence or toler@@ ation do not get any services after asylum seek@@ ers more if they begin studying .
the latter generally does not include BA@@ fö@@ G as it does not fall under the circle of af@@ ore@@ mentioned persons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to date , the refugees have to have lived for four years in Germany to date BA@@ fö@@ G to be shortened from 1 January 2016 onwards , this range has been shortened to 15 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this finance gap must also be closed , calling Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin State Secretary for Science , and the German Student Association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
students should immediately get BA@@ fö@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in future Islam will re@@ play a more important role , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many is religion important part of their identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state should deny Islam the same rights as they have the churches , and develop the existing state @-@ to @-@ law to a new state @-@ religions relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the establishment of an Islamic welfare association which is professionally designed to take care of new arri@@ vals .
the rights also includes duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in so , representatives of Islam must be un@@ clear and willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and to give certain control options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also belongs to the will@@ ingness to struggle against religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , expressed concern for fear , religious conflicts might also be carried in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted such conflicts in Germany wanted to have right away their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it suggested to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will in future be much more than a topic of society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to change the majority of the majority , the removal of discrimination and rac@@ ism is tough@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - since a decade a anti @-@ discrimination and General Gender Equality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it lear@@ ns very slowly , as the NS@@ U @-@ M@@ ord@@ series showed systematically ignor@@ ing the rac@@ ist motive in the police and authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; equal opportunities for all : what mig@@ rant organisations and the stak@@ eholders are engaged in non @-@ white German for long @-@ term debt , in the coming years , if the country must remain peac@@ efully and its new people should use their opportunities - for the benefit of all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , Germany would be able to maintain medical care for such refugees , the President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding Man@@ - Power and capacities , we create the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however additional money needed to flow into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks and canc@@ els Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery at all loops equal to the registration of health cards .
the services may be calculated later with the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able , so many people devoted to the limited performance catalogue , which refer to the asylum seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise physi@@ cians can make doctors to create the language barriers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de detected , migrants are worse than their diseases being explained as other patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not only in clinics or medical practices would have to be taken over for interpre@@ ting jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would be helped many refugees with more general medical centers in the emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and with another diagnostic look .
among refugee dwell@@ ings roughly there are significantly more un@@ treated disability and with the young people it is going to en@@ ligh@@ ten HIV infections .
but with some of the other clinical pictures German doctors came from her education and says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery writes .
&quot; paras@@ ite diarr@@ he@@ a or tuber@@ culosis are not so hard to recognize . &quot; and what concerns the doctor &apos;s trouble is perhaps even relief in sight due to the refugees .
Syrians would have been a highly developed educational system . some refugees were even doctors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to practice this , however , they would have to prove their qualification and perhaps un@@ equi@@ vocal examinations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least half of the refugees in Germany are mentally ill too : most suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
he is especially vulner@@ able to refugees who are Dietrich Mun@@ z . President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study of TU Munich announced that every fifth Syrian refugee status is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder , is suffering from so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with breath @-@ not , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart ra@@ ses and death too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
further symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders , strong scar@@ ves and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to prevent the symptoms of chronic symptoms would be chronic , early treatment explained , Mun@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but up to date only four percent of psych@@ ologically ill refugees get an psych@@ otherapy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seek@@ ers can put an application for psych@@ otherapy in the social profes@@ sions , it usually lasts several months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , social workers or physi@@ cians who are generally not trained in social disorders , either whether treatment is necessary or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this often lead to mis@@ interpre@@ tations ; he says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the new production &quot; Passion , &quot; Circus Pro@@ bst can rely on the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to draw for every age group in the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and single entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to dream in the cir@@ cus on a brick .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine without my Circus family &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst , Ani@@ mal teacher and junior staff .
&quot; passion &quot; - this is the motto for current management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for over 33 years , the cir@@ cus is in the hands of the Pro@@ bst Family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gift to inspire is the family in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to catch the people from their everyday calling and taking it into a completely different world for two hours , empha@@ sizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with World city fla@@ ir &quot; so director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept .
50 towns on the barely 3 000 km long tour can now experience this fla@@ ir .
the Circus Circus is convincing by talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excellent at the international Circus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v Clow@@ n Family draws the audience with a joke and charm in their spell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
it wants to easily hold the Cuban duo with the heroes of the silent film .
lightness and flexibility - identify them with these words .
their hum@@ orous art on the mast is to capture women &apos;s hearts in the storm .
besides through numerous salmon sal@@ ves the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ate with finger@@ tips and joints .
balance with the unic@@ ycle on a ball ?
for He Yuan is no problem .
sna@@ ke people fascin@@ ate and sc@@ are at the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with its oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascin@@ ates with its flexibility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family &quot; says Steph@@ an@@ ies mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
ab@@ norm@@ alities in the position of cir@@ cus are often so often subject to various animal welfare organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephanie Pro@@ bst takes his position as well : &quot; if our animals are not good , we don &apos;t know well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every mat@@ ernity unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes , &quot; how they are called loving , will be read by the eyes if possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with animals and have fun with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the animal does not feel good , it doesn &apos;t want to be in the ring . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the upper@@ most order is : good for the animals .
especially on their Zeb@@ tal JU@@ MBO just a mix from a sh@@ all@@ ish pen@@ ony@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra@@ st@@ mare is the family Pro@@ bst proud .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two animals lived together in an eb@@ bs eight years , and nothing has happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our small JU@@ MBO was there , &quot; tells Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ ox is still not ready for the ring but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
so there should be something for each visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is sure , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst : &quot; whether five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with my whole heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you with performances from 17 to 20 September daily at 17 o &apos;clock and 20 o &apos;clock .
the beginning of Sunday will start at 11 and 16 o &apos;clock .
Thursday is a family day for the performance at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced .
the daily exhibition is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe keeps false speech in Parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest specialized guide and fell down the stairs from the beginning of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case spread quickly over social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament &apos;s opening was also troubled by statements by members of the opposition , that they had been warned of anony@@ m@@ ously and to accompany the address by Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ u@@ ffles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month , they cast him out and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the Nation , which he repeated his speech on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven Op@@ positions politicians have received SMS messages on their phone that they were able to distur@@ b Mr. Mu@@ ch &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that will not appear , but she said the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; he said repor@@ ters on Mu@@ q@@ u &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she war@@ ns the affected Parliament members that the immun@@ ity ends in parliament , and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leader said that the Party guided by Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; worried about the dangers for the politicians .
Hewlett @-@ Packard will reduce up to 30.000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard will invest 25.000 to 30.000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HP will split into two listed companies , and will separate the IT and printer shop from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service @-@ added activities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the expected job specimen resulted in a load of about 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , and HP said in a declaration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive Mem@@ ber@@ ship after the separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise is smaller and more focused than the HP is today , and we have a wide and deep@@ ened portfolio of shops , which support companies when moving to a new style of business . &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an independent company , we are better placed than ever before to satisfy changing needs of our customers all over the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion annual revenue and will be on the provision so far , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; such an explanation of the company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of the Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in order to make the Pal@@ o Alto Garage &quot; called &quot; the birth@@ place of Silicon Valley . &quot;
HP has gone through a massive restructuring to cover the conversion of traditional PCs towards mobile devices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this area which is based on the belief that closely focused companies provide better performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
FC Arsenal captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates before the play against Dynam@@ o Zagreb will have to stand behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ enger said to Wil@@ sh@@ ere , that it was first September and if his rehabilitation is going to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this optimistic scenario is already saying that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will be sure to miss at least the next four games in England , and in view of its history is certainly uncertain about the European Championship in the next summer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great dis@@ grace with this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury , and then back to its old momentum during the pre @-@ season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this kind of injury threat@@ ens not the career &quot; said W@@ enger .
it is a bone which is not good for healing .
this is not a major matter .
it was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kl@@ es or with the injuries which he had before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that may be true of pure medical notice , but as W@@ enger also recognized , there is the associated danger of other injuries whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant model .
Prime Minister In@@ j@@ on Ltd has recorded 23 different ill@@ nesses of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut at six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of ar@@ sen@@ als as 157 league players in the last five times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bro@@ ader picture of Arsenal is that in six out of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 , one of the two Premier League Clubs , which have recorded most vulner@@ ability days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
W@@ enger accepts the potential of a v@@ icious circle but Arsenal thinks that an improvement in the injury rate during the last season lasts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , if you come back from a violation , you have a time to strengthen your body strengthen your body and gain strength , &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope , be stabili@@ zed his body , I am confident that he will do it and going through a career of the way he deser@@ ved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Arsenal begins his Champions League @-@ season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea to Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on the upcoming Wednesday and W@@ enger is one rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey does not travel to Croatia what means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are able to start .
W@@ enger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to maintain the balance and to give the players it need to be a sn@@ acking pause , &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Arsenal is clear , by group F , Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the playing fields with the greatest in@@ ti@@ mid@@ able effect in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten to 41 games after the &quot; un@@ defeated &quot; campaign has started in the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , whereby the mag@@ nit@@ ude of 3.2 was measured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
W@@ enger is the opinion that Arsenal had pulled out the lesson from last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains with his management to lead the association to his first Europ@@ ap@@ oc@@ al triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense &quot; said W@@ enger .
it has never worked with Arsenal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in the business to be realistic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are ambitious but we are not a dre@@ amer .
friendship Fest : the com@@ edy show that grants us serious lessons about male friendship
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially regarding the need for men to open , now even more desper@@ ate than ever before , how suicide among young men prove to a 15 @-@ year high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in males aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and there are three times more common in men than women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ aign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ment ( Cal@@ m - Camp@@ aign against an her@@ edi@@ tary Life ) 2015 as the year of the husband , aiming to ask the culture to seek assistance if they need them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friendship is the heart of the fight to master this challenge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recent study with more than 2,000 high @-@ school pupils with depres@@ sive symptoms established that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his opportunities for recovery has doubled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends reduce the risks of mental problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but of course you have to have friends so that a friendship can work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Age of social media , with their main focus on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our digital life have the need to appear strong , li@@ fel@@ ong and successfully , even if the isolation domin@@ ates the isolation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this superf@@ icial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists define ex@@ tr@@ ins@@ ic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner lon@@ ging for personal development and friendship , which affects our spiritual health much deeper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and like a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently stated , money can really not buy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the beauty of Friends was that these focus was on the head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each character has not been defined by his work , but by his personality , ex@@ pressing through the interaction as a friend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hum@@ ili@@ ation of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler , hu@@ ck@@ ling and lon@@ ging by Ross to Rachel - all this came out of knowledge that men can get back in every case , even if they often go back to explore entirely their feelings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a worker of phone care , it explained to me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my en@@ roll @-@ roll for people who feel de@@ pressed and sel@@ fl@@ aked , how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the men who contact us are often not able to speak with friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old expression &quot; I come along with it &quot; has a tremendous impact , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Friends is one of the shows that comes to me when I try to provide long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
she presents quite clearly the little moments of men courtesy .
so much my objective out@@ sider @-@ status information about the phone in moments of desp@@ air also help to help the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so , if you visit com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with celebration of the day completely re@@ designed back@@ drop , why do not take your friends at a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even better when you sit in Star@@ bu@@ cks somebody alone , give him a smile and say hello . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
never know what difference is your friendship could be done .

di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ushing Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria is celebrating with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di and Edinburgh son Cav@@ ani after its hits on Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G on Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and response to the game .
angel Di Maria and Edin@@ son Cav@@ ani continued course when Paris Saint @-@ Germain in the season started with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; di Maria made less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French champion to the way , before they finally climbed to their lead , when Cav@@ ani scored a head goal in the 6@@ 1. minute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk , Paris is also required to launch a strong launch against the Swedish masters , since it does not only aim the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ fin@@ s in each of the last three campaigns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but while they got the points , it was not a classic game by Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ him@@ oval posted chances before entering his home team and against the club , with which he began his long career in 1999 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . so it &apos;s a good start to cause our opponents and to relax and relax , even if there are certain things we need to perfect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a good sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret it didn &apos;t get one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic returned to Paris under one of three changes in the Paris team , which could hold on the weekend a 2 : 2 un@@ deci@@ de@@ dly at their own place against Bordeaux in the first league , but was finished in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Argent@@ in@@ ean flu@@ gel@@ mer was named captain of the PS@@ G on the next level in Europe when he went in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass , before he finished Johan Wil@@ and finished in the long corner of the network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would have achieved a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Malm@@ ö , the Celtic in a Play @-@ off fought in the field with nine national players , and was excited by a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid @-@ area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but except for a shot by Nik@@ ola Dj@@ ur@@ dj@@ ic who passed far to Kevin train tips on the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , PS@@ G himself drew himself sometimes with some failure and bad dis@@ connections , not least of I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , who was abandoned in the first half alone , after Cav@@ ani had inserted it after the restart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , he proved much more skill if he turned his fellow player to the game , and it was a pass that was driven by I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , who was driven by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute by the P@@ fo@@ sten ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , the second gate was finally reached after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the prime minister thus scored his sixth part of the season after I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic was a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did all thoughts that Malm@@ ö got to the game and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from the short distance to David Lu@@ iz could stop the final result before the substitute for E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi used a gate at the end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach from Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later gave PS@@ G a class on his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , we only played the Swedish League , which has not the same level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the qualifying games do not suff@@ ice . &quot;
hat off to Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : P@@ EP Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European X@@ avi plays in Qatar for Summer 2015 for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the FC Bayern was obviously recently ahead of the commitment of Spain Super@@ star X@@ avi , which then played for FC Barcelona . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eight times of Spanish Championship , three times champion League , four times champion League winner , two times European Champion , two times European Champion , the title list of X@@ avi is stunning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the summer the 35 @-@ year @-@ old moved to FC Barcelona to Barcelona and transferred to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi is now on the road ahead of the EM 2008 depart@@ ing from Barcelona . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you told me that Bar@@ ça wants to sell me . &quot;
&quot; Madrid then won everything we do nothing . &quot; he tells us .
and they also registered the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was a supply of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have . &quot;
reminder : in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi did not changing
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man therefore works for the German record champion : P@@ EP Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken from Guardi@@ ola , and I played a great EM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ EP told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he could not imagine the crew without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he has cared for me . &quot;
who knows how the 2008 / 2009 season had run with X@@ avi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter of the Champions League from Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn , turned the red from ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the royal triumph at the end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in the movie
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on the diversity and said , it &apos;s not required behind the scenes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while a result of Sunday Night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown inter@@ sec@@ uted as these the need of alternative perspectives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we talk about diversity , then do it in the occupation of the movie and not by the occupation of the show , &quot; insured Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Brown responded . Brown responded to un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! Wow . OK ... &quot; as the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian himself strengthened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers of producers Ben E@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers , to discuss about the show fin@@ alists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to ask people to think about it - whoever will be the director of Harmony - like she wrote the harmony of Harmony , &quot; Brown initially said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only black person , and she is a sp@@ line , which is beaten by her white dec@@ lining . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the producer of Creative White People were directed to the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the direc@@ ting rights to the film ; Dam@@ on won &apos;t give us something that we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the discussion has been broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded against dis@@ appro@@ x@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Po@@ oni pushed his rage over the clip , calling &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in space , so he can explain their diversity - that is SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Council served more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its release . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ ons comments occur at a time when the exact ra@@ cial representation was held in the media , at the head of the social discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the teen@@ age Michael Brown killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the movement of Black lives achieved its effect and ur@@ ged lawyers and authorities to present discri@@ min@@ atory practices against colour content . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in February , the singer Prince made a recording to the movement while introducing the nominated albums of the year to the Gram@@ my Awards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; album still matte &quot; ( albums have still their meaning ) he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like books and black lives , albums also have their meaning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more recently , leader of the Black lives mat@@ ter published a declaration as response to the question of Fox News Person@@ ality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Network Black lives Mat@@ ter is a love group . &quot; they said the leaders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently announced that Dam@@ on was invited to visit a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media makers to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether he accepted the invitation , or has already made the Pope , is un@@ clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

professional sports enthusiasts Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete that won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million with home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the competition Show , which ended just her 7th season , had never experienced one competition participants , who could close all stages of his obst@@ acle course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the season , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , until the final . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope belonged to the last task in 30 seconds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brit@@ ten ended up the task within the time when he finished the first ath@@ lete , which made the exhau@@ sting phase 4 by American Ninja Warrior . however Cal@@ di@@ ero made this challenging three seconds faster , which made him the winner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! messages after the victory of the grand victory , still under the shock about winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never had any more than $ 10,000 or had a life , &quot; Isaac E ! about his bun@@ ch of money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
suddenly .. as I imagine I can &apos;t even imagine how it is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leading producer K@@ ent WE@@ ED joined The Hollywood repor@@ ter in order to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , though it ended first at all , not any prize money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the rules the money comes to the quick@@ est person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , the one gets the fastest time , &quot; said WE@@ ED . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , he ob@@ tains the great gra@@ ti@@ fication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t think he gets a groove .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad that Isaac is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt as one if they had sli@@ pped the roles .
America Ninja Warrior has been extended to last season and will start filming in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers mu@@ gs up to Minnes@@ ota T@@ wins
the second half of the season was not especially fun for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tiger &apos;s place in the American League Central . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tiger have been reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but did this part perfectly play against Minnes@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the T@@ wins used a chance for Ascension within a half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card @-@ Platz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Detroit , if only for one night , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word that was so hard to gra@@ sp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all victories have fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad A@@ mus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support , when Detroit had scored three times in the first two places , once in the sixth and then again in the ninth place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) stayed for 6 times in the 1 / 3 inner and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful launch in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to quit this year &quot; says Simon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to throw at the bull@@ pen of each game , and therefore I will really concentrate in the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the designed tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Martin@@ ez had three hits and was in two edges of his first R@@ BI@@ s since the middle of August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game of Martin@@ ez since he had four hits on the Seattle on July 6th .
&quot; he has ru@@ ined the impact on drums . &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he looked good at ( impact training ) , looked much better in the bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with three R@@ uns at the end of the seventh position , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into play . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning by a double at the left field line .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks got a bun@@ ch , and Simon brought his second b@@ ass@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier for the Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the Link@@ sh@@ ank Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ dy ran down the wall , the only man to confron@@ ted with whom he was confron@@ ted , before the designed R@@ ook@@ ie R@@ ook@@ ie Miguel S@@ ano , who escape a two @-@ run ri@@ ms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a pair of runners and the conclusion @-@ run in the second hand , Ver@@ h@@ agen brought the third b@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the major league of the 27th time in this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe beat a double Play . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Detroit , at the end of the ninth interior , the wall added a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the tiger Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the right @-@ handed ring is located at three Pit@@ ches for his fifth save .
Detroit benefited at the start of the game from a still not moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tiger scored three R@@ uns on the first two inside against the right @-@ handed v@@ ets , which had been dot@@ ted before the play of the vulner@@ ability list , after having been ab@@ sent over a month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning they wished me , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I feel better when I started and felt that I would get some pretty good Pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off batt@@ ali@@ on in the first part of the Le@@ ad@@ off batt@@ ali@@ er , H@@ eine gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Martin@@ ez brought Victor Martin@@ ez playing a single &quot; up the middle &quot; in the first run of the game .
Victor Martin@@ ez reached his 0 @-@ 21 success story with the runners in the sc@@ oring position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed a single on the right hand , managed to run a further run , but Victor Martin@@ ez was thrown out of the game when he tried to come to the third , which finished the threat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tiger observed in the second , scored a one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James McC@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has not really well beaten , but has caught the right place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a Pit@@ ch Count Count not scored any points in the third inning before being replaced by the Rel@@ e@@ ver ret@@ ards A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns at six hits and a walk with four strips .

Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German participation in Syria for a possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I believe that the adoption of military action options must not be held without Germany . &quot; he said .
he threw the European states &quot; collective travelling &quot; in front of it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four years ago , we were happy that the cup of a military engagement has passed in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now the conflict starts in front of our door . &quot; he said in Deutschland@@ funk .
the former German ambassador in Washington also demanded a massive increase of international assistance from site for refugees .
Austria controls the southern and eastern borders
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Germany , Austria has again adopted controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said to the Austrian TV station in the Austrian TV station ORF , after Hungary no one will be back now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany too has sent no refugees to Austria .
&quot; no . this is so agreed . &quot; she explained .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to an agreement , after which Germany could receive a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , said Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , said it has already been given consideration between the General Director for Public Security and representatives of Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
concrete numbers were not calling them and posted on discussions on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees attended the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary to Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
your goal is usually Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) , and her Austrian colleague Werner Fay@@ man applied together with several other EU leaders and heads for next week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , the EU states have not yet to have a joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , 22nd September the EU interior ministers must take a new attempt to the binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the face of the strong refugee business in Germany , the Federation wants to support countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League will manage this together with the countries , announced Merkel in the late service evening after almost four @-@ hour consultations on the Federal Chanc@@ ellery in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Merkel over@@ bott@@ led people who need protection and would be@@ gu@@ ise this too .
but who don &apos;t have any lead @-@ eye view he couldn &apos;t stay in Germany too .
this view had been ind@@ ented in the round .
the ch@@ anc@@ ellor empha@@ sized that the state as a whole must now overcome a &quot; huge power unit . &quot;
thousands of desper@@ ate refugees join the Balkan Route .
Hungary had its 175 kilometres long border with Serbia on Tuesday .
a few hours on it announced the government in Budapest but also the border to Romania with a fence .
this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wants to avoid the tugs of the Rou@@ tes in Romania and Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new Gren@@ zz@@ au@@ n .
the Romanian government condemned the plan immediately .
there were first arrested beings that had cut through the fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Turkey , there are also thousands of migrants attemp@@ ting to Greece to the Greek border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
room sunny &quot; Cas@@ sini &quot; takes a view of Saturn at Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the ice @-@ dance of Saturn there comes En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us a global ocean .
these are the names of researchers from the space probe &quot; Cas@@ sini . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the moon , the moon is easy on its rail to ring the ring . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although this diving motion is only small , but too large for a per@@ plex@@ ity of cel@@ esti@@ al bodies , it is made in a press release from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state New York ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the researchers put their analyses on the subject of I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
it was already longer known that there must be some liquid water under the ice ceiling of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2006 , Cas@@ sini has discovered ice @-@ vul@@ can@@ es on the south pole of Saturn , which sp@@ it water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called e @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least in the south end there must be a underground sea and astronom@@ ers included back then .
the expansion of the hidden ocean was however not clari@@ fied .

no diet fruit - man@@ go contain lots of sugar
Mang@@ os are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he who wants to pay attention to his slender lines , often negle@@ cted by them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Mang@@ os contain relatively much sugar - mostly sac@@ char@@ ose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; healthy are the exotic fruits yet : in them contain B vitamins , and vitamins E and C. mainly contain man@@ gan@@ os but much vitamin A and its pre @-@ press beta car@@ otene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who e@@ ats the fruits are supported by means of vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
with the purchase Mang@@ os shouldn &apos;t be too soft or hard and smell pleasantly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the form@@ work color alone does not say anything about it , as ripe fruit is - so also green man@@ gan@@ os can taste delicious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should be stored at room temperature and consumes within less days .
then they taste pure dishes or in sweet foods .
but a man@@ go gives a special note also .
they reli@@ eves the slightly bitter taste of some leaf@@ s such as Chic@@ ore@@ e and radic@@ c@@ cio .

on wed@@ n@@ esday and night to Thursday the Föhn blows up with the storm strength over the valley .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after driving on Thursday in the morning , we cross a striking cold front that brings strong rainfall , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like Met@@ e@@ o@@ News in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive underground area over the British Is@@ les in a vibrant south west stream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Alp@@ enn@@ ord@@ land the night breaks through the valleys through the valleys .
in the follow @-@ up of the hair dryer up to Thursday morning in the con@@ cili@@ ators with bu@@ cks of 60 to 100 km / h . partly in the Ur@@ i province sometimes even with over 100 km / h .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hair dryer can penet@@ rate up into the adjacent centre and on the mountains , even or@@ kan@@ ar@@ ches are possible of over 120 km / h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the north on Wednesday stor@@ my hair dryer for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity of the slope begins to st@@ ew . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here rain stops one who lasts until Thursday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in sum , south of the Alps the next 48 hours of rain must be counted per square meter , having already fallen in the last few days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday morning , Föhn blows off the air that rolls a cold front with strong , partly swe@@ ating rain from West to East over Switzerland . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Rome has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Rome , almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is a Martin Luther Square in Rome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the presence of City President Ig@@ na@@ zio Marino , on Wednesday a nam@@ eless place in the park was christ@@ ened on the name of the German reform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is right in the middle of the ancient Rome beside the Colos@@ se@@ um .
the study was requested by the Protestant Churches of the Protestant Churches in Rome .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome , remin@@ ded that Protest@@ ants could only live in the city of the Pop@@ es over centuries as a minority in secret their faith . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a symbolic way , the tradition of Christian faith is always welcome in Rome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) served as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the year 15@@ 10 / 11 for a few months in Rome .
he found the city back then as a sin @-@ ba@@ bel .
his negative impressions could have led him to view hist@@ ori@@ ans in his later battle against Rome .
Luther then initiated the split in the western Church with his thes@@ es against the las@@ h@@ ese .
hammer artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown is one of the main works , the Ot@@ mar Old has painted his Bible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated the Bible texts .
at the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible that has now been published with magnificent images .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his own personal interpre@@ tations Bi@@ blical stories on paper and canvas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and fan@@ ciful positions has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but not equivalent to &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary : the relevant topics can be quite dark .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about three years Ot@@ mar Alt has worked in his Bible Project , for which he has met a subjective artistic selection from the many topics of the book of all books . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are cycles that reflect on topics like cross , pl@@ agues or f@@ ather@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so spont@@ ane@@ ously he has fascinated several partners : this applies to Luther publishing with its the@@ ological alignment as well as the Kettler @-@ Verlag , with its focus on art books . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost that has been dealt with on the basis of painting with the Bible classes .
he interpre@@ ts the Bible Study by Ot@@ mar &apos;s Old Bible and today translated into current relations . &quot;
these texts are like verbal view of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are embedded between Martin Luther and Martin Luther , and a set of the artist , formulated his own personal thoughts on the situation here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the jewelry clas@@ p has golden letters .
the 75 @-@ year @-@ old is allowing twice a deep insight into his soul and emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , emotions were born in general for the Bible Project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 was born in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ er@@ ode and was born in Berlin in 1940 , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protestant rule . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the education already happened with the cane and re@@ members the Ot@@ mar Alt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work on my way back to the Lord &apos;s father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his second concern was to enhance the art in faster time again : &quot; the perception of pictures is influenced by advertisement , and that is no@@ isy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
symbol@@ ism is being forced .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
images have always something mystery and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I &apos;m a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wish that the viewer can let rise in the images , discover and feel what power they have : &quot; the picture looks for his counter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ r@@ ust had been working on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; Even as &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art . &quot; I like how he can gra@@ sp live with his pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; old don &apos;t desp@@ ise the Bible to complete the Bible , but also selected for him as well as mysterious subjects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was no collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the images , the text explains only . &quot; created a picture bi@@ ble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler by Luther &apos;s Verlag , this plant is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler , both the ( Bi@@ blical ) language of Love and the responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas prints was presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened on November 15th in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
start of construction for BM@@ X train ne@@ ars
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plans made , place found , managed to model ground for a round course : one year later almost everything was done - yet before the official opening of the BM@@ X @-@ Bahn was finished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s@@ sa@@ tions in politics and administration are provided for decay , especially with the residents who did not toler@@ ate the railways . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so hill tow@@ ed up - new place searched - now with formal planning and application on building permission .
the permission will enter in October again . Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee now .
&quot; I hope this year was still visible . &quot; she said .
it should then be started without &quot; further commem@@ oration &quot; with the work of the former swimming pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied commitment to refugees
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the DF@@ B expands its commitment to refugees to 2019 , from Bundes@@ liga to mark a significant sign at the weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football respon@@ ds to the urgent situation in Germany and secu@@ res its help in managing the standing problems .
&quot; I hold this for the greatest challenge in our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no one cannot say in principle , I have nothing to do with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this has to be interested in every single interested in getting this topic in the grip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin .
&quot; I &apos;m next Wednesday at the German Federal Chanc@@ ellery and meet there the Minister of State El@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; the topic will certainly play a central role . &quot; he announced .
the soccer can help and wants to help .
but the decisive turn@@ out must set politics .
the German football club has therefore expanded its Refu@@ gee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a Welcome &quot; by four years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ensured that this programme continues to run until 2019 , &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach explained on the edge of the UEFA conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some states also support this program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already this weekend , the 36 celeb@@ rat@@ ers put a clear sign if it will be put on the left tri@@ kot@@ ary instead of the usual sponsor logo ( Her@@ mes ) the print &quot; We assist &quot; # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help , where and how they can only , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen Sports Chef Rud@@ i Compl@@ et@@ ely appointed the &quot; Picture &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ comprehen@@ sibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee tragedy goes every thing and nobody can see . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are able to help our bodies , no , we must use our beam to help our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ hei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ ail spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the EM qualifying play against Hungary on this Friday , the national team of women will host 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nier@@ s@@ bach marked the support of refugees as &quot; a large community of German football . &quot;
that all 36 license clubs have started their own projects in their sites is magnificent .
equally magnificent is that little and smallest clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a Welcome , &quot; which we spent , is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that is of great importance . &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , the association together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government represents 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the clubs have already called up the entire sum for 2015 and reported Nier@@ s@@ bach .
reports : SAP executive board loses an eye on an accident
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; head of board of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has report@@ edly lost the left eye through a fall of July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the accident at the stairs in the house of his brother in the USA , he fell after midnight on a water glass which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; Economic week &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost bloo@@ d@@ shed and was s@@ wo@@ oned out to the road - that told us so last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder &quot; Has@@ so Pl@@ att@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can follow his work .
&quot; in early October we meet before the meeting of the Supervisory Board at Wall@@ dorf . &quot; said Pl@@ att@@ ner .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was at the meeting and was fully working . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with the German magazine &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung , &quot; he will come back to Germany in October again and will continue to hold the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full of SAP I &apos;m full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I got the whole time in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its President Has@@ so Pl@@ att@@ ner said that Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t said by &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he regularly sw@@ ings between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to public with such a personal history , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can happen that something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s important to stop back when you like . &quot;
McLaren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except combat ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ s a corresponding photo , and explained that he had suffered injury when he &apos;s stran@@ ded from the wheel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he therefore comes in Singapore at the weekend as a spare drive for the two family pilots Fernando Al@@ onso and Jen@@ son Button , like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
football : Bv@@ F with no R@@ EU@@ s against Kra@@ sno@@ dar : turn@@ table in the gate
at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback from Marco R@@ EU@@ s are finally defeated in the first group play of the Europa League .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the national player becomes a table leader of the football league , also in du@@ el with the FR@@ P Kra@@ sno@@ dar on Thursday ( 19@@ .00 / Sky ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; unfortunately we can &apos;t go back on him . &quot; Thomas Tu@@ chel said on Wednesday .
whether R@@ EU@@ s will be back in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ Game to Le@@ verk@@ usen in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ Game : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the high loading of its professionals , Tu@@ chel will not only alter his regular eleven position on the R@@ EU@@ s position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so he announced a change on the door@@ way position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of stem cell Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trains at a top level &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he praised the football teacher the world champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; though Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the future comes into action in all Europe league games , Tu@@ chel has to be open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will also dispute the second game with a high probability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the for@@ ter statement of Mit@@ players R@@ EU@@ s , that the final step in the Bv@@ B will be the target of Julian W@@ eig@@ l for the Bv@@ F in Europe : &quot; so Marco is not so wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think we have a good chance to access the title . &quot;
robot &apos;s cars : government wants leadership for Germany
Germany is supposed to be a pioneer in the change of the Federal Government on the change of cars technological .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the traffic Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which primarily sees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday at Frankfurt on the edge of the car at the IAA in a &quot; new mobility age . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and networked driving will raise the road safety and provide for less stress , said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also wants to discuss the subject with his counter@@ parts from the G7 , which will also come together with representatives of the industry at the IAA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the strategic Department of the Transport Department emphas@@ ises the importance of the mobile broad@@ band building and a meeting point on digital radio technology .
a test track is currently being built on highway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order that the driver &quot; does not need additional liability risks , &quot; the federal government plans to verify the legal framework and , if necessary , adapt to new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , Germany wants to apply for internationally that the permissible speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is raised from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government is also willing to use for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only sees the people as a driver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an automated driving , the car takes over the lead , the driver is becoming more and more passenger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras which process the environment , and process data in seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following a study from the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs , its automated driving on motor@@ ways can be technically possible by 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
still driving vehicles on public roads are expected to be expected only far from 2020 . &quot;
the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the Germany site appreciate the authors of the study by 2025 on approximately 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; digital connectivity of the P@@ k@@ ws may lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD @-@ traffic politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the question of liability for accidents and safety of the personal data of the driver must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
still the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one on Wednesday at the AA pre@@ set survey of the For@@ sa Institute , at the end of the test results , DE@@ K@@ RA will believe that only eight percent of cars in the coming decade are expected to figure 32 percent therefore , 31 percent do not believe in it at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents say to 2025 with autonomous cars , in the US 33 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyway the drivers in Germany are not ready to leave on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a survey of B@@ IT@@ KO@@ M , only seven percent would agree to the control during the entire trip on all roads . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the highway , that would present at least 15 percent in flowing traffic , in St@@ au 45 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
good every fourth would leave the car to control under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team@@ building and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the actual booth , the Du@@ essel@@ dorf intends to only strike on single accounts from 25 September to 4 October . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
final decision is to fall on September 22nd at the latest .
&quot; that is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we &apos;re strong enough to catch the title without Timo the title , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said German head coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ head in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ship in China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo , the down@@ side , we are no longer a clear favorite , &quot; declared single European Champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the lead list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , but also remin@@ ded the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; at that time Timo Scheider was missing - and we are the European champion . &quot;
&quot; we should orient@@ ate ourselves . &quot; explained the world @-@ ranking @-@ one .
the English football player Luke Sha@@ w by Manchester United has taken a serious injury on the right leg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Champions League play at PS@@ V Eindhoven , the def@@ en@@ ders of H@@ é@@ ctor Mor@@ eno was hit and replaced after a long treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for a en@@ f@@ ant
it is a mixture of quite big fashion show and a wax w@@ afer @-@ Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work in Munich on Wednesday .
the highlights : display mannequ@@ ins thanks to video projec@@ tions sho@@ cking human .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they contribute the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designer , which led with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits to the great star of fashion scene - and with that he put men into skirts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t say today that I am the Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it used to be &quot; so@@ oner &quot; it is real &quot; said Gaul@@ tier .
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) which is to be seen from the end of September at the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o @-@ Cultural Foundation from 18 September at the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o @-@ Cultural Foundation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually he had been at the other hand , for : &quot; for me a show was a little bit after death . &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when one dies away one gets to the museum .
the impressive collection was already made in Canadian Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful garments , &quot; said the director of Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ whose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exhibits give an insight into the man &apos;s looking fashion , which has written a fashion story without ever completed a training . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chron@@ ologically the show is not built , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall art work to e@@ ager for the d@@ olls , for example , a styl@@ ist has been committed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 tons of material have been sc@@ anned for the makers according to the curator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , after Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special Sch@@ man@@ ker@@ l : a leather h@@ osen @-@ outfit with cor@@ s@@ ett .
Heidi meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a little different , Gaul@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gaul@@ tier &apos;s old t@@ ed@@ dy is also to be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tender @-@ fashi@@ oned enclos@@ ures of the designer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and badly in football ) , he was attracted to his t@@ ed@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , Gaul@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
playing with a doll would not have allowed him .
the designing of fashion he later taught itself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and applied the designs of other designers like Gaul@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought some of them .
for his first own fashion show he could not pay the models .
they got nothing but could keep the clothes .
jewelry instead of Gar@@ dine - P@@ lau@@ er tip as Fashion @-@ N@@ an
so@@ oner it went to the long st@@ aff@@ i@@ dery in and around P@@ lau@@ en is about to do a meter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the embroi@@ dered materials and tops were produced in great quantity for customers , they were processed for example to ceilings and she@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of Mo@@ desp@@ air P@@ lau@@ en . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead the fashion is important again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the early hours of the P@@ lau@@ ener Sp@@ itz , fashion played a major role , was then forced by home textiles - and is now re@@ discovered as niche . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt gives some examples : top in jewelry , in accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on the frame of the frame , an increase in the time potential . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who don &apos;t have a niche in the textile branch in Germany is no longer on the market .
they already make up half of all the orders with us .
Mo@@ reli@@ ance P@@ lau@@ en is together with nine other companies a member of the P@@ lau@@ er Sp@@ itz and Sti@@ cks .
only they may wear the protected label .
in the last 15 years about 80 percent of the sales were gone away .
there is almost no more shop in retail stores and wholesale .
our products are hardly able to reach our customers in this way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , mass ware is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively about chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also weak exports - currently coming to Russia and the USA .
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tries to score by environmental awareness like C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer , which shows us a quality seal , which shows that we are ec@@ ologically and socially sustainable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the University of Z@@ wick@@ au , diploma designer Andreas Schmidt teaches at the Faculty of Applied Arts in Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroi@@ dery and sp@@ ikes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to match the competition from Asian region they have to find high quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think particularly economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore an existing design is often slightly varied to hold a customer base .

the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .

EU wants to double the Mercury &apos;s limit in space @-@ fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish , thus ensuring a significantly higher dose of the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ ood@@ watch &apos;s consumer organization , which cle@@ ars a corresponding job of the EU , cri@@ tici@@ zed its plans : &quot; risks and adverse events were passed on with full power and small children , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ schmi@@ dt by F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wolf@@ schmi@@ dt says the limits of the nerve blood for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish are raised from one on two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogra@@ m of fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but already today large pre@@ dat@@ ory fishes are already so strong with mercury , that on the basis of the current limit values about 50 percent of the length must not be sold . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after dou@@ bling of the threshold values would be only 5 per cent dec@@ lining .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in return for this relaxing , the EU wants to devour the limit values of other fish of currently 0,5 mg to 0.1 mg of mercury per kilogra@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ ood@@ watch described this however as &quot; trick &quot; , because smaller pi@@ qu@@ ef@@ fish , such as car@@ p are usually low so low that they already en@@ cap@@ sul@@ ated the planned limits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is why the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ ically is therefore a per@@ fi@@ de de@@ fle@@ ction , which alone helps the economy , &quot; said Wolfgang schmi@@ dt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a toxic heavy metal for people who are heavily bombar@@ ded by the food chain especially in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
the Federal Government war@@ ns that &quot; already small quantities especially in inf@@ ant damage of the nervous system can cause damage . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Ministry of Environment declar@@ es on its homepage regarding the valid values , but that &quot; health haz@@ ards of the general population &quot; cannot be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury can be used primarily by coal burning in the environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a written information by the Federal Ministry of Natural Gas , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ corn ordered more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total amount issued in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish about Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; permanent and nationwide , &quot; the &quot; mirror &quot; had been cited in March from the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , European war@@ nings of mercury in fish have already been among the most common health risks in the EU warning system R@@ AS@@ FF . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
