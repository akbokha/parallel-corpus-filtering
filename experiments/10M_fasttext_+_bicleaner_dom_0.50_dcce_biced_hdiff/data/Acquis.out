&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BIS could close the loan agreement with central banks of the credi@@ tor countries , if the banks provide an appropriate request . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the agreement might be concluded until the total amount paid by the credi@@ tor to the mechanism paid , namely within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion € ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery funds of member countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , already some conditions were mentioned below , the BIS would be ready to use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at every stand@@ by credit the BIS would initially take an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extensions stocks , without a total of five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conditions would match those which the BIS would apply to the particular conditions under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market rates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the BIS maintains the required funds on the market , then the rate of interest rate could be a maximum that corresponds to an appropriate margin increased by the rate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you would like to tell me the approval of the Council of the European Communities , I would be grateful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the BIS could close the loan agreement with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks provide an appropriate request .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ear@@ thing carries with it , that the proper application of the agreement is not affected thereby that products from H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat under the agreement will not be executed in agreement with the agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to ensure a perfect function of the agreement , Uruguay is committed to ensure that the amount not exceed the agreed amount and is carried out according to conventional supply forms ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should a change of the offer form as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement should consult one another prior to the introduction of such a change in that under number 10 , in order to find an appropriate solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event that the community takes care of the guar@@ dian cl@@ ause , it obli@@ ges to concern himself to ensure that the access to the common market will not be touched at this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when joining new Member States , the community in consultation with Uruguay is changing the number 2 fixed amount corresponding to the scope of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ ischen trading with any new member state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the import of these new Member States will be charged in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession ; this will be taken into account under the number 5 named Ho@@ ech@@ es of the subscription .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the total number 2 , with the time of Greece &apos;s accession to the community is set to 5 800 tons of batt@@ le@@ body weight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development , which may affect the marketing of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an H@@ amm@@ el and Lamb on the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the Community meets the adher@@ ence to frozen meat on frozen meat due to the implementation of the regulation of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ ish workers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking account of the objectives and regulations of this agreement , the community agree that every actual application of ex@@ tras and lam@@ bs are made only at prices and conditions associated with the existing international obligations in accordance with the existing international obligations in the world trade with these products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , adher@@ ence to this agreement applies in particular to ensure that it is given in the specified quantities of export licenses which are given under number 1 mentioned products within this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community obli@@ ges itself to meet all the necessary precau@@ tions , so that the issu@@ ance of import licence for the above @-@ mentioned products is determined by the template of a compensation license which was awarded by the ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the execution of implementing regulations , the competent administration of the community in the competent area of the community has been reported in regular intervals , to be conclu@@ sive to destination licenses which may be conclu@@ sive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this agreement applies to the areas where the contract is applied to the establishment of the European Economic Community , and to the extent of that contract , and for the territory of the Republic east of Uruguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is recommended to add the shipments to the in@@ fusion required devices , as well as the solvents for dried preparations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
human whole blood is taken to a healthy person and with an adequate anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans missed blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C ) which may not freely depend on blood trans@@ fu@@ sions , as far as this can be ensured by simple medical examination and health care . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blood discharge is as@@ ep@@ tic ; the blood is caused by a closed , ster@@ ile tube system into a ster@@ ile bottle , in which the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant solution was incorporated in front of the steri@@ li@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the end of the blood , the bottle must be removed immediately and cool to a temperature of 4 C to 6 C . thereafter , it may only be opened immediately prior to the use of blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Men@@ gen@@ otype must not be more than 220 ml per litre of human blood , and the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration may not drop to 97 g per liter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the blood group according to the A @-@ B @-@ 0 system is previously determined by hand of blood cells and the ser@@ um ; the provision of the R@@ H factor is performed by exam@@ ining blood cells to a new sample of the don@@ or blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as it is used for blood group determination in individual countries or recommended procedures , these are to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the designation R@@ H @-@ negative is only to be used if specific investigations have the non @-@ exist@@ ent of the anti@@ gens C , D , you and E . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the blood covered in this agreement should only be used for recipi@@ ents of the corresponding AB @-@ 0 Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the human full blood is allowed in ster@@ ile , closed bottle protected from micro@@ organisms and may be allowed to cool at a temperature of 4 to 6 C ; higher temperatures are allowed only during testing and transport necessary , which blood is to cool again to 4 to 6 C at once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a concentrate of human red blood cells is a unity of human whole blood , from which the most part of Plas@@ m has been removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it contains all red blood cells of unity , which has been won ; other blood cells may be present or can be partially removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the liquid content of the concent@@ rates consists of either the rest of the plasma or from an appropriate is@@ otrop@@ ic water @-@ ser@@ y solution based on the distance from Plas@@ mas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the volume of red blood cells should be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , a higher concentration of red blood cells is however to be applied on the label . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all processes necessary for the production need to be done under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the fusion must be made under the use of a ster@@ ile , closed system and exclusively through pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a artificial wat@@ ery solution has been added , so the label is also to give its volume and its composition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the human dry plasma is obtained by drying the liquid , resulting from cent@@ rifu@@ ge or sedi@@ mentation of human blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the human dry plasma is obtained by cooling rock or any other method , by which a den@@ ig@@ ing of proteins is avoided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dry product can easily dissolve in a water quantity , which corresponds to the liquid quantity , from which one went out in the production of substance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
protein concentration of the thus obtained solution may not be less than 45 g per litre and the solution must not have visible signs of hem@@ mol@@ y@@ se@@ products .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tit@@ er gives the di@@ lution of the cage in the final mix within a series , with the micro@@ scop@@ ic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effectiveness of reag@@ ents for blood group determination are present ( for the time anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , may be expressed on the basis of unknown re@@ mun@@ eration in International units ( See Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , so the anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B rate , according to definition 256 International units per ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preparations are available free of charge from the International laboratory for biological standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following table shows an example of a compar@@ ative Tit@@ le of the International standard Anti @-@ A ( S ) and an unknown &quot; anti @-@ A @-@ Re@@ ag@@ enz@@ es ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2B . &gt; P@@ IC F@@ IL@@ E = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 450@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a reag@@ ent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties will remain at least one year long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the exp@@ iry date of a cage in flu@@ ent form according to label is at most a year after the final satisfactory activity test .
the resulting exp@@ iry date for dry reag@@ ents depends on the results of the holding @-@ in tests ; it is appro@@ achable by the government authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drying reag@@ ents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , and in which they have dried and so closed , that no moisture can penet@@ rate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a drying test may lose at most 0,5 BC of his weight if it is tested by further drying of phosph@@ or@@ ben@@ oxy@@ d at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to prevent bacterial growth , the competent authority can determine the anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiot@@ ic delivered to contamination , if the reag@@ ent will continue to provide the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein per ml fluid , or re@@ dissolved ser@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reag@@ ents , in@@ different or after re@@ solution , must be transparent and may not contain sedi@@ ments nor v@@ ables or visible particles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the international exchange of certain reag@@ ents for blood group determination they should not be arti@@ f@@ ici@@ ally colored , at least until an international agreement has come about a unified system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reag@@ ents for blood group determination can be spread in such ways and in such quantities not only to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the amount of quantity should be so big in a container , so that the contents can be used in this protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the manufacturing laboratory has all production stages and controls of reag@@ ents for blood group determination to guide written records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adequate rehear@@ sals of all issued reag@@ ents are as long as possible from the lab board until with some lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood , that the batch will not be used anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substances used for blood group determination can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the necessary auxili@@ aries to strengthen the effectiveness and maintaining the stability of the reag@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for technical reasons , these reag@@ ents are classified according to the origin of their effective bond in three groups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this does not mean that the reag@@ ents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal reag@@ ents are not included in human origin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on each single container a black on white printed label is available in English and French , containing the following details : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 4 . the amount or , with dried re@@ reag@@ ents , the amount and composition of the liquid required for re@@ covering required liquid , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , this label or label on the cardboard box in which the individual containers are in which the individual containers are included : 1 . whole name and address of the manufacturer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
