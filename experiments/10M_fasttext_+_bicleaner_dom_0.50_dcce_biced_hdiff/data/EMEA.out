&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present document is a summary of the European Public Department report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the studies for human medicines will be assessed in order to get recommendations concerning the application of medication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you need further information about your illness or treatment , please read the package directions ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or apply to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you wish more information regarding the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is available as 5 mg / 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) as a solution for inser@@ ting ( 1 mg / ml ) and as a injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B. wir@@ res thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations or interpre@@ ting of things that are not present ) ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , a psych@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des ( periods of abnormal high mood ) alter@@ nat@@ ely with periods of normal mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ bili@@ fy is used for the treatment of severe to severe man@@ ic episodes and for the prevention of man@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des in patients who have addressed in the past to the medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
injection solution is used for rapid control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders when the oral treatment is not possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both ill@@ nesses , the solution can be applied or used to treat melting tablets in patients who trouble the swal@@ lowing of tablets difficulties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients who are using other medicines at the same time , the dose should be adjusted from A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this im@@ pairs signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole seems to be used mainly as a &quot; partial ag@@ onist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters Dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine ( also called ser@@ otonin ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine and dop@@ amine , but in lower dimensions than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain and prevent psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ bili@@ fy , the efficacy of symptoms , was investigated in three trials over one year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effectiveness of injection solution was compared with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar conditions in two studies with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , or similar diseases , over a period of two hours with plac@@ ebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another study A@@ bili@@ fy about twelve weeks at 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the effectiveness of as@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo have been stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy , compared with A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the efficacy of as@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ections was observed in a study on 301 patients with bi@@ polar@@ ised disorder used by Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all studies , the changes in patients received from a standard scale of bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who spoke on treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company also conducted studies through to examine how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution to remove them ( absor@@ bs ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the two trials with injection solution , patients received as@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased un@@ rest than the patients receiving a plac@@ ebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the use of bi@@ polar disorder A@@ bili@@ fy in four of five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms are more effective than plac@@ ebo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ bili@@ fy also hin@@ dered up to 74 weeks , effective as plac@@ ebo the re@@ appeared Man@@ ic Ep@@ iso@@ des in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses have also proven effective as plac@@ ebo the symptoms of ger@@ min@@ ated un@@ rest and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy ( observe at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pol@@ ated py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders ( def@@ ici@@ encies ) , vom@@ iting ( def@@ ici@@ encies ) , sp@@ aci@@ al ( def@@ ici@@ encies ) , suction and fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) and anxiety .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the advantages of as@@ bili@@ fy in treating schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic result in patients suffering from man@@ ic ep@@ raz@@ ors to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to the risks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the Committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of injection solution in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or patients with man@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des occur in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when oral therapy is not suitable against the risks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission approved the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a permit for the transport of as@@ bili@@ fy throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who were mostly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day a day regardless of meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages about a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once a day regardless of the meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y &apos;s efficacy in treating schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of these patients , a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors jus@@ tify this ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the CY@@ P3@@ A4 induction is removed from combination therapy , it should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behaviour is reported to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ec@@ tive disorders , and in some cases prior to the beginning or after change of anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder no increased risk of loss with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( dehy@@ dra@@ tion disorders ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases ( dehy@@ dra@@ tion disorders ) or hyper@@ ton@@ ia ( including ac@@ el@@ ogen@@ ous and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ es@@ ien : in clinical trials which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when treated with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y patients signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occur in consideration , the dose should reduce or break the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a patient emer@@ ge signs and symptoms that has a m@@ ns to indicate or un@@ clear fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all Anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , must be removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used in patients with sei@@ zu@@ res in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese or at states that are used with cra@@ mp@@ ing cases linked to caution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 56 - 99 years old associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psych@@ osis who were treated with the Alzheimer &apos;s disease , an increased risk of death in comparison to plac@@ ebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in one of these studies , a study with fi@@ xer dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to un@@ intended cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia , in some cases extremely and associated with eto@@ azi@@ de or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no precise risk assessment for hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia @-@ related events associated with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , which allow direct compar@@ isons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy ( poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in relation to deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , a weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ens patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics that gain weight gain as a side effect , and could lead to serious complications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally @-@ effective medicines such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the H2 ant@@ agonist fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a ga@@ stri@@ c @-@ block@@ ers , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , although this effect is regarded as clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical trial with healthy volunteers , a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole to 107 % , while the C@@ max remained unchanged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , like Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects have , and therefore should similar dose reductions to be performed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; Po@@ or &apos; ) Met@@ abol@@ is@@ ier@@ ans can result in the common application using highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 into higher plasma concentration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in comparison to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you take the joint gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefit should weigh the potential risks for the patient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , like I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV @-@ protein inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects , and therefore similar doses should be made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after placing the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 In@@ hibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the dose height prior to the companion therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
di@@ az@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y will be given together with an excessive increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
clinical trials showed doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ methodology ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( Om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be advised to notify your doctor if they are pregnant or a pregnancy , during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to insufficient data protection for humans and due to recur@@ ring studies , this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy , unless possible benefits does clearly jus@@ tify the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , patients should be warned against other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics that have been warned to operate dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole does not have any negative influence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally @-@ related side effects ( * ) :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frequency of the side @-@ related side effects is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 25.@@ 8 % ) from EPS including par@@ in@@ son@@ ism , ac@@ ath@@ ic and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia against patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study for over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % was under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lanz@@ ap@@ in therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Man@@ ic Ep@@ iso@@ des in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled trial over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % was among patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was diagnosed with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the long @-@ term phase of over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for plac@@ ebo treated patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a comparison between the patient groups below Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters came up , showed no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
enh@@ ancements of the C@@ p@@ k ( cre@@ atine phosph@@ ating kin@@ ase ) generally observed temporarily and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atically , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , belong to the adverse effects associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tionally not@@ ices with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole alone was observed with an estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there are no information on the effectiveness of a hem@@ ost@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dos@@ ing with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , however , it is unlikely that hem@@ ost@@ aly@@ sis has a high plasma rotation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is pres@@ umed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated on a combination of a partial sens@@ ory effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and a ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 recep@@ tor and the ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for the ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ er@@ gen and the hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recept@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in dos@@ ages from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers showed a dos@@ is@@ cent target reduction of the bond of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 recep@@ tor @-@ lig@@ ands , on the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the Put@@ amen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significantly stronger improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol study , 52 % of patients respon@@ ding to study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current values from measuring shelves , which were defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depression scale , showed significantly stronger improvement than at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia showed a significantly higher reduction of the return rate , which amounted to 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % among plac@@ ebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study included in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia ( N = 18 or 13 % of the most valuable patients ) in significantly less patients ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg in average weight ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with a more flexible dosage of 3 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was compared to plac@@ ebo over 3 weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior effectiveness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in two plac@@ ebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trials over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ fault , with or without psych@@ otic features , it was comparable to that of lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole also showed a comparable share of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the mania on how lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial of 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed a superior effectiveness in the reduction of chronic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase spann@@ ing a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , predominantly in the prevention of a bi@@ polar return , mainly in the prevention of a bi@@ polar return . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on in vitro studies , the CY@@ P3@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the dehy@@ dra@@ tion and hydro@@ xy@@ lation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , which is cataly@@ zes by CY@@ P3@@ A4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the mean Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole with extensive metabol@@ ites for CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and at approximately 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism over CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .

AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injection solution is used for quick control of immun@@ o@@ gi@@ dity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be completed and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to minimize the absorption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep in the glut@@ eus @-@ maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under conversion of adi@@ p@@ ous regions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a lower dose of 5,@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) depends on the individual clinical status taking into account which has already been given to the approximate or acute therapy ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ es@@ ien : in clinical trials which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
clinical trials of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle rigi@@ dity , variable levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ating and heart rhythm disorders ) .
Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy ( poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gie and weakness ) are observed and patient with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in relation to deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , a weight gain is observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ an patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect and could lead to serious complications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was greater compared to the only gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study in the healthy subjects of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) and simultaneously received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg doses ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

107 The following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) as under plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see Section 5.1 ) :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study for over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % was under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was diagnosed with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe retinal specimens , a similar efficacy was observed on the overall population , but a statistical significance was observed due to a reduced patient number . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significantly stronger improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol study , 52 % of patients respon@@ ding to study medication is similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ) and hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a main study , in which 460 women participated with metastatic breast cancer , of which approximately three quarters had obtained a Anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole discretion ) was compared to a conventional Pac@@ lit@@ a@@ xel ( given in combination with other medicines for reducing the side effects ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 with Abra@@ x@@ ane patients were treated in the treatment , compared with 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients , which contained conventional Pac@@ lit@@ a@@ xel drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering only the patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there were no difference between pharmaceuticals and survival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , patients showed other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer in relation to these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane acted as conventional Pac@@ lit@@ a@@ xel as conventional drug . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it must not be applied in patients who have low neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ es in the blood before the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the drug for human medicines ( CH@@ MP ) proved that Abra@@ x@@ ane contained the first treatment more effectively than conventional Pac@@ lit@@ a@@ xel , and that it has to be given more effective than other pac@@ lit@@ a@@ xel foods to reduce side effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from January 2008 , the European Commission approved Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited on the basis of the basis of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with which the first @-@ line therapy for metastatic breast cancer is not shown and is not displayed in a standard Anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine therapy ( see also Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with severe neutr@@ rop@@ ia ( neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ en@@ ium &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sens@@ orial neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at sens@@ ory Neu@@ rop@@ athy Grad , 3 is the treatment to inter@@ rupt until an improvement is reached on degree 1 or 2 , and with all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tations in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were no studies involving patients with im@@ paired ren@@ al function , and there are currently no sufficient data on patients with impair@@ ment of the ren@@ al function ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to non @-@ sufficient data for imp@@ em@@ ability and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bent nan@@ op@@ ar@@ ist formulation of pac@@ lit@@ a@@ xel to be used as other pharmac@@ ological characteristics as other formu@@ lations by pac@@ lit@@ a@@ xel ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and the patient may not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ a@@ xel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients no longer Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be followed up until the neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ ation number rose again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l , and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ oming count rose again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with heavy liver function ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while an un@@ equi@@ vocal cardi@@ om@@ in@@ arity was not proven , kar@@ di@@ als inci@@ dental inci@@ dents are not unusual , especially in patients with early Anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or ar@@ ching heart disease or lung disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of patients after the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane nausea , vom@@ iting and diarr@@ he@@ a , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ tive means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not to be prac@@ tised by pregnant women or women in a poor age which does not practise an effective contra@@ c@@ eption that does not apply to the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ a@@ xel turns unavoid@@ able .
women in the age @-@ capable age should apply during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane a reliable contra@@ cep@@ tive method .
male patients who will be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane is advised to bear a child for up to six months after treatment .
male patients should advise themselves before the treatment of a sperm con@@ tours until the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can impact on the traffic and the ability to serve machines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of adverse events observed in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated in the pi@@ v@@ ot@@ al clinical Phase III study every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was the most striking important hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( 79 % of patients reported ) and was quick reversible and dos@@ is@@ dependent ; Leu@@ k@@ open@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients with Abra@@ x@@ ane patients and was severe ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Table 1 , the side effects are specified , which occurred in conjunction with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy for each dose and indication ( N = 7@@ 89 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tic acid in the blood , increased phosph@@ orus in the blood , increased phosph@@ orus in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood of heart disease : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gie , blo@@ ating , tongue burning , dry mouth , pain in op@@ hag@@ us , ul@@ cers in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding , rec@@ tal bleeding , kidneys and ur@@ inary tract : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pain in the chest wall , weakness of muscles , abdominal pain , sore throat , pain in limbs , muscle weakness , very common : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rest@@ less@@ ness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity will be calculated based on a defini@@ tive case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no caus@@ al correlation was established with these events . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pac@@ lit@@ a@@ xel is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules that promotes the combination of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ bel@@ s and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by in@@ hibition of their de@@ formation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this stabili@@ zation leads to a in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ in im@@ it@@ ates the trans@@ cy@@ t@@ osis of plasma components into the end@@ othel@@ ial cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in has been promoting the transport of pac@@ lit@@ a@@ xel by the end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved trans@@ end@@ othel@@ ial transport by the GP @-@ 60 @-@ Alb@@ ume recep@@ tor is communicated and caused by an Pac@@ lit@@ a@@ xel accumulation in c@@ yst@@ eine ) in c@@ yst@@ eine in c@@ yst@@ eine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by the data of 106 patients , in two single @-@ blind studies and from 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ised Phase III compar@@ ative study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study there were 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion about 30 minutes on 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this multi @-@ cent@@ ric study was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer diagnosed with pac@@ lit@@ a@@ xel 75 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with relief of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ treatment ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
during inclusion in the study 64 % of patients had an im@@ paired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) ; 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 % of patients had previously received chemotherapy , 27 % had only a adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metastatic breast and a adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 9 . the results for the general response and time to progres@@ sion of the disease as well as progres@@ sion @-@ free survival and survival for patients who received &gt; First @-@ Line therapy , are shown below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity against pac@@ lit@@ a@@ xel was evaluated by a degree of patients who were evaluated during a period during therapy , periph@@ eral Neu@@ rop@@ athy Grad 3 were evaluated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the natural course of periph@@ eral re @-@ emp@@ athy for bas@@ eline regarding the cum@@ ulative Tox@@ icity by Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown .
the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total @-@ pac@@ lit@@ a@@ xel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions from Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the process exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml , with a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
10 After intraven@@ ous treatment of Abra@@ x@@ ane patients with metastatic breast cancer at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 the pac@@ lit@@ a@@ xel plasma concentration took place in multi@@ ph@@ as@@ sic ways .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to an extensive ex@@ trav@@ ascular distribution and / or gra@@ zing connection of pac@@ lit@@ a@@ xel .
in a study of patients with advanced solid tum@@ ours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ a@@ xel were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 175 mg / m2 weighing approximately 175 mg / m2 of sol@@ vent containing Pac@@ lit@@ a@@ xel .
the Pac@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ a@@ xel was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane administration higher ( 43 % ) than after a sol@@ vent containing Pac@@ lit@@ a@@ xel injection and the deployment volume was above Abra@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in published literature about in @-@ vitro studies of the human liver micro@@ some and fabric coatings , pac@@ lit@@ a@@ xel appears primarily to be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed ( 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ a@@ xel and 6@@ 000@@ -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ a@@ xel ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer diagnosed with fewer than 1 % of the used total dose with fewer than 1 % of the metabolism of the Met@@ abol@@ ite 6@@ 65 -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ a@@ xel and 3 &quot; -@@ p Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ a@@ xel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , over the age of over 75 years , only a few data are available , since only 3 patients participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical and physical stability was proved at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and light @-@ protected light over 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ a@@ xel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ carcin@@ ogen@@ ic drug and as well as other potentially toxic substances should be maintained when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane caution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using a ster@@ ile sy@@ ringe , inj@@ ected slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chloride in@@ fusion solution into a Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ breaking bottle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the complete en@@ core of the solution , the tube should rest for at least 5 minutes to guarantee a good benchmark . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then the tube for a minimum of 2 minutes should be slow and carefully sli@@ pped and / or in@@ vert , until a complete re@@ board of the powder is done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if f@@ ake or inc@@ ts are visible , the water bottle must be gently repaired to achieve a complete re@@ board before the application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exact total dos@@ is@@ volume of the 5 mg / ml suspension is calculated for the patient and inj@@ ected into an empty , ster@@ ile PV@@ C@@ - or non @-@ PVC in@@ fusion bag . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

• Training @-@ brochure • summary of the characteristics of the medicine by means of a clear imaging of the product &apos;s correct use of the product re@@ filled cooling boxes for transport by the patient .
this means that di@@ aling is similar to a biological medicine that has already been approved in the European Union ( EU ) and the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; reference drug &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is used in patients with normal blood @-@ fer@@ rous complications , which may occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complications before the procedure is an self @-@ bleeding not possible and with which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; treatment with se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor , which has experience in the treatment of patients with disorders , which is indicated for the medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make an self @-@ bleeding , Ab@@ se@@ amed into a V@@ ene is inj@@ ected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
injection can also be carried out by the patient or the care subject if they have received appropriate instruction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients who have received chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ anting in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the iron values of all patients are before treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists , and iron comple@@ xes should be administered during the entire treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients who receive chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an an@@ emia can be caused by a er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ deficiency , or thereby that the body is not sufficient for the body &apos;s own er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell that has been introduced into a gene ( DNA ) which works for the formation of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by appointment as an injection , ab@@ out@@ amed into a v@@ ene in the framework of a main study of 4@@ 79 patients caused by kidney problems caused by reference medicines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all patients participating in this study were at least eight weeks later , E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o had been inj@@ ected into a V@@ ene prior to them or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
main indicator for efficacy was the change of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the company provided the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin were inj@@ ected using the ones of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o with 114 cancer patients received chemotherapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study of patients who caused by kidney problems caused by kidney problems , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ ds were transferred to the same extent as with those patients who continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in comparison with this , the patients continued to get E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , an increase of 0.@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl at the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most frequent side effect of se@@ is@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure that can occasionally lead to symptoms of cep@@ hal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , craw@@ ling head@@ aches and confusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed must not be used in patients , which may be excessive ( allergic ) against epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; se@@ is@@ amed as inj@@ ections under the skin is not recommended for treatment of kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that no allergic reactions are caused . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the drug has been provided with a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile , such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company , the se@@ is@@ amed , will provide information relating to medical specialists in all Member States and provide information about the safety of the drug . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except for pedi@@ at@@ ric patients suffering from 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; symptoms and tor@@ tures can vary depending on age , gender and total disease of disease ; therefore , the assessment of individual clinical practice and disease resistance is necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a rise in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ins to be more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can occasionally be observed with or under the hem@@ og@@ glo@@ bin@@ - target concentration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of these hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tempted to achieve hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the hem@@ og@@ glo@@ omy contains more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) exceeds the ep@@ ox@@ in al@@ fa dose to reduce 25 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is required in the lowest permitted dose , which is applied to control an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initial low H@@ b @-@ value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher conservation of patients ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be close mes@@ hed in order to ensure that Epo@@ et@@ tin al@@ fa is in the lowest permitted dose , which is applied to control the an@@ tic@@ ancer symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if after 4 treatment weeks of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reverse os@@ copy ratio of ≥ 40.000 cells / µ@@ l per week or 450 kg / kg per week should be retained once a week .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / l ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the reverse os@@ copy of &lt; 40.000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial level has to be raised to 300 Hz / kg three times a week .
if after additional 4 treatment weeks with 300 Mb / kg three times a week of hem@@ og@@ glo@@ bet@@ r@@ ong around ≥ 1 g / l ( ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reverse os@@ copy number by ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ( ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reverse os@@ copy number by ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ( ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reverse os@@ copy ratio should be retained by 300 mg / kg three times a week .

patients with a slight an@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) in which the pre@@ ventive inv@@ itations of ≥ 4 blood @-@ conservative is required should be deduc@@ ed in a dose of 600 i.e. / kg body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks before the surgical procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the Iron sub@@ stitution , as early as possible - for example , a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood test program - can be started so before the start of the se@@ amed therapy great iron reserves are available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 g / kg ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the operational procedure and the day of the intervention ( day 0 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients who are intended to participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous cardi@@ ac procedure , the application of ep@@ ox@@ ic cardi@@ ac disease is contra@@ indicated : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , periph@@ eral arter@@ ial disease , periph@@ eral disease , vas@@ cul@@ ary heart attack , or cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular event . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Er@@ y@@ th@@ rob@@ ber@@ open@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely has been reported on the appearance of an anti@@ static PR@@ CA to mon@@ ate@@ - to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with sudden action loss , defined as a reduction in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 @-@ 2 g / dl per month ) and the usual causes of failure ( iron , fol@@ lic@@ acid or vitamin B12 deficiency , infections or infections , blood loss and hem@@ mol@@ y@@ se ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the reag@@ ent value , taking into consideration of an@@ emia ( i.e. the reverse u@@ lo@@ cytes &quot; index &quot; ) , the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ b@@ tin and leu@@ k@@ zy@@ ten@@ ds are determined , and if no other reason of active loss should be considered ( &lt; 20.000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20.000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0.5 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
data for immun@@ ogen@@ icity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous application of se@@ amed patients with a risk for an anti @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 8 In cases of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , this should not exceed the recommended upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration in section 4.2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials , an increased mortality risk and risk of severe cardiovascular disease ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; controlled clinical trials have shown no significant benefit , which is attri@@ but@@ able to the gift of ep@@ ox@@ ins and the prevention of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions and prevention of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions is increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hem@@ og@@ low rise should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of high blood pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clinical evidence which should not be exceeded under Section 4.2 , the lower limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in disease should not be exceeded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to present knowledge , it is not accelerated by the treatment of an@@ emia with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa in adults with kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not accelerated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with cancer patients should be taken into account for the assessment of therapy efficiency of ep@@ her@@ tin al@@ fa a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa &apos;s gift and the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin response ( patients who may have trans@@ fun@@ gible ) .
if the H@@ b increase is greater than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) which is necessary to minimize the risk of possible thro@@ mb@@ otic events ( see section 4.2 of patients with in@@ sti@@ p@@ ected an@@ emia / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision for the application re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk reduction in the patient &apos;s participation , which should also consider the specific clinical context . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients who are intended for a greater electric orthop@@ a@@ edic procedure , if possible , before the ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa therapy the cause of an@@ emia should be studied and treated accordingly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients who accompanied themselves to a greater electric or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic procedure , should have an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic and v@@ ascular diseases , particularly with a wor@@ ship@@ able cardiovascular disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it cannot be excluded that with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa for patients with a starting point of &gt; 13 g / dl provides an increased risk of postoperative thro@@ mb@@ otic / vas@@ cul@@ ular events . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ine was not proven that they can reduce the overall survival or reduce the risk of tumor progres@@ sion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in @-@ vitro examination , there are no indications on a interaction between ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM CS@@ F with regard to hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the most common adverse effect during treatment with ep@@ ox@@ al@@ fa is a dos@@ is@@ tive increase in blood pressure or deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ ton@@ ia .
an increased incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ vas@@ cul@@ ular events ( see section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients under the treatment of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regardless of the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treatment , surgical patients with cardiovascular disease can occur after repeated blood donations to thro@@ mb@@ otic and vas@@ cul@@ ular complications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the genetically modified Epo@@ et@@ tin al@@ fa is identical to the amino acids and carbohydrates of carbohydrates , identical to the end@@ ogen@@ ous human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells , that ep@@ her@@ tin al@@ fa stimulates the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and the leu@@ cop@@ ogen@@ esis is not affected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

survival and progres@@ sion @-@ progres@@ sion were examined in five major controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin patients and patients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin showed a clari@@ fying , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality than with the controls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ osis and related complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin patients and with controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ lic events of tumor patients who are treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin , and a negative effect on the overall survival cannot be excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not clear how far this results can be transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin , using chemotherapy , as a few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa provisions after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy volunteers and an extended half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the ser@@ um levels of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa are much lower than the ser@@ um levels that are reached after intraven@@ ous injection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no cum@@ ulation : the ser@@ um levels remain the same , regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 In experimental studies with close to 20@@ s of the adoption of subjects recommended by man , ep@@ her@@ tin al@@ fa led to dimin@@ ished federal weight , with a delay of os@@ si@@ fication and an increase in killing mortality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these reports rely on in vitro studies with cells from human tumor tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; def@@ ici@@ encies , dis@@ solution of red blood cells ( hem@@ mol@@ y@@ se ) , blood pressure , vitamin B@@ 12 or Fol@@ aci@@ dic deficiency , should take into account and be treated prior to treatment with dis@@ courses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very rarely has been reported on the appearance of an antique semi @-@ rob@@ ber@@ open@@ ia after mon@@ ate@@ - to years of sub@@ cut@@ aneous treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin spec@@ kled ) er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you suffer from Er@@ y@@ th@@ rob@@ ber@@ open@@ ia , it will break your therapy with dis@@ ma@@ tions and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia will be treated best . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , se@@ is@@ amed through injection into a v@@ ene ( intraven@@ ously ) must be given if you are treated because of an an@@ emia due to a kidney disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a high hem@@ og@@ glo@@ omy contains the risk of problems with heart or blood vessels , and the death of death could be increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for increased or increasing potassium , your doctor may take an inter@@ ruption of treatment with dis@@ ma@@ tions until the potassium values are back in the norm range . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney illness and clin@@ ically apparent cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror will not exceed a particular value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the present knowledge , it is not accelerated by the treatment of bleeding in adults with chronic kidney disease ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not accelerated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa &apos;s gift and the desired effect should be taken into account for the evaluation of the effectiveness of se@@ eding needs .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust their deri@@ ving dose accordingly to keep the risk of blood c@@ rop@@ ing formation ( thro@@ mb@@ otic event ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this risk should be carefully weigh@@ ed from the treatment with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa drugs , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ ot@@ eric v@@ ascular events ( e.g. a deep cl@@ esi@@ osis or pne@@ em@@ bo@@ lie ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case you are cancer patients , consider that se@@ dent@@ als work as a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances may affect the tumor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a major orthop@@ edic operation is im@@ min@@ ated , the treatment of your an@@ a@@ emia should be studied and treated accordingly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get dis@@ ma@@ tions as there is an increased risk of hem@@ orr@@ ha@@ formation after surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines / apply or used recently , even if it is not prescri@@ ption drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you take Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to suppression the immune system ) during your therapy with se@@ is@@ amed , your doctor may apply certain blood tests to measure blood levels of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
laboratory investigations have shown no interaction between ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F ) and GM CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F ) and GM CS@@ F ( for example with cancer or HIV ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on how your blood cl@@ ergy ( an@@ emia ) is related to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted for about every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if necessary , your doctor will examine regular blood tests to check the treatment success and ensure that the medicine works correctly and does not exceed a particular value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you are well set , you will receive regular doses of se@@ amed between 25 and 50 i.e. / kg twice weekly , distributed on two equally large inj@@ ections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if necessary , your doctor will examine regular blood tests to check the treatment success and ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on how the an@@ emia should apply to treatment , the dose may be adjusted for approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure this and ensure that the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the treated doctor will perform regular blood tests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is necessary to sh@@ orten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 i.e. / kg can be given at 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of the intervention and another 4 days after the surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , you can , if your doctor holds this for appropriate , also learn how to splash out the skin under the skin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

eyel@@ ids and lips ( Qu@@ in@@ cke @-@ Ö@@ dem ) and shock @-@ like allergic reactions with symptoms such as cri@@ b@@ bles , redness , it@@ ching and accelerated pulse have been reported in rare cases .
Er@@ y@@ th@@ rob@@ ber@@ open@@ ia means that no more sufficient red blood cells in the bone mar@@ row can be formed ( see section &quot; Special pru@@ dence in the use of se@@ is@@ amed is required &quot; ) .
after repeated blood donations it may come - regardless of the treatment with se@@ dent@@ als ( thro@@ mb@@ otic v@@ ascular events ) .
treatment with se@@ dent@@ als can occur with an increased risk of hem@@ orr@@ ha@@ ge after surgery ( postoperative thro@@ mb@@ otic v@@ ascular events ) when your starting point is too high .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or if you notice side effects that are not listed in this user information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a sy@@ ringe has been taken from the fridge and the room temperature has been reached ( up to 25 ° C ) , it must be used either within 3 days or rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease which makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ opause and in men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is applied to patients with a high risk of risk ( bone frac@@ tures ) , including patients who recently suffered a small trau@@ matic shift in the bone ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone has changed the normal course of bone growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 m@@ g. of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a great dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first in@@ fusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta can reduce symptoms of symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ ache . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for treating the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta may only be prescribed by doctors , experience in treating this disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was attracted to ass@@ essing Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first study almost 8 000 older women were involved with o@@ steopor@@ osis , and the number of verteb@@ rates and hip frac@@ tures were examined over a period of three years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second study included 2 127 male women and women with o@@ steopor@@ osis over 50 years , who recently investigated a hill frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta has been tested in two studies involving 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main indicator of the efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in the ser@@ um ( an enzyme , the bone substance ) , norm@@ alized or reduced at least 75 % compared to the initial value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study with older women , the risk of verteb@@ rates in patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( excluding other o@@ steopor@@ osis ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared to people suffering from Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other o@@ steopor@@ osis ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 from 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the side effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion , and are less frequent with repeated in@@ fu@@ sions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ac@@ la@@ sta may not be used in patients who may be sensitive ( allergic ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ric acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates patients at Ac@@ la@@ sta &apos;s risk of kidney problems , reactions on the in@@ fusion and ste@@ el@@ on@@ dro@@ se ( extin@@ ction of bone tissue ) in pine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the manufacturers of Ac@@ la@@ sta provide clari@@ fying material for physi@@ cians who use Ac@@ la@@ sta to treat o@@ steopor@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients who explains the side effects of the drug and referred to it as if they should consult the doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in April 2005 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ arti@@ s Europ@@ em@@ as Limited a permit for the transport of Ac@@ la@@ sta in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and men with an increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently noted low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • The packing of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , Non @-@ smoking signs and symptoms of severe side effects • When on medical or nursing aid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis • post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with an increased risk of frac@@ tures included in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis and o@@ steopor@@ osis in men , an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg ac@@ la@@ sta is once a year recommended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after surgical care is recommended ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors , experience in the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment was observed in patients who have addressed the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate supply of calcium , correspon@@ d@@ ingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with a recently noted low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 , i.e. oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incidence of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , can be reduced shortly after the use of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with kidney interference ( see section 4.4 ) In cases of patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended as a limited clinical experience for these patient group is available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elim@@ ination in elderly patients is similar to younger ones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children and young people Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , because data is missing for the in@@ concei@@ vable and effectiveness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because of these patient population only limited clinical experiences .
an existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is used prior to treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta by adequate supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to rapid inhal@@ ation of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ric acid on bone mar@@ um@@ ine , a temporary , mit@@ ogen symp@@ tom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia may develop , usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta . ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate supply of calcium , correspon@@ d@@ ingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cancer disease ( chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid arthritis , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid arthritis ) should be considered a dental examination with a reasonable relief valve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for patients receiving dental handles , no data are available whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduce the risk of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sen in jaw areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clinical assessment by the treatments doctor should be based on each patient &apos;s treatment plan , and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incidence of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , can be reduced shortly after the use of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the overall incidence of adverse adverse events was increased by patients who received Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) in comparison to patients with plac@@ ebo ( 0.6 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the o@@ steopor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ c@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was comparable to total circulation between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kidney distur@@ b@@ ance Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid was associated with kidney function , which is in combination of the kidney function ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance ( measured every year before administration ) and the occurrence of kidney function as well as a restricted kidney function , were similar to o@@ steopor@@ osis over three years between the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the plac@@ ebo group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a temporary increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of gift was observed with 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta patients compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the evaluation of the laboratory so@@ res , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values showed up to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all patients received adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study on post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis , in the study on avoiding clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study on avoiding clinical frac@@ tures after a recently lap@@ id@@ ated hip frac@@ ture , the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local reactions After accept@@ ing Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in a large clinical study was reported about local reactions at the in@@ fusion agency , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen in the jaw range was artic@@ ulated above all in cancer patients , above O@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen ( primarily in the jaw range ) , with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , including c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of these patients had signs for local infections including O@@ ste@@ omyel@@ itis , and the majority of the reports apply to cancer patients to dental tra@@ ctions or other dental attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7 study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients joined O@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ ros@@ is in the jaw area with Ac@@ la@@ sta and with plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of over@@ dos@@ ing , which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , can be obtained by the gift of oral calcium and / or a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed up with Ac@@ la@@ sta patients in comparison to plac@@ ebo a increase of the tra@@ ins@@ ular bone volume and the receipt of the tra@@ ins@@ ular bone architecture .
bone @-@ related alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) in ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C @-@ T@@ elop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ X ) in ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C @-@ T@@ elop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ X ) in ser@@ um were determined in sub @-@ groups from 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 246 patients in periodic@@ ally intervals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Ac@@ la@@ sta decreased by 30 % compared to initial output and was held at 28 % below the initial value for up to 36 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the initial value for up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ X has been significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value for up to 36 months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vitamin D mirrors were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 , oral or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the treated group , compared with 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
effect on the bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) in the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study increased the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment compared to plac@@ ebo @-@ treatment for BM@@ D at the overall heat and sna@@ kes .
the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment conducted over 24 months in comparison to plac@@ ebo @-@ treatment to an increase of BM@@ D by 5.4 % on the overall heat and 4,3 % at the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ eck .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study were random@@ ized , and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures amounted to 7.5 % in Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated males compared to 8.@@ 7 % for plac@@ ebo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another study by men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once annual administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta was given to the percentage change of lum@@ bar BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
clinical efficacy of treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ la@@ sta has been examined in patients with radi@@ ologically confirmed earlier ( mean ser@@ um levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase correspon@@ d@@ ingly to 2.@@ 6@@ x up to 3.@@ 0@@ ies @-@ specific upper level taken in the study ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid compared to taking 30 m@@ g. of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day during 2 months , was demonstrated in two six months of comparison studies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the combined results , a similar decrease in pain relief and pain control was observed in comparison to the initial value for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients , which were classified by six months as a result of the six @-@ month trial ( applied to therapy ) , could be included in a follow @-@ up phase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the 143 with Ac@@ la@@ sta and 107 with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate patients , the therapeutic approach could be treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta , compared with 71 patients treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron treatment , compared with a mean duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fu@@ sions from 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ric acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data that proved to be dos@@ is@@ independent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , the plasma level decreased rapidly to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
surprise bi@@ ph@@ as@@ sic dis@@ appearance of the big cycle with half @-@ life cycle t ½ -@@ 0.@@ 24 and t ½ . 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a long elim@@ ination phase with a season of elim@@ ination stages of ½ g 146 hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the early stages of distribution ( α and β , with the above @-@ called ½ -@@ values ) represent a rapid res@@ or@@ ption in bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the adult dose , while the rest is bound to bone tissue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the total body @-@ Clear@@ ance is irrespective of the dose 5.0 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an extension of the in@@ fusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration at time ) .
a reduced clearing of metabolic syndrome is unlikely to met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 substances and because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed because it is a weak or even direct and / or ir@@ reversible , active inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearing of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance and in the 64 evaluated patients in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this makes it possible that a light ( Cl@@ one = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al interference up to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tion of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since heavy kidney interference ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) is only limited , no conclusions are possible for this population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
acute tox@@ icity The highest non @-@ acting intraven@@ ous single dose amounted to 10 mg / kg of body weight and at rats 0.6 mg / kg of body@@ weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in dogs , individual doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C ) were given the 6@@ fold of the recommended humane therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without ren@@ al influence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chronic and chronic tox@@ icity studies with intraven@@ ous application was administered at intervals of 2 times a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , administered in intervals of 2- 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulated dose , which applies to the 7@@ x of the Human @-@ therapeutic exposure , relative to AU@@ C , corresponds to ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in cum@@ ulated expos@@ ures , which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , including the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as at the intraven@@ ous injection site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most frequent occurrence in studies with repeated use was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ se of the long bone with animals in the growth phase with virtually all dos@@ ages , a result reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of sub@@ st@@ anz@@ as , which is called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate and is used for the treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , o@@ steopor@@ osis in men and the Mor@@ se Pa@@ get of the bone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , predominantly o@@ est@@ ro@@ gens , which are formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in a rather progressive loss of bone mass who is observed in men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , the bone structure is too fast , and new bone material is subjected to sub@@ ordin@@ ate which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ la@@ sta has a effect in norm@@ alized bone formation , ensuring normal bone formation and thus gives the bone again giving strength . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are in dental treatment or to undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you will be treated using Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when applying Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff when using other medicines or used recently , even if it is not prescri@@ ption drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are using medicine , which is known by the kidneys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when applying Ac@@ la@@ sta along with food and drink , you worry that you will be sufficient liquid before and after the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
o@@ steopor@@ osis is the usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is given to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you have broken the hip , it is recommended to take the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after surgical care . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg , which is given to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Ac@@ la@@ sta has worked for a long time , you may need a further dose until one year or longer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to follow these instructions , so that the calcium mirror in your blood is not too low in the period following the in@@ fusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can work longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if administration was missed by Ac@@ la@@ sta , you will get in touch with your doctor or hospital in order to make a new appointment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion occur very often ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequent after the subsequent in@@ fusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fever and ch@@ ills ; muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches that occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently it is un@@ clear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should notice it to your doctor if you have received such symptoms when you get Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with a short @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , patients are advised to make the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical care of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before and after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta patients need to be sufficient with fluid , this is particularly important in patients who receive di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , four trials over 7 000 patients were conducted in which A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA was used as a supporting means for setting the smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to study on smoking , no uniform results showed that the effect of A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA was difficult to assess on this application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

abstract of the EP@@ AR for the public : the present document is a summary of the European Public Direc@@ torate ( EP@@ AR ) which explains how the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) is discussed in order to get recommendations concerning the application of medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used for treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can not be used in patients ( in particular overweight patients ) . • It can be used together with another di@@ ab@@ et@@ ric medicine ( du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can also be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( in particular overweight patients ) , which can not be satisfactory in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in combination with a Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ resin material or insulin , the old dose of the sul@@ fa drugs and insulin can be reduced compared to patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should be reduced to the dose of the sul@@ fa drugs and the insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the body &apos;s body is better utilized and the blood sugar level drops , which allows Type 2 diabetes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with more than 1 400 patients , the effectiveness of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy was investigated , thereby the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ phi@@ l resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the studies the concentration of a substance in blood ( gly@@ co@@ axial hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which shows how good blood sugar is adjusted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that blood sugar levels were lowered by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the Tri@@ ple@@ a study , the effect of the additional treatment of Ac@@ tos to the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fo@@ lic wa@@ vy showed up 0.@@ 94 % , while the extra gift of plac@@ ebo resulted in a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin were examined in 289 patients , the patients received additional insulin amounts of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in patients who also took plac@@ ebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common adverse events related to ac@@ tos were vision disorders , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain , and hy@@ po@@ es@@ thes@@ ia ( dimin@@ ished sensitivity to irritation ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos should not be used in patients who may be sensitive to patients ( allergic ) to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ abe@@ tic cal@@ ve@@ tia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients , where met@@ form@@ in is not displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited authori@@ zation of account of the account of Ac@@ tos in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white until whi@@ tish , round , curved and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with insulin for patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is insufficient and in@@ adequ@@ ately ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore application is not recommended in this age group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients who develop at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , weight gain or o@@ ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiovascular reserve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , weight gain and o@@ ede@@ ma when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is used in combination with insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a cardiovascular out@@ come study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ rov@@ ascular illness was performed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this study , an increase in reports of con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure - which however did not lead to an increase in mortality rate in the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in patients with increased output liver enzymes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the norm ) or with other signs of liver disease may not be used as Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the AL@@ T mirror increases to 3 times the upper limit of the norm , liver enzy@@ ms are as soon as possible to control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a patient symptoms develops to point to a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , torso problems , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or darker hard@@ n , are the liver enzy@@ matic values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision on whether the treatment of patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is continued , should be led to the pre@@ ferences of the laboratory parameters of clinical assessment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical studies using Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a dos@@ is@@ tive weight gain has been proven that may differ from grease deposits and in some cases connected with liquid re@@ tention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result of hem@@ og@@ al@@ ign@@ es under the therapy with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in compar@@ ative controlled trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in to 1 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity to patients who obtain Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on as oral twin or triple combination therapy with a sul@@ phi@@ l resin or as a twin combination therapy with insulin @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the introduction of the introduction of thi@@ ac@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , one occurrence or deteri@@ oration of a di@@ abe@@ tic mac@@ ular hole was reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but uns@@ ord@@ ing doctors should be aware of the possibility of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a summar@@ izing analysis of noti@@ fying adverse events in random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,9 Fra@@ c@@ tures , with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated women and 1.1 Fra@@ con@@ tours of women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study conducted over 3.5 years for exam@@ ining kar@@ di@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ine events , frac@@ tures were treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0,5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients with a compar@@ ative medication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnant women , and if a patient wish a pregnancy or this entry is necessary ( see Section 4.6 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; studies on the study of interactions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
interactions with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contra@@ cep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium metabolism and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ as@@ sel@@ mer are not expected .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of AU@@ C from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on to match 3 times .
simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ Indu@@ ctor ) resulted in a reduction in AU@@ C from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is attri@@ but@@ able to mal@@ oc@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance in the pregnancy , reducing the availability of metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for red@@ dish growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very frequently &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 ; &lt; 1 / 1000 ; &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 1000 ; single cases : unknown ( not in@@ valuable from this data ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these lead to a temporary change of the lens and the refra@@ ctive index of the lens , as it can also be seen in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on stepped up to three times the upper limit of the standard range often occurs as under plac@@ ebo , but less commonly known as in comparison sections under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fo@@ lic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing macro@@ rov@@ ascular illness , the frequency of severe heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was 1.6 % higher than in plac@@ ebo when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on bz@@ w . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the market introduction , when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has been reported in combination with insulin or in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a summar@@ izing analysis of data adverse events in random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients were treated in patients with compar@@ ative medication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in over a period of 3.5 years of ongoing Pro@@ Active study , Fra@@ con@@ tours were treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients with a compar@@ ative medication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , after 180 mg / day over seven days there were no symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on seems to work on a activation of specific kernel recept@@ ors ( per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ation and Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ g ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) which leads to an increased insulin sensi@@ tivity of liver , fat and skel@@ eton cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces the glucose production in the liver and the periph@@ eral Glu@@ cos@@ ever@@ ings increases in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ icide as mon@@ otherapy was continued in two years to examine the time until leaving the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the time after two years after the therapy , blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) was maintained by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in 69 % of patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ ci@@ dal ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar have been insufficient despite thirty @-@ month optimum phase with insulin , to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared with the patients who continued to get insulin ; a reduction of insulin @-@ treated patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on had been observed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials over one year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the album / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine qu@@ oti@@ ate showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease compared to the initial values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small area laid out examination of type 2 di@@ abe@@ tik@@ ern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in most clinical trials a reduction of the overall plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and free fatty acids and a rise of HD@@ L@@ - Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel as well as minor , but clin@@ ically significant increased L@@ DL cholesterol was observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced the total plas@@ mat@@ ri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared to Pla@@ z@@ ebo , a statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol was observed , while under met@@ form@@ in and g@@ lic@@ la@@ ci@@ dal values were observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on did not only produce the so@@ ber tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels as well as to the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as to the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular risk study , 52@@ 38 patients were random@@ ized with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced and cardiovascular therapy , either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after an oral application Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is quickly res@@ or@@ bit@@ ed , whereby the peak concentrations in the plasma is usually accomplished 2 hours after application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on this basis , the M @-@ IV contribution corresponds to efficacy in about the thre@@ e@@ fold efficacy of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in interactions studies , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant impact on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) or with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ In@@ ctor ) or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after an oral application of radioactive pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in humans , the mar@@ ker was found mainly in the rot@@ ting ( 55 % ) and at a lower extent in Har@@ n ( 45 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the medi@@ al plasma elim@@ ination period of un@@ changing pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours , and the total active metabolism is 16 @-@ 23 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Plas@@ ma@@ concentrations of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and its metabolism are lower than in patients with reduced kidney function , but the rates of oral Clear@@ ance of mother@@ hood are similar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in tox@@ ic@@ ological studies in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys have agreed upon repe@@ ating plasma volume magni@@ fication with hem@@ ost@@ al c@@ cent@@ ric cardi@@ ac hyper@@ trop@@ h@@ ie . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ph@@ ane was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as is not able to use insulin to use insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 12 weeks , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ co@@ axial hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which shows how good blood sugar is adjusted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror that hin@@ ted on it that blood sugar levels were cut similar to a other human@@ insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be sensitive to human@@ kind ( allergic ) to human@@ insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane must be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the full list is the package ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane , in the treatment of diabetes , reached the risks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission approved the European Commission of Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for approval of the transport of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pre@@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice a day , if a fast initi@@ ating effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the injection needle must be used under the skin for at least 6 seconds , to ensure that the entire dose inj@@ ected inj@@ ected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients whose blood sugar levels have improved significantly , for example through an intense insulin therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms can be perceived and should be advised accordingly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
any changes regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ ph@@ as@@ ic , long @-@ effective insulin for insulin ) and / or production method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA compared to insulin of animal origin ) can cause a change of dosage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if switching to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane is required when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane , it can be necessary in the first dose or months after the change@@ over . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some patients , with hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions after a change from animal to human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia reported less pronounced than in their previous insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prior to travelling that go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to catch the Council of his doctor , as such trips can lead to other times and have to be taken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions in the therapy , and his patients always ask for other medicines used by them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who have already used signs of cryst@@ alli@@ zation deposits including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or plaster notes ( &quot; stones &quot; ) or higher pri@@ mor@@ ate deposits ; which can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the ur@@ inary acid is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ ency , the dose may be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first treatment months , pois@@ ons may still occur ; therefore , patients at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic will still take more medicines for prevention of pois@@ oning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the medicine is not recommended for children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ tation , as it was not investigated for those groups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first study enrolled at 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) were compared with the plac@@ ebo ( head@@ light drug ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( other medicines for hyper@@ ur@@ ik@@ a@@ emia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the second study two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of 300 mg per day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary acid was in the blood for the last three measurements under 6 mg / dl . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients , Aden@@ ur@@ ic had a daily dose of 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who once daily intake a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of under 6 mg / dl . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in comparison to this , it was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diarr@@ hoea , nausea ( nautical sea ) , rash and normal liver values .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially in patients with cardi@@ ac pain in history , perhaps an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that aden@@ ur@@ ic acid was effective in the blood , but also a higher risk of side effects in connection with heart and blood vessels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with severe kidney illness , efficacy and safety have not been completely investigated ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children and adolescents When there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the application of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with other har@@ p@@ aci@@ dic medicines , it can occur during the treatment to a acute tox@@ icity because due to the lowering of the ser@@ um acid level , urea can first be mobili@@ zed in the tissues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B. with mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han syndrome ) , the absolute concentration of x@@ an@@ thin in the urine is so far reaching that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during clinical trials of Phase 3 , liver clinical trials were observed with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at patients ( 3,5 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it is recommended to implement the F@@ eb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ ment and in further course depending on clinical report and a liver function ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

pregnancy data on a very limited number of exp@@ on@@ ated pregn@@ ancies may not close side effects from F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at to the pregnancy or health of the fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experimental studies do not apply to direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be careful when taxation of a vehicle , serving machines or exercising dangerous actions , until they can be reasonably affected by the AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a numer@@ ical incidence of higher incidence was observed in the overall stat@@ ec@@ al study in phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term efficacy studies ( 1,4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patients years ) and no caus@@ al correlation was found and no caus@@ al correlation could be found .

F@@ eb@@ ux@@ e@@ at is a powerful , non @-@ sel@@ ective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i @-@ value for the in vitro in@@ hibition that is below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range .
clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ v@@ ot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) which were performed with hyper@@ hi@@ ik@@ a@@ emia and g@@ out using 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in every study , the primary efficacy end@@ point was the patients &apos; proportion ( 3@@ 57 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ n@@ l / l ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) and AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) and AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) for patients with a ser@@ um incre@@ ment at the beginning of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX @-@ study showed the statisti@@ cally significant su@@ peri@@ ority of 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ n@@ l / l ) ( see table 2 and Figure 1 ) as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statisti@@ cally significant su@@ peri@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the usual dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with ser@@ um micro@@ organisms &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were summar@@ ised for the analysis . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus 80 mg .
the lowering of the ser@@ um acid level at &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the medical visit in week 2 and maintain permanently over the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um incre@@ ments &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the primary end@@ point in the sub @-@ group of patients with ren@@ al function limit@@ ing The AP@@ EX study evaluated the effectiveness of 40 patients with kidney re@@ tention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC the primary efficacy end@@ point was reached 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) and 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage of the percentage of ser@@ um diseases ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with heavy kidney function ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub @-@ group of patients with ser@@ um har@@ n@@ acid concentrations observed 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) at the beginning of the study ( Bas@@ eline ) had a ser@@ um concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data collected in two years showed the data collected by the open extension study of phase 3 that resulted in a decrease in the incidence of cases required at &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ n@@ l / l ) in the months of 16 @-@ 24 months ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a feed ) .
this was associated with a reduction of g@@ ad@@ h size which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the no@@ des no@@ des up to month 24 .
increased t@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.8 % ) in the open long @-@ term renewal studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) increased by F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at to be ordered and multi @-@ cou@@ pler doses ranging from 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for cans between 120 mg and 300 mg , a rise in AU@@ C is observed , which is greater than the dos@@ is@@ proportional increase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after taking easier or multi @-@ stroke doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.@@ 0 @-@ 5.@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage of ser@@ um molecules , if this has been tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady state power distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at lies in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking part of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plasma @-@ binding of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ e@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary relationship to Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is about the concentration range , which is achieved with doses ranging from 80 to 120 mg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine we found approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair as un@@ altered F@@ eb@@ ux@@ e@@ at ( 12 % ) which is known as a non @-@ known oxida@@ tive metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown Met@@ abol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special patients group ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multi@@ focal doses of 80 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney disease , the C@@ max of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ e@@ at did not change in relation to subjects with normal kidney function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mean total AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at increased about the 1.8 @-@ times of 7,5 μ , in the group with normal kidney function on 13.@@ 2 μ g / ml in the group with severe kidney function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these findings are seen as a result of a specialist Pur@@ in@@ met@@ alli@@ zation and urine , and is not considered to be relevant for clinical application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was noted that F@@ eb@@ ux@@ e@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fertility and reproduction performance of male and female rats .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with high doses , the under@@ taking about 4,@@ 3 fold of the human tox@@ icity , the maternal tox@@ icity stepped up with a reduction in raising performance and a development delay in the offspring of rats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

diarr@@ hoea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who at the same time are treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical trials no severe skin erup@@ tions or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the open long @-@ term renewal studies , 9@@ 06 patients were treated with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ e@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg for up to 3 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the approval of the approval of the approval process is to ensure that a pharmaceutical co@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system is described as described in version 2.0 module 1.@@ 8.1 for the approval of the application , and so long is available as the medicine is placed in the traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a updated R@@ MP is provided with the CH@@ MP Gui@@ del@@ ine to risk management systems for human medicines with the next peri@@ odic safety update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; additionally , an update of the R@@ MP is required • If new information is available , which have an impact on the security data , the pharmaceutical co@@ il@@ ance plan or activities in 60 days after reaching an important mil@@ estones ( pharmaceutical co@@ vig@@ il@@ ance or risk management ) • on request of the EMEA ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some people , ur@@ ic acid occurs in the blood and can achieve levels that are so high that ur@@ ic acid is in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you keep the urine of urine by the 1 x daily intake of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the cryst@@ alline formation is prevented and in this way reducing the dis@@ comfort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC may not be taken if you are sensitive to the active substance F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or any of the other components of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC .
inform your doctor before taking this medicine by taking care of this medication or if you suffer a cardi@@ ac disease or in a other heart problem . • When you suffer from a high blood pressure cancer or the Les@@ ch @-@ Ny@@ han @-@ Syn@@ dro@@ ms ( a rare inn@@ ate condition ) treated with too much ur@@ ic acid in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have a tox@@ in at the moment ( sudden appearance of severe pain , pressure sensitivity , redness , heat @-@ feeling and joint vibration ) , before you begin with the treatment of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this does not have to be with everyone , but may also occur with you , especially during the first treatment weeks or mon@@ ate , occur if you are using AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your doctor will treat you other medicines , in order to prevent pois@@ oning , or to treat the associated symptoms ( such as pain and joint vibration ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines / apply or used recently , even if it is not prescri@@ ption drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is particularly important that you may use your doctor or pharmac@@ ist when using AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC ( for the treatment of cancer ) • Az@@ ath@@ i@@ op@@ rine ( for the treatment of cancer ) • pi@@ ge@@ ophy@@ l@@ in ( for the treatment of as@@ thma ) • War@@ far@@ in ( for the treatment of diseases ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no studies on the effects of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC on the traffic and the ability to serve machines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , please take AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC after consultation with your doctor if you know that you suffer from a toler@@ ability towards certain sugar@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the back of the bli@@ ster , the individual week@@ days are printed if you have taken a tablet every day . • The tablets need to be swal@@ lowed and can be taken with or without food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis ( one disease , in which the bones are frag@@ ile ) in women after men@@ opause , with which there is a risk for a low vitamin D mirror . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplement ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to avoid irritation of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient may take place after the first food intake of the day , which should take place 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate and vitamin D3 are already separately approved in medicines that are approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with o@@ steopor@@ osis , in order to prove the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing vitamin D levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , patients with a low vitamin D mirror was treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than those with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 32 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company also provided data that the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose , which is needed for preventing a bone loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain , bones , or joints ) and symptoms of digestive problems , dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , ul@@ cers ( ul@@ cers ) , ul@@ cers ( blo@@ gging ) and hem@@ orr@@ ha@@ gia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , vitamin D3 and one of the other components AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE cannot be applied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must not be used in diseases of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium level ) or in patients who can &apos;t stand or sit for at least 30 minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission granted approval by the company Mer@@ ck Sharp and Doh@@ me Ltd . , a approval of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cap@@ su@@ lations , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first eat or drink of medicines ( including an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supple@@ mentary products ) for the day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following indicators are to follow exactly , in order to reduce the risk of mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ations and related side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be thrown after the emergence of the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) and the tablet is not supposed to take place before the first food intake of the day that should take place 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B. pep@@ tic ul@@ cus , active gast@@ ro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical interventions in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ oplas@@ tic , are only be given under special caution ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ es@@ op@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as est@@ es@@ ha@@ gia , mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a and mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al sei@@ z@@ ations , were seldom followed by mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ tic stro@@ kes , some were severe and required a hospital order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the doctor should therefore refer to all signs and symptoms that refer to potential mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions like dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain during swal@@ lowing or retro@@ active heart@@ burn to obtain medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 The risk of severe cancer effects appear to be increased in patients , which does not take the medicine correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that are on a mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is very important that all dos@@ ing instructions can be passed on to patients and be understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while in large @-@ wide clinical trials with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no higher risk was found , including some grave and complications , reported ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ ros@@ is of the Pine , usually reported in connection with a dental reduction and / or local infection ( including O@@ ste@@ omyel@@ itis ) , whose treatment courses predominantly administered intraven@@ ously and called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no data available to provide evidence whether the absorption of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ therapy in patients , which reduces the risk of o@@ ste@@ on@@ at@@ ros@@ is of the jaw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clinical assessment by the treated doctor is author@@ itative for treatment planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients must be dependent on the intake of a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the tablet in the next morning , after having noticed their legacy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you should not take two tablets on the same day , but taking the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on the day of the week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other diseases affecting the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE therapy .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in o@@ steopor@@ osis , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was effective when it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in healthy volunteers , the gift of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily ) resulted in no clin@@ ically significant alter@@ ation of oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 9 distribution studies on rats have yiel@@ ded that Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is distributed after intraven@@ ous injection of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly spread in the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

after intraven@@ ous gift of a single dose of 10 mg the ren@@ al clearing of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 71 ml / min and System@@ ic Clear@@ ance exceeded 200 ml / min .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is not ex@@ cre@@ ted over the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys , and therefore it is not accepted that by humans the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines by these transport systems is affected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; characteristics of clinical trials showed that the share of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , which is not stored in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted over the urine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there is no clinical data available , it is still that the ren@@ al elim@@ ination of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate as in the animal try to be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , in patients with reduced kidney function , a slightly increased cum@@ ulation of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate in bone can be expected ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tablets are available as ri@@ ght@@ ful , white to broken white tablets , lab@@ elled with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 270 &quot; on the other side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ad@@ vag@@ raf is administered to adult patients who transplan@@ ted a kidney or liver , to prevent transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Progra@@ f / Progra@@ f has already been deployed in the EU , the company has presented the results of previously conducted studies with Progra@@ f / Programming as well as data from published literature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the results of a clinical study submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , whereby the application of Ad@@ vag@@ raf has been compared with Progra@@ f / Progra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients due to which the transplan@@ t was dead after a treatment duration of one year , as often an improved organ transplan@@ tation or a res@@ um@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , recent studies were conducted in 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and exam@@ ines how Ad@@ vag@@ ue is absorbed by the body as compared to Progra@@ f / Progra@@ mmer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tre@@ ber ( trem@@ ors ) , head@@ aches , nausea , vom@@ iting , diarr@@ he@@ a ( hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia ) , hypertension , increased blood sugar levels ( hypertension ) , hypertension , and in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro lens antibiotics ( such as er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or other ingredients may not be applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients and doctors must be cau@@ tious if others ( especially several herbal ) drugs should be taken simultaneously with Ad@@ vag@@ ue as the prescribed medication should be adjusted accordingly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in red ink , hard capsules , re@@ tar@@ ded yellow @-@ orange , printed in red ink on the light yellow capsule part with &quot; 6@@ 47 &quot; ; they contain white powder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only physi@@ cians who are familiar with the immune supp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ tation patients should be used to classi@@ fy this drug or alter changes in immun@@ os@@ supp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of system@@ ic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to transplan@@ t attacks or an increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; modifications of the formulation or regime should only be made under the close control of an experienced medical device ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a consequence of a transition to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and corresponding dose can be carried out to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dosage of Ad@@ vag@@ raf should be primarily based on clinical assessment of shar@@ pen@@ ing and toler@@ ability in individual cases , and to blood pressure regulations ( see below &quot; recommendations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the conversion from programming to Ad@@ vag@@ raf , the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ ers should be controlled before switching and over two weeks after switching . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on day 4 , the system@@ ic exposure , measured as a drop mirror , was comparable with both formu@@ lations both in case of liver transplan@@ ted patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
careful and repeated insp@@ ections of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ ers are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Ad@@ vag@@ raf ; to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate after@@ transplan@@ tation phase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low clearing , an adjustment of the vag@@ ue can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the patient &apos;s condition is not permitted in the first post @-@ surgical phase , the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment intraven@@ ously ( progra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate on the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) can be initiated with a dose of ca . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; duration of the application for op@@ pression of transplan@@ tation must be maintained ; therefore , therefore , the maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dos@@ ages - kidney transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis and transplan@@ tation The oral Ad@@ vag@@ ue therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
further dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tations may be required later as the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of stabili@@ zation of the patient after transplan@@ tation .
dose recommendation - liver transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis and transplan@@ tation The oral Ad@@ vag@@ ue therapy should begin with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dos@@ is@@ recommended - conversion from Progra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ ue must be taken into a transplan@@ t of twice daily dosage of Progra@@ f capsules at once daily intake of Ad@@ vag@@ raf , so this change in relation to the whole daily dose may be made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a transition from other immun@@ og@@ res@@ si@@ va to ad@@ vag@@ ue , after a transition from other immun@@ og@@ res@@ si@@ va to ad@@ vag@@ ue , treatment with liver transplan@@ tation will be recommended daily for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ tation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heart transplan@@ tation In adult patients who are ques@@ tioned on Ad@@ vag@@ ue , is an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day daily at once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other transplan@@ t recept@@ ors Ob@@ well there are no clinical experience with Ad@@ vag@@ raf in lung cancer and dar@@ m@@ transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tations in special patient groups with reduced liver function for maintaining blood refle@@ ctions in the target range can be charged in patients with heavy liver function .
patients with reduced kidney function Since the kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be assumed that a dose can not be required .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ li@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , a careful monitoring of the kidney function ( including a regular determination of the ser@@ um in@@ filtration and monitoring of urine volume ) is recommended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conversion of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Ad@@ vag@@ ue When switching from a Cic@@ los@@ por@@ ine to a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations of the drop @-@ level in full blood The dose should be primarily based on clinical assessment of cav@@ ity and toler@@ ability in individual cases of full blood @-@ radi@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ levels insp@@ ections .
it is recommended to perform frequent insp@@ ections of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ ers during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ Tal@@ ers of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also change after changing Progra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ raf , Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tion , changes of immun@@ o@@ supp@@ res@@ sive therapy or for simultaneous use of substances which may change the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood @-@ blood concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Ad@@ vag@@ ue is a drug with a low clearing , adap@@ tations of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the data in clinical studies indicate that a successful treatment in most cases is possible , if the tal@@ low level does not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in clinical practice the Tal@@ ers of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are usually lying in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and in case of liver transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the following maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ tation , blood concentrations tend to be used in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has led to serious adverse events , including transplan@@ t attacks or other side effects that occur in sequence of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or over@@ exposure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; modifications of the formulation or regime should only be made under the close control of an experienced medical device ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ ting po@@ inter , which proved to be treated against other immun@@ og@@ res@@ si@@ va , no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation of Ad@@ vag@@ raf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to prevent proph@@ yla@@ xis , transplan@@ ting and gra@@ fts in adult heart transplan@@ ts are not yet submitted to clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation of Ad@@ vag@@ raf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of possible interactions which can lead to a reduction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ muscle levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or other plant remedi@@ es during treatment with Ad@@ vag@@ ue ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with diarr@@ hoea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ h concentrations in the blood is advisable because the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to considerable variations in these circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in rare cases a cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was referred to as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy which can therefore be found under Ad@@ vag@@ raf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders , are an already existing heart disease , high blood pressure , kidney or liver disorders , infections , fluid circul@@ ating and oils . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with other immun@@ og@@ res@@ si@@ va , the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted because of the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes with a high protection factor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when patients take the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for Pre@@ s such as head@@ aches , changes of consciousness , cra@@ mps and vision problems , should be a radi@@ ological examination ( eg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Ad@@ vag@@ ue Hart@@ kap@@ ass , re@@ tar@@ ded , lac@@ tose , is recommended in patients with the rare her@@ edi@@ tary Gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ int@@ oler@@ ance , lac@@ tose deficiency or glucose v@@ lac@@ tose special absorption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the simultaneous application of medicines or herbal remedi@@ es , which are known as inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , can increase the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is therefore advisable to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - blood level , while able to monitor the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose for maintaining uniform concentrations accordingly ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a strong interaction between k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , and vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole , as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiot@@ ic Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ tia ( z ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies resulted in the rise of blood levels mainly from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus caused by in@@ hibition of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal gases .
high @-@ dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one as it is used for acute absorption reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be known as CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors ; therefore , the simultaneous application of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by CY@@ P3@@ A4 , whose metabolism can affect the metabolism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contra@@ cep@@ tives , and thereby increase hormon@@ al exposure , is particularly cau@@ tious regarding per@@ cep@@ tive measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and extend their half @-@ time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients provide no indication that under Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can provide an increased risk of unwanted events regarding the course and result of pregnancy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are recommended ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is the risk of an early birth ( &lt; Week 37 ) and hyper@@ cali@@ br@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns ) :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the side @-@ acting profile of immun@@ os@@ res@@ si@@ va is often not closely associated with a variety of other medicines , with a variety of other medicines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases As well known in other highly effective immun@@ os@@ u@@ ress@@ ants , patients who are treated with tactics ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , prot@@ o@@ zo@@ ic ) frequently increases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cases of BK @-@ Virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ Virus associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ k@@ en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ o@@ deficiency therapy .
it has been reported about ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant Ne@@ oplas@@ mic diseases and skin tum@@ ors associated with the treatment of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and plasma rotation can be accepted that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can not di@@ aly@@ zed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be conve@@ yed by its li@@ aison to a cy@@ tos@@ tic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for the en@@ rich@@ ment of the connection in the cellular memory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent inhibit@@ ing of signal transmission due to the T @-@ cell and prevents tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ha@@ kin genes .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; overall , the safety profile of oral programme in these published studies contained the observ@@ ations in the large studies in which programme was used in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ tation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an interim analysis , L@@ ung@@ ra@@ fting Study has reported a multi @-@ cent@@ ric study conducted over 110 patients who received either Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis bar@@ gain , bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis , was also observed in the first year after transplan@@ tation was often observed ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the number of cases where Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 0.@@ 02 ) as the number of patients suffering from Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) .

in a study the frequency of the birth of a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis was significantly lower in patients with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus patients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a multi @-@ cent@@ ric study conducted with oral programming was subjected to 205 patients who have been subjected to a pancre@@ as and kidney transplan@@ tation , which were random@@ ised to random@@ ised procedures Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the initial initial dose ( by protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and after reaching the targeted field level from 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml was 5 .

Adv@@ ate is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII related to con@@ genital distur@@ bing ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dosage and frequency of the application are then directed , whether Adv@@ ate is applied to the treatment of hem@@ orr@@ ha@@ ge or to the prevention of hem@@ orr@@ ha@@ ges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency , which causes blood problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles , or inner organs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but according to a method that is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is produced by a cell where a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced to educ@@ ate it for the formation of the human cl@@ an factor VIII .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adv@@ ate is the drug approved in the European Union ( Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , similar ) , but does not contain proteins of human or animal origin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A , among them a study of 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the main study , Adv@@ ate was the efficacy of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood c@@ eri@@ des with &quot; excellent &quot; resp@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common side effects from Adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ie ( fever ) and the formation of anti@@ bodies against factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate is not allowed to be used in patients who may be sensitive ( allergic ) against the human ger@@ inn@@ ess factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted authori@@ zation to Ba@@ x@@ ter AG an approval of the establishment of Adv@@ ates throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dos@@ ing and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy is based on the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII @-@ Man@@ gels , following the place and the extent of blood and the clinical condition of patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following hem@@ orr@@ ha@@ gic events , the factor VIII in the corresponding period shall not fall into the specified plasma level ( in % of the norm or in i.e. / dl ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
injection : every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients below 6 years ) can be repeated for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute impair@@ ment removed .
injection : repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the danger is over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during treatment , to control the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections a reasonable determination of the factor VIII plasma level is stimulated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
individual patients can differ in their reaction to factor VIII different in vi@@ vo Recovery and have different half @-@ ups .
3 Pre@@ vention for long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e. by factor VIII per kg of body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the expected factor VIII plasma @-@ activities cannot be reached or if the bleeding is not governed by an appropriate dose , a test must be performed to prove a inhibit@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic interventions must be considered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should the adoption of the patient should be addressed , the maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alising anti@@ bodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known comp@@ lication in treating patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always directed against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the risk , inhibit@@ ors to develop , cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 ex@@ positions of the greatest is and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ positions and an@@ am@@ nes@@ er inhibit@@ ors , the re@@ re@@ combin@@ ant of the inhibit@@ ors was observed from another re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the rare setting of hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A in women , there are no experiences about the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast@@ feeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inhibit@@ ors of patients who have occurred in the largest number of patients ( 5 patients ) showed a higher risk for the formation of inhibit@@ ors , involving head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( frequencies on the basis of available data not in@@ valuable ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of individual patients ( 234 ) ( b ) . the unexpected drop of the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII ( 10 - 14 post@@ oper@@ atively ) was post@@ oper@@ atively in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the time , and both the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirror in the plasma and the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient values on the 15th post @-@ operational day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE to 145 children and adults 2 with mild to moderate hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII &lt; 2 % ) and prior exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concent@@ rates ( ≥ 150 days ) showed a low inhibit@@ ors with A@@ DV@@ ATE ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , not a 53 pedi@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed with severe hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concent@@ rates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII In@@ hibit@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients inhibit@@ ors were treated against factor VIII in previously un@@ treated patients with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immune response of patients on traces of contamination of proteins was analyzed by the investigation of anti@@ bodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a patient showed a statisti@@ cally significant impact resistance as well as an ongoing peak of anti @-@ Ch@@ o cell remedi@@ es , but otherwise there were no symptoms or symptoms that showed an allergic reaction , or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in four patients , the occurrence of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ es Gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes reported on several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the activated factor VIII works as a factor for activ@@ ating factor IX , and accelerates the formation of activated factor X from factor X . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 156 In the case of blood cells , the factor VIII in the corresponding period should not fall under the specified plasma activity ( in % or i.e. , i.e. / ml ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the data available since the first approval of the CH@@ MP , CH@@ MP has further evaluated the benefit @-@ risk assessment as positive but in consideration that the safety profile must be closely monitored by the following reasons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP needs on the basis of the security profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a filing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another renewal procedure in 5 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited adopted the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) , that the company accepts his application for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , normally the breast , the brain , bone or body parts ( tissue , which combines other structures in the body , surrounds and supports ) of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a kind of virus , the genetically modified that it can wear a gene into the cells of the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Adv@@ oc@@ in , the virus is a &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus &quot; which was so modified that there are no copies of itself and therefore no infections can trigger the human . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adv@@ oc@@ in could have inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is made from the defect in the human body existing p@@ 53 gene , is usually used to restore corrupt DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , the p@@ 53 protein doesn &apos;t work properly , and the cancer cells continue to grow and share . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company presented data from a study involving a patient prior to the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , in the bone and in the brain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the CH@@ MP has examined the answers by the company , questions were still un@@ solved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the examination of the initial documents , the CH@@ MP grants a list of questions that will be sent to the company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to CH@@ MP , the injection of Adv@@ ant@@ in has been documented in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ors benefits for the patient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the committee had concerns regarding the processing of medication in the body , the type of appoint@@ ments as well as the safety of medication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the company was not sufficiently proven that Adv@@ oc@@ in can be produced in a reliable manner and that there is neither for the environment nor for people who come in touch with the patient which is harmful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company was not aware of the CH@@ MP , whether the withdrawal of the patient has been involved in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; changed mode of action &quot; means that the tablets are so composed of that the effective components are immediately released and the other slowly released over a few hours .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seas@@ on@@ ally allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( ha@@ y fever ) caused by an allergy against pol@@ len ( nas@@ al membran@@ es ) in patients with r@@ hin@@ c@@ anti@@ le vibration ( c@@ logged nose ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in adults and you@@ ths over 12 years , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily with a glass of water with or without food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the duration of treatment should be as short as possible and end as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nose s@@ mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ oned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended , because the effects of the medication can be im@@ paired with the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main dimensions were the changes of gravity of the fever bli@@ ster symptoms , which were reported from the patients prior to treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours a journal and rated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upon consideration of all hypo@@ cris@@ y symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported the patients , the aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze reported , on a decrease in the symptoms of 4@@ 6.0 % compared with 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % compared to patients receiving p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only the swelling of the r@@ s@@ mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , patients suffering from aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze showed a reli@@ eving of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients suffering from the disin@@ teg@@ rate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common side effects of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze ( observe at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are speed@@ iness ( heart ch@@ ase ) , sti@@ p@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or , psych@@ omot@@ or ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence and nerv@@ ousness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is allowed to be sensitive to patients who possibly are over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other components , against ad@@ ren@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any other medicines for allergi@@ es ) are not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may also not suffer from patients who suffer from a stroke of pressure ( hypertension ) , cardi@@ ac or v@@ ascular diseases ( hypertension ) or hyper@@ thy@@ roid ( hypertension ) or a hem@@ orr@@ ha@@ ge stroke ( hypertension ) or a risk of hem@@ orr@@ ha@@ ge stroke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission approved the SP Europe Commission for approval for the transport of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tablet may be taken with a glass of water , but should swallow in the whole ( i.e. without bit@@ ing , break or chew@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied to children under 12 years due to the lack of data for imp@@ em@@ ability and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the duration of the application is as short as possible , and should not be continued after closing of the symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , since long @-@ term application can take the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a decrease in the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory system , the treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in as mon@@ otherapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze contains p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients who are treated with a mon@@ o@@ am@@ oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors or within 2 weeks following completion of such therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combin@@ ated application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , per@@ go@@ l , l@@ ull or nas@@ al as ab@@ yss of Rhin@@ oc@@ ets ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amin , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxi@@ dation , etc . ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety and efficacy of these combination therapy were not checked for this patient group , and the data are not sufficient to address appropriate recommendations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety and efficacy of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver interference , and the data are not sufficient to address appropriate recommendations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients need to be informed about the treatment of the treatment of hyper@@ ton@@ ia or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ cartridge , cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea , or any other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a gain of head@@ ache ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients suffering from the following patient groups are advised to be@@ ware : • Pati@@ ents with cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mic problems • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese ( diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ) or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ mus in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ologic tests , as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise can prevent positive reactions on indicators for skin reactions or reduce their extent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , in which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given , however , no clin@@ ically relevant alter@@ nating or alter@@ ations of the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the results of psych@@ omot@@ or testing were detected no significant differences between the patients &apos; dis@@ cer@@ eal patients and the plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients , regardless of whether the pro@@ ces@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone or with alcohol was taken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism has not been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be excluded entirely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in vi@@ vo CY@@ P3@@ A4 does not inhi@@ bit , and in @-@ vitro studies that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bits and neither a sub@@ strate nor a inhibit@@ or of the P gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ consistency of the application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured , but gained from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies however no increase in frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared with the normal population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since recur@@ ring studies on animals are not always transferred to humans , due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ctor characteristics of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze should not be used in pregnancy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , patients should be clari@@ fied that in very rare cases it may come to a benefit of the transport capability or the ability to serve machinery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ ne@@ e , reduced mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular disease , tre@@ ach , conc@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible le@@ aps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; head@@ aches , anxiety , kill mic@@ tion , muscle weakness , nausea , vom@@ iting , breathing , nausea , vom@@ iting , pre@@ cor@@ di@@ ous pain , verti@@ go , t@@ att@@ aches , dys@@ functions , hyper@@ ton@@ ia or hyp@@ ot@@ onia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely with children , as well as At@@ rop@@ in typical symptoms ( mouth dr@@ yers , pup@@ il rigid and di@@ le@@ at@@ ation , skin con@@ sol@@ ation , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they include both the in@@ hibition of inflam@@ matory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ ine cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the inhibit@@ ing of the expression of the blood cells P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin in end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no effect on standard measurement values of the fluctu@@ ation including the rein@@ forcement of subjective injuries and tasks that are connected with the flies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dose of 5 mg a day no increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess was found compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the oral application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause additional lik@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects such as an increase in blood pressure or t@@ ach@@ y@@ cartridge or manifest@@ ations of a Z@@ NS arous@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients participated in the age between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , with 4@@ 14 patients with Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both studies the hist@@ amine efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined based on the overall score for the symptom ( except nose s@@ mu@@ cos@@ al swelling ) , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine above the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets in terms of the det@@ ecting effect , determined based on the nose @-@ mu@@ cos@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherap@@ y@@ ad@@ in over the 2 @-@ week treatment time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of sex , age or ethnic origin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within a single dose study for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in is veri@@ fiable within 30 minutes after administration in the plasma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze at healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow weight of the lor@@ ries was reached in 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in day 10 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dos@@ is@@ cence study conducted with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult subjects , four subjects of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was found badly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) by p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine is as the sole gift of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio@@ equivalent to the gift of an Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on conventional studies on security mac@@ ology , for tox@@ icity in repeated administration , to gene ot@@ ox@@ icity and reproduction of reproduction , genetic data may be recognized with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the combination had no greater tox@@ icity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the compound of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in / p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was the combination of r@@ ins@@ ul@@ in / p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and is not ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the relief of allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a substance that can un@@ fold its effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets left symptoms that occur in connection with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( ha@@ y fever ) , like ni@@ gh@@ es , stri@@ ving or ju@@ ck@@ ling eyes , while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

it is available as 5 mg tablets or 5 m@@ g@@ - ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0,5 mg / ml solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , which in the form of 2.5 ml syrup or bz@@ w . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml syrup or bz@@ w . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ eri@@ us was examined in eight studies involving roughly 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( among them four studies of seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , and two trials of patients who also had as@@ thma ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the efficacy was measured by the change of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of tor@@ ches , impair@@ ment of sleep and efficiency in days ) before and after six weeks treatment was determined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further studies were presented to prove that the body evalu@@ ates the syrup , the solution to remove and the melting tablets in the same manner as the tablets and the application of children is harmless . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , when the results of all trials were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us were obtained by 25 to 32 % , compared with the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving a plac@@ ebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the two trials in Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the decline of symptoms after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared with 40 and 33 % compared with plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be applied to patients who possibly have excessive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , lau@@ at@@ ad@@ in or any of the other ingredients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the SP Europe corporation to appro@@ ve an approval of the establishment of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are limited experiences from clinical trials for efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine for young people from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be performed according to the previous disease , and can be res@@ umed in subsequent correc@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) , patients may be recommended during the allergy time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not detected in the context of clinical trials involving Des@@ cl@@ at@@ ad@@ in tablets in which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation of A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol was not increasingly reinforced by alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , patients should be clari@@ fied that in very rare cases it may come to benefit the transport capability or the ability to serve machinery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clinical trials in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ma@@ tik@@ aria , were reported daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us when patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most commonly used side effects , more than common in plac@@ ebo , were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , mouth @-@ dryer ( 0.6 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.6 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 you@@ th@@ ful patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common adverse effect of patients having been treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and 6.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , administered up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes both the inhibit@@ ing of pro@@ inflam@@ matory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ ine cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the inhibit@@ ing of the expression of the blood cells P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin in end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of a clinical study involving multiple agents , administered in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) has been administered for ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a single dos@@ is@@ - study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no effect on standard measurement values of the fluctu@@ ation including the rein@@ forcement of subjective injuries and tasks that are connected with the flies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as ni@@ fying , nose secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear and redness of the eyes and it@@ ching on the palate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis may be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and per@@ enni@@ al allergic to allergic symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Persian allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as the appearance of symptoms of 4 or more days a week , and more than 4 weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with the overall score of quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces those caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ma@@ tik@@ aria was investigated for further forms of primitive ide@@ ology , since the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology of various forms is similar to chronic patients and easier pro@@ spec@@ tively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the hist@@ amine is a caus@@ al factor in all ancest@@ ral diseases , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in is also confirmed in other forms of Ur@@ tik@@ aria to improve the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ma@@ tik@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving the size and number of p@@ add@@ les at the end of the first dose intervals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ma@@ tik@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines from the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an improvement in the vertical resistance of more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of the treated patients , compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wax import@@ antly , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale on evaluation of these variables . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which the patients demo@@ ograph@@ ics were comparable with the general seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis population , in 4 % of patients a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was achieved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are no clu@@ es for a clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after a daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the enzyme responsible for metabol@@ ites was not yet identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be excluded entirely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in inhi@@ bits CY@@ P3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies , that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bits and neither a sub@@ strate nor a inhibit@@ or of the P gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a single dos@@ ing study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in an dosage of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty food and cal@@ orie @-@ rich breakfast ) does not apply to the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clinical studies carried out with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in performed in a comparable degree of exposure of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , no qualitative or quantitative differences in the tox@@ icity of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on conventional studies on Safety Pharmac@@ ology , Tox@@ icity at repe@@ ating gift , Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and Re@@ productive data to detect no particular dangers for human beings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken regardless of meals , to alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prescri@@ ption doctor should be aware that most cases of r@@ hin@@ itis in children under 2 years of age can be caused by an infection ( see under Section 4.4 ) and that no data is received , which support treatment of a inf@@ ective r@@ hin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis of an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical investigations and related laboratory and skin studies should play a role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of metabolic des@@ lor@@ ries are reduced and experienced a higher sub@@ section load ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children between 2 and 11 years , which are limited to metabolic , is identical to children that are normal to metabolic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this medicine contains sac@@ char@@ ose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems should not take care of fru@@ ct@@ ose in@@ toler@@ ation or sac@@ char@@ ase is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not detected in the clinical trials involving A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol did not ampli@@ fy the beneficial effects of alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the total ru@@ th@@ ness of the side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up Group , similar to the plac@@ ebo group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ma@@ tik@@ aria , were reported in the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us when patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and youth , administered up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children aged between 1 and 11 , who came into question for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily disin@@ teg@@ rate dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the course of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opathic ma@@ tik@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults and children can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of a clinical study involving multiple agents of adults and you@@ ths , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of up to 20 mg daily , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study enrolled in adults and adolescents , in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) has been applied for ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in controlled clinical studies the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , no increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with an individual daily dose of 7,5 mg A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and juven@@ iles in clinical trials have no impair@@ ment of psych@@ omot@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies , it was caused by the simultaneous taking of alcohol to an increase of alcohol @-@ induced effectiveness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in adult and adol@@ es@@ cent patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching and redness of the eyes and it@@ ching on the palate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with the overall score of quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively produce those caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ma@@ tik@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving the size and number of p@@ add@@ les at the end of the first dose intervals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the spread of this limited metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults and 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ sia ( 2 % adults and 3 % children ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , which are limited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the load ( AU@@ C ) caused by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in was approximately 6 to 6 hours approximately 6 times higher , and the C@@ max . 3 to 4@@ times higher with a terminal half @-@ time of about 120 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no clu@@ es for a clin@@ ically relevant drug cum@@ ulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and youth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 12 In different individual dose studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max @-@ values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in pedi@@ at@@ ric patients were comparable with those of adults who received the deser@@ ho@@ at@@ ad@@ in syrup in a dose of 5 mg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the enzyme responsible for metabol@@ ites was not yet identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be excluded entirely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up is offered in type III plastic bottles with child @-@ safe Poly@@ propylene cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; equipped with a rigid , transparent polystyrene measuring spoon , cali@@ br@@ ated with 2.5 ml and 5 ml or with a application sp@@ ection for inser@@ tion from 2.5 ml and 5 ml ( only for 150 ml bottle ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a dose of A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at to insert once daily in the mouth to alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately before the application , the bli@@ ster should be carefully opened and the dose of ly@@ op@@ hi@@ kers can be removed without dam@@ aging them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not determined under clinical trials involving A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were also applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clinical trials in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ma@@ tik@@ aria , were reported daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , when patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , which were applied up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at became well toler@@ ated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical surveys and EC@@ G intervals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of a clinical study involving multiple agents , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in has been applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) has been applied for ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dose of 5 mg a day no increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess was found compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no effect on standard measurement parameters including the rein@@ forcement of subjective injuries and tasks that are connected with the flies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching and redness of the eyes and it@@ ching on the palate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with the overall score of quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces those caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 18 In a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which the patient Dem@@ ograph@@ ics were comparable with the general seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis in population , was achieved in 4 % of patients a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are limited experiences from clinical trials for efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine for young people from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately before the application , the bli@@ ster should be carefully open and the dose of melting tray is removed without dam@@ aging them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; efficacy and in@@ consistency of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melting tablets at the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the total ru@@ th@@ ness of the side effects between the distill@@ at@@ ad@@ ine syrup and the plac@@ ebo group was equal , and did not significantly reduce safety profile from the adult patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us melting tray proved to be bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at for the adoption of deser@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of a clinical study involving multiple agents , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in has been applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clinical study was clin@@ ically significant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no effect on standard measurement parameters including the rein@@ forcement of subjective injuries and tasks that are connected with the flies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the spread of this po@@ or@@ ly metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and Pedi@@ at@@ ric patients ( 6 % ) and Pedi@@ at@@ ric patients aged between 2 and 11 ( children 16 % ) and the safety profile of these patients was not devi@@ ated from the general population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in single dose crossover study of A@@ eri@@ us melting tray with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at , the formu@@ lations were bio@@ equivalent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not examined in pedi@@ at@@ ric patients , but in connection with the dose studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets can be used for children from 6 to 11 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

at the recommended dose A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of melting tray as a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate to the wan@@ ing formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of a clinical study involving multiple agents , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in has been applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in among children between 2 and 11 years , which are limited to metabolic , is identical to children that are normal to metabolic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the total ru@@ th@@ ness of the side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the deser@@ ho@@ at@@ ad@@ in group , similar to the plac@@ ebo group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for infants between 6 and 23 months the most common side effects were reported , more than common in plac@@ ebo , diarr@@ hoea ( 3.7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2.3 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an additional study , 2.5 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in solution were observed in a solution of no side effects in patients aged between 6 and 11 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the recommended doses the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( see Section 5.2 ) were comparable in child and adult population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in controlled clinical studies the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , no increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis may vary depending on the duration of symptoms as well as in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with the overall score of quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets could be effectively caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the spread of this limited metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults and 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ sia ( 2 % adults and 3 % children ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since A@@ eri@@ us solution incorpor@@ ates the same concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , no bio@@ equivalent study was necessary and it is expected that it matches the syrup and the tablets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially shared the Committee for Human Use for the Com@@ pi@@ ration of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N1 virus to the prevention of the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N1 virus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people for the protection against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 from the Influ@@ enza @-@ A virus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a special kind of vacc@@ ines that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic , which may cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an influenza pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus appears to spread easily from man , because people still have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the parts of the flu contained in the vaccine as &quot; physical alien &quot; and forming anti@@ bodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thereby , the immune system later is able to form a contact with a gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus of this pedi@@ gree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subsequently , the membrane shell of the virus has been separated from the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface ) separated , cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not performed according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus the scope of the clinical data basis for evalu@@ ating the safety of the vaccine is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the guidelines of the EMEA for pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should you participate in a clinical trial and need further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you wish more information regarding the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years used with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which caused the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for patients who can not swallow the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution to dispos@@ able , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , because the safety of this combination has not been investigated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor has tested , which has taken an anti@@ viral drug in the patient before , and the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood will discuss the virus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice a day , which are taken with twice daily 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ gener@@ ase depends on the body weight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the HIV @-@ quantity in the blood and keeps it at a low level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AIDS is not to heal , but can delay the damage of the immune system and thus delay the development of AIDS associated infections and diseases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ fra@@ ase was examined in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without mal@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ iah . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was compared with low dos@@ ing Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced pharmaceuticals A@@ gener@@ ase was compared with 206 adults who had taken earlier prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ mer , with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ iah . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main indi@@ an indicator for efficacy was the portion of patients with non @-@ demon@@ stra@@ able concentrations of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) , or the change of viral load after treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the studies of patients who had previously not taken Prot@@ e@@ as@@ tia , after 48 weeks under A@@ gener@@ ase more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml under plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ ase had also treated the viral load , but were treated with the children who used to treat the treat earlier with prot@@ e@@ as@@ tia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study with adults who had been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ iah , the viral load increased the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as well as other Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ mer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ e@@ as@@ tia , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger decrease of the viral load after four weeks than in those patients who continued their previous protests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diarr@@ hoea ( diarr@@ he@@ a ) and Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) ; vom@@ iting , rash and Fati@@ gue ( fatigue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients , which may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase may also not be used in patients who are degra@@ ded in patients ( an herbal supplement to treat depression ) or drug , which are harmful as A@@ gener@@ ase and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with other medicines , HIV is treated against HIV , an o@@ ste@@ on@@ dro@@ se ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) or an immun@@ o@@ yst@@ roph@@ one ( symptoms of infection ) or an immun@@ o@@ activation syn@@ dro@@ id symptoms ( symptoms of an infection caused by the rest@@ ful immune system ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years , compared to the risks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic ampli@@ fiers Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the use of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with rite level of patients who had previously not been proven . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the time of approval from scientific reasons only limited information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited authori@@ zation for the establishment of as@@ gener@@ als throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- infected , Prot@@ e@@ as@@ sig@@ mer ( PI ) , pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years now appear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually , A@@ fra@@ ase capsules are supposed to be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ kl@@ ess of am@@ ic@@ avi@@ r along with low doses ranging from Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of Am@@ burst avi@@ r should take place in consideration of individual vir@@ al resistance patterns and the treatment of patients ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r as a solution to the intake is 14 % lower than the capsule ; therefore A@@ fra@@ ase capsules and solution for inser@@ tion on a milli@@ grams per milli@@ gram basis is not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for generic capsules is 600 mg of ampl@@ itu@@ des twice daily with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2 If generic capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fication of rite level ( boo@@ kl@@ ace ) , higher doses have to be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recommended dose for generic capsules is 20 mg of ampl@@ itu@@ des / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to one day of the day of 2400 mg am@@ ic@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of aging in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ e@@ as@@ tia were not examined in children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the lack of data for imp@@ em@@ ability and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose to adult patients should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver disorders on 300 mg twice daily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the simultaneous application should be done in patients with a slight or moderate liver function , in patients with severe liver interference it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with pharmaceuticals , which have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P3@@ A4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
herbal supplements that contain Johann@@ is@@ wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentration and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy do not lead to a cure of HIV infection , and that they may continue to develop opport@@ un@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with as@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transmission from HIV to others by sexual contact or contamination with blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses ranging from Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with a anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , have an increased risk of severe liver effects with potentially fatal course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the case of simultaneously viral treatment of Hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information about this medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function including a chronic @-@ active hepatitis show increased incidence of liver dys@@ functions under a anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ ason or other Glu@@ k@@ ok@@ or@@ ti@@ co@@ ids that are not recommended that the potential benefit of treatment according to Mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and supp@@ ression of the ep@@ ox@@ er@@ en@@ oid function ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or is strongly recommended by CY@@ P3@@ A4 because of the increased risk of my@@ op@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 4 For some medicines that may cause severe or threatening side effects , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International standardi@@ zation ratio ) , are available methods for determining active substances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients who take this medicine at the same time , A@@ fra@@ ase may be less effective because of reduced plasma mask ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with ampl@@ itu@@ des , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tives may be altered , but the information is not sufficient to estimate the kind of interactions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with ampl@@ itu@@ des , the patients should therefore be watched at O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ment symptoms , especially if also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are given . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the possible risk of tox@@ icity by the high risk of tox@@ icity , this formulation is contra@@ indicated by children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be set at duration 5 , when a rash of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ mer , was reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia or an expedition of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many patients had other diseases , whose therapy drugs were required to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B. a higher age , and with medication @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with hem@@ op@@ hil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , reports were treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ iah , reports about an increase of bleeding including spontaneous m@@ cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oma and hem@@ at@@ thro@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , HIV @-@ infected patients may develop an infl@@ amed reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opport@@ un@@ istic infections that leads to severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although a multi @-@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is adopted ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid , alcohol consumption , heavy Body Mass Index ) , cases of O@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ ros@@ is in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
CY@@ P3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width om@@ is@@ ase may not be used simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with a low therapeutic bread@@ th of A@@ general with mal@@ on@@ avi@@ r cannot be used together with medicines that are active predominantly via CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with increased purity and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ fli@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to a resistance development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attemp@@ ting to increase the resulting plasma level by a dose of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently unwanted effects were observed at the liver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cur@@ rants ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The ser@@ um mirrors of Am@@ burst avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous application of vegetable sugar@@ s with cur@@ rants ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a patient already takes cur@@ sor &apos;s wort , the ampl@@ itude and if possible , check the virus @-@ load and remove the cur@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a dose adjustment for one of the medicine is not required if nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is given together with Am@@ bert avi@@ r ( see also the ef@@ av@@ ir@@ enz below ) .
508 % increase for C@@ max by 30 % if rite ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of ampl@@ itu@@ des twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg were used twice daily , which determine the effectiveness and in@@ consistency of this treatment schem@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
52 % decreases when the ampl@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ fli@@ avi@@ r in the plasma , which were administered twice daily with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recommended dosage for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but it is recommended to provide a close monitoring because the effectiveness and lack of this combination is not known . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ o in combination with di@@ dan@@ o in combination , however , that the revenues of di@@ dan@@ o in and as@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore in combination with the gift of E@@ av@@ ir@@ enz in combination with ampl@@ itu@@ des ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tion required .
the treatment with ef@@ av@@ ir@@ enz in combination with Am@@ burst avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ tia would be reduced .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in to other prot@@ e@@ as@@ tia and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in had probably sun@@ k into the ser@@ um concentration of am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this medicine should be used simultaneously , caution is advisable because Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din might be less effective because of the reduced and possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this medicine can be applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be made , as an accurate forecast of the effect of the combination of ampl@@ itu@@ des and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the simultaneous gift of ampl@@ itu@@ des and ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin resulted in a rise in plasma concentration of 193 % and thus resulting in a rise in ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin @-@ related side effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is to be administered together with as@@ gener@@ ase , at least half of the recommended dose , although there is no clinical data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , however the plasma level of both medicines could be increased by the simultaneous administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ on avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day led to an increase in the C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day to increase the C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ el@@ avi@@ r with a simultaneous usage of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or induction of CY@@ P3@@ A4 can , if they can be used together with as@@ gener@@ ase , may cause interactions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should therefore be attached to toxic reactions which are associated with these medicines , if they are used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the data of other prot@@ e@@ as@@ tia , it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da cannot be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , as it can come to res@@ or@@ ption disorders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the simultaneous application of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ va that are known as enzymes are known ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with ampl@@ itu@@ des , lead to a decrease of the plasma level of ampl@@ itu@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium @-@ c@@ anti@@ block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , di@@ pine pin , pin pine , ni@@ m@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ m@@ di@@ pine , n@@ ano@@ di@@ pine and di@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ ate@@ via up to the activity and tox@@ icity of this drug . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; simultaneous taking with as@@ gener@@ ase , their plasma concentration may increase considerably and strengthen with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , tend@@ on disorders , and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a clinical study conducted in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g fluctu@@ ation pro@@ pion@@ ate int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days decreased ( 90 % reduction interval between 82 and 89 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended that the potential benefit of treatment will exceed the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ ling effects ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors like Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose nutrient change is strongly influenced by CY@@ P3@@ A4 , increases the enh@@ ancements of the plasma level while anticipated by as@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since plasma light increases in this H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ing to my@@ opathy , including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of these drugs with ampl@@ avi@@ r is not recommended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic levels until stabili@@ zation of the mirror , because the plasma concentration of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be further increased ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used together with oral int@@ ru@@ dent Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while on the same application of generic Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution is advisable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
data for simultaneous active mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors refer to a possible increase in the plasma level of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am to 3 to 4 fa@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with ampl@@ itu@@ des , the patients should therefore be watched at O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ment symptoms , especially if also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are given . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the small reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation to adapt , as the ampl@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while offering war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reinforced control of the IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or ampli@@ fication of the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the effect of an additional appointment of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tives is not predic@@ table as well as alternative methods for contra@@ c@@ eption is recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same gift of as@@ gener@@ als ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied during pregnancy after careful consideration of possible use for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the milk pud@@ ding rats were proven to am@@ burst avi@@ r @-@ related substances , however , it is not known whether am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r over humans into breast milk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recur@@ ring study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the emp@@ t@@ iness to the uter@@ us up to the end of the down@@ time am@@ id@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of 12 body weight in post@@ age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further development of income , including Fer@@ til@@ ity and Re@@ production capacity was not affected by the administration of Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r to the mother@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in adults and for children from 4 years of controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the side @-@ related side effects were slightly up to moderate , and rarely led to the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with many of these events , it is not clear whether they are used in connection with the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time for HIV treatment , or whether they are a result of the disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the above @-@ mentioned side effects are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients were not treated 1200 mg A@@ fra@@ ase two times daily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
events ( degree 2 to 4 ) which were evaluated by exam@@ ining the investig@@ ator as in connection with the study medication and were listed in more than 1 % of patients ( Grade 3 to 4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( li@@ ft@@ yst@@ roph@@ y ) in HIV patients , including a loss of periph@@ eral and cer@@ vical fat tissue , hyper@@ trop@@ h@@ ie of breasts and dor@@ so@@ vi@@ oral fat accumulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral not treated persons , which were treated with ampl@@ iv@@ ud@@ ine in combination with Lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ ine / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine over a medium length of 36 weeks , was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 for 245 patients with ampl@@ avi@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients with In@@ din@@ avi@@ r in combination with various N@@ RT@@ Is over a medium duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; skin erup@@ tions normally were mild to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ ed or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and disappeared spontane@@ ously during the second treatment week and disappeared spontane@@ ously within two weeks without leaving the treatment with ampl@@ itu@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
o@@ ste@@ on@@ s@@ rose cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , HIV @-@ infected patients may develop a inflam@@ matory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opport@@ un@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in combination with PI pre @-@ treated patients , which were observed twice daily with low dos@@ ed rite levels ( Grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 2 to 4 ) and C@@ p@@ k values which were treated with low dos@@ ed rite levels , were used very frequently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of over@@ dos@@ ing , the patient is to observe in signs of an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) when necessary , necessary supporting measures are necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the anti@@ viral activity in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied in acute and chronic lympho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F ( H@@ 9 ) as well as periph@@ eral blood cells .
the 50 % Hem@@ i concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) from Am@@ wi@@ avi@@ r is found in the range from 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the connection between the activity of am@@ locom@@ avi@@ r on HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication is not defined yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
treated with the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment with the present Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / rite @-@ dos@@ ages were observed - as with other rite @-@ inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described only rarely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in sixteen cases of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment , the 700@@ mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r obtained twice daily in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study twice daily , whereby 14 isol@@ ates could be examined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of isol@@ ates from 13 out of 14 children , with which a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred within 59 patients , showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ 11 @-@ Algorith@@ m for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance than the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / C / M / G / M / G / M / G / M / G / M / G / M / G / M / G / M / G / M / G / M / G / M / G / M / S / M / G / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M / S / M /
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation samples can be subject to additional data , and it is recommended to draw the current interpretation systems to analyse resistance tests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on ph@@ otyp@@ ical resistance tests clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpre@@ ting systems can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for the esti@@ mation of the activity of ampl@@ ona / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ tia @-@ resistant ins@@ ulates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have been clin@@ ically developed clin@@ ically phen@@ otyp@@ ic Cut @-@ offs ( separation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be applied to interpretation of a resistance tests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ burst avi@@ r associated genetic patterns , however , produces a certain cross@@ roads against the In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are currently data for the cru@@ ises between Am@@ burst avi@@ r and other prot@@ e@@ as@@ tia for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r Resistance , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment patients with which a Fos@@ amp@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 ins@@ ulates ) and the qu@@ in@@ qu@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 ins@@ ulates ) and the Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 ins@@ ulates ) and the Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 ins@@ ulates ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the revers@@ al re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ tia @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; early waste of a fail@@ ing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in boundaries , which can affect the following treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the validity of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with rite levels of 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ on@@ tro@@ al@@ oga ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ on@@ tro@@ al@@ oga ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ avi@@ al@@ oga ( 100 mg twice daily ) and the nucle@@ o@@ avi@@ r ( standard of care ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one hundred and sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with im@@ post@@ ulated virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the primary analysis introduced the non @-@ sub@@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the time @-@ adjusted average change of the output value ( HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA ) in the plasma for 16 weeks with a non @-@ shift shaft of 0,4 @-@ 10 copies / ml .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the validity of the efficacy of un@@ le@@ oo@@ ster@@ ated as@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving a total of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 years , of which 152 have been pre@@ treated with PI . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in studies , A@@ fra@@ ase has been studied daily , 20 mg / kg daily , 20 mg / kg daily , 20 mg / kg daily and 2@@ 2,5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no low dos@@ ed rite level given at the same time ; the majority of the patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ RT@@ Is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients enrolled in the study included a plasma @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell number from 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on these data should be considered at therapy optimisation , with PI pre @-@ treated children who are expected to consider &quot; un@@ booked &quot; as@@ gener@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) up to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of ampl@@ itu@@ des approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approx . 0,5 to 1 hour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
508 % increase for C@@ max by 30 % if rite level ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered together with ampl@@ itu@@ des ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administration of Am@@ burst avi@@ r with a meal lead to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of ampl@@ itu@@ des 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the minimal concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the dietary intake , although the increase of the condition and the rate of res@@ or@@ ption was affected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent field of distribution is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be linked to a large distribution volume as well as a hin@@ dered penetration of the blood circulation in the tissue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of active substance in plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound ampl@@ itu@@ des which constitutes the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ id@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredients during the dos@@ ing concentration in the Ste@@ ady State via the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , medicines that in@@ duce CY@@ P3@@ A4 or inhi@@ bit or inhi@@ bit the sub@@ strate of CY@@ P3@@ A4 if they are given simultaneously with as@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice per kg / kg daily , leads to a similar daily ampl@@ itu@@ des exposure such as adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r is made from the solution 14 % less bi@@ over@@ feed as out of the capsules , so A@@ gener@@ a solution and as@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a Milli@@ ons basis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ al clearing of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also negli@@ gible , so the impact of a kidney distur@@ b@@ ance on the elim@@ ination of Am@@ wi@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is likely to be minimal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these treatment schem@@ ata lead to am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r plasma light equivalent to those that are achieved in healthy volunteers according to a dose of 1200 mg of ampl@@ itu@@ des twice daily , without simultaneous administration of rite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in long @-@ term studies on the carcin@@ ogen@@ icity with ampl@@ itu@@ des in mice and rats , the exposure involving human animals ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure involving individuals , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of ampl@@ itu@@ des , said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ at@@ ogen@@ ous cell @-@ aden@@ omes and carcin@@ omas were not solved , and the relevance of the observed effects for human beings is un@@ clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of the existing expos@@ ures data on humans , both clinical trials and therapeutic use , however , little evidence for the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , micro@@ kernel testing on human periph@@ eral lympho@@ cytes , Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ ag@@ ox@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and demonstrated in clinical daily life through the measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , in clinical trials no significant liver tox@@ icity was observed in patients , neither during the administration of a@@ generative ase after the end of the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; studies on the tox@@ icity in young animals treated with a high level of 4 days , showed a high mortality rate during the inspection as well as with ampl@@ itu@@ des with ampl@@ itu@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at system@@ ic plasma exposure , significantly lower ( rats ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) as the expected exposure under therapeutic dosage , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ m@@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ eton changes were observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 24 If generic capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fication of rite level ( boo@@ kl@@ ace ) , higher doses have to be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recommended dose for generic capsules is 20 mg of ampl@@ itu@@ des / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to one day of the day of 2400 mg am@@ ic@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the simultaneous application should be done in patients with low or easier liver interference with caution , in patients with severe liver interference it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 26 For some medicines that may cause serious or threatening side effects , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International standardi@@ zation ratio ) , are available methods for determining active substances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be set at length 27 if a rash of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an increased risk for a li@@ yst@@ roph@@ y was associated with individual factors , such as a higher age , and with medication @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ fli@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to a resistance development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
508 % increase for C@@ max by 30 % if rite ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ fli@@ avi@@ r in the plasma , which were administered twice daily with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recommended dosage for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but it is recommended to provide a close monitoring because the effectiveness and lack of this combination is not known . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the treatment with ef@@ av@@ ir@@ enz in combination with Am@@ burst avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ tia would be reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this medicine can be applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be made , as an accurate forecast of the effect of the combination of ampl@@ itu@@ des and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is advised along with as@@ gener@@ ase , to reduce the dose of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there is no clinical data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium @-@ c@@ anti@@ block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , di@@ pine pin , pin pine , ni@@ m@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ m@@ di@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can increase the activity and tox@@ icity of this drug . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a clinical study conducted in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g fluctu@@ ation pro@@ pion@@ ate int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days decreased ( 90 % reduction interval between 82 and 89 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while offering war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reinforced control of the IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or ampli@@ fication of the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.@@ 0@@ 35 mg eth@@ in@@ y@@ le@@ ti@@ di@@ ol plus 1,0 mg No@@ re@@ th@@ ind@@ ron ) lead to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min from Am@@ mah avi@@ r 22 % or about 22 % respectively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied during pregnancy after careful consideration of possible use for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recur@@ ring study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the emp@@ t@@ iness to the uter@@ us up to the end of the breast@@ feeding in the uter@@ us until the end of the down@@ time showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in adults and for children from 4 years of controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of over@@ dos@@ ing , the patient is to observe in signs of an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) when necessary , necessary supporting measures are necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the anti@@ viral activity in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied in acute and chronic lympho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F ( H@@ 9 ) as well as periph@@ eral blood cells .
the 50 % Hem@@ i concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) from Am@@ wi@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M for acute infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the revers@@ al re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ tia @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on these data , pre @-@ treated children should be considered an unexpected benefit from &quot; un@@ le@@ oo@@ ster@@ ling &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ bush avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredients in the Ste@@ ady State via the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , medicines that in@@ duce CY@@ P3@@ A4 or inhi@@ bit or inhi@@ bit the sub@@ strate of CY@@ P3@@ A4 if they are given simultaneously with as@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ren@@ al clearing of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also negli@@ gi@@ bly ; therefore the impact of a kidney distur@@ b@@ ance on the elim@@ ination of Am@@ h@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is likely to be minimal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in long @-@ term studies on the carcin@@ ogen@@ icity with ampl@@ itu@@ des in mice and rats , the exposure involving human animals ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure involving individuals after twice daily gift of 1200 mg is am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ul@@ ary aden@@ omes and carcin@@ omas were not solved and the relevance of the observed effects for human beings is un@@ clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , of the existing expos@@ ures data am human , both clinical trials and therapeutic use however , little evidence for the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro pl@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , the bacterial reverse os@@ yn@@ x test , micro@@ kernel test on human periph@@ eral lympho@@ cytes , was neither mut@@ iny nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; studies on the tox@@ icity in young animals treated with a high level of 4 days , showed a high mortality rate during the inspection as well as with ampl@@ itu@@ des with ampl@@ itu@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these results can be concluded that in young , the metabolism are not fully rans@@ acked , so am@@ ble@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ fra@@ ase solution is used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , Prot@@ e@@ as@@ sig@@ mer ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase &quot; solution was not treated with PI pre @-@ treated patients with PI pre @-@ treated patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r as a solution to the intake is 14 % lower than the capsule ; therefore A@@ fra@@ ase capsules and solution for inser@@ tion on a milli@@ grams per milli@@ gram basis is not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be able to swallow the capsules , as soon as they are able to swallow up the capsules with taking the solution ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ fra@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ fli@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2800 mg of ampl@@ ona which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; additionally , there is no dose recommended for the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to dispos@@ ing and low dos@@ ing Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be avoided to avoid this combination with these patient groups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although a dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tion for Am@@ burst avi@@ r is not considered to be necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of high pro@@ py@@ l gly@@ col , A@@ gener@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive inhibit@@ ing of the metabolism , possibly causing serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy do not lead to a cure of HIV infection , and that they continue to develop opport@@ un@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with as@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of 47 from HIV to others by sexual contact or contamination with blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for some drugs such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International standardi@@ zation ratio ) , are available methods for determining active substances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be set on duration if a rash of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an increased risk for a li@@ yst@@ roph@@ y was associated with individual factors , such as a higher age , and with drugs - 49 dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with hem@@ op@@ hil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , reports were treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ iah , reports about an increase of bleeding including spontaneous m@@ cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oma and hem@@ at@@ thro@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ fli@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to a resistance development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
508 % increase for C@@ max by 30 % if rite ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; simultaneous taking with as@@ gener@@ ase , their plasma concentration may increase considerably , and lead with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , tend@@ on disorders , and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the data to 54 other CY@@ P3@@ A4 In@@ hibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am significantly increased significantly higher plasma concentration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ gener@@ a solution to get involved may not be applied during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us in the pregnancy ( see section 4.3 ) .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recur@@ ring study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the emp@@ t@@ iness to the uter@@ us up to the end of the down@@ time Am@@ h@@ met@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of 55 body weight in post@@ age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in adults and for children from 4 years of controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with many of these events , it is not clear whether they are used in connection with the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time for HIV treatment , or whether they are a result of the disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cream is fertili@@ zed before bed@@ time to add the affected skin surfaces , so that they will remain sufficient for a long time ( about eight hours ) before being washed away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all trials Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with plac@@ ebo ( the same cream , but without the active substance ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies at 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main indi@@ an indicator for efficacy was the number of patients treated with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two trials , during which patients were treated for six weeks or plac@@ ebo either daily or five times per week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream is so long to continue , until all visible war@@ nings of genital or peri@@ ors are missing , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment process should be considered when intensive local inflammation occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or when in the treatment area an infection is observed .
if the follow @-@ up examination of 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated l@@ esi@@ ons should only be incomplete and another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if one dose was om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she noticed this and then proceed with the usual therapy plan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream is recycled into a thin layer and rub in the st@@ oned , infected skin area until the cream is completely fenced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it should take a consideration between the benefits of treatment using I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , and the risk associated with a possible loss of auto@@ immune disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these patients , a consideration was done between the benefit of a treatment using I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risks associated with a possible organ and gra@@ ft versus dec@@ ei@@ - reaction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in other studies , in which no daily pre@@ h@@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene were performed , two cases of severe Phi@@ mos@@ is and one case were observed with a leading Stri@@ c@@ ture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream in higher than the recommended doses there is a higher risk of severe local skin irritation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irritation were also observed , which made treatment necessary and / or to a temporary physical impair@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in cases where such reactions took place at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had trouble passing urine , which required an emergency cath@@ eter and treatment of the affected area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to apply I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream directly in connection to treatment with other cut@@ aneous means applied to the treatment of external fever , no clinical experiences have been used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited data suggest an increased rate of fine @-@ interest reductions in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream has shown in this patient group with regard to the removal of the p@@ inc@@ ers but a lower effectiveness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the treatment of Bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , the nose , the lips , or hair set has not been studied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions take in general during the therapy or the reactions form the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the complaints of the patient or due to the sever@@ ity of the local skin reactions , a treatment period can be made of several days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the regeneration of the treated skin , the clinical result of therapy can be evaluated approximately 12 weeks after the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since there are currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment , other suitable treatment methods should be moved in consideration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , no clinical experiences are available , therefore the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ osis on the fore@@ arms and hands do not support the efficacy in this application , therefore such an application is not recommended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions normally occur after the therapy in intensity or go back after placing the therapy with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if local skin reactions may cause large dis@@ comfort to the patient , the treatment can be exposed for a few days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of the data from an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 files showed a lower complete healing rate compared to patients with less than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to immun@@ ity stimul@@ ating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with caution when patients receiving a immune supp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; animal studies do not leave any direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / red@@ dish development , the binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is not yet possible after unique top@@ ical use ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) , no recommendation can be given during breast@@ feeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most commonly assigned and probably with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream , related side effects in the studies with three weekly treatment were local reactions in the treatment of the fever ( 3@@ 3.7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od patients ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most frequently reported and probably , possibly , possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream in the related side effects include complaints at the application location with an incidence of 28,@@ 1 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream , Bas@@ ali@@ oma patients treated from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical study reported side effects are shown below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common , probably or possibly with the application of the i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream in the related side effects were a reaction on the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od patients ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the side effects produced by 252 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ osis , are listed below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these according to test plan presented by clinical signs shows that in these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials including i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream are frequently added to local skin reactions including Er@@ y@@ them ( 61 % ) , ex@@ foli@@ ation / evenings ( 23 % ) and o@@ des ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these according to test plan presented by clinical evidence shows that in these studies with a five times of weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , severe ero@@ sion and sh@@ rest@@ ation ( 19 % ) came . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials for exam@@ ining the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ osis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with an incidence of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) in the area of treatment or in the surrounding area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extraordinary unique recording of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags , might cause nausea , vom@@ iting , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg was norm@@ alized in hyp@@ ot@@ onia , which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous liquid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , increasing system@@ ic concentrations of alpha inter@@ fer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were demonstrated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 3 per@@ cep@@ tive phase 3 efficacy studies , it could be shown that the effectiveness in relation to a complete wound healing of the fever therapy is superior to over 16 weeks of plac@@ ebo treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at 60 % of the total 119 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapies , the cow@@ ards healed them completely ; this was 20 % of the 105 with plac@@ ebo patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a complete allocation could be achieved in 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od male patients treated against 5 % of 161 with plac@@ ebo @-@ treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od during five time application per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed individual primary super@@ fi@@ zi@@ elle bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data from an open , un@@ controlled and long @-@ term study after four years of present data suggest that approximately 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) were treated clin@@ ically and this remained for 48 months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effectiveness of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od during three weeks of weekly application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week @-@ treated period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hysi@@ cal , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ esi@@ ons within a con@@ nex@@ ion 25 c@@ m2 of large treatment are@@ als on the hair@@ less scal@@ p or face . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the income data from two combined observation studies indicate a Re@@ zi@@ di@@ v@@ rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) , for patients with clinical separation studies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the approved indications , ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ osis , and super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma usually occur at pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients and were therefore not examined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ dar@@ a cream was examined in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials in children aged 2 to 15 years with m@@ oll@@ us@@ cum cont@@ ag@@ ios@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these studies , the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks bz@@ w . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
minimal system@@ ic absorption of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ osis was observed during the three times of weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest Drug concentrations in ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and bet@@ ru@@ gen 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml during the use in the face ( 25@@ mg , 2 bags ) and on the head / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated half @-@ value time was about 10@@ times higher than the 2@@ hour half @-@ time after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in a previous study ; this indicates an extended Ret@@ ention of Drug with the skin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the data of system@@ ic exposure showed that the absorption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od following top@@ ical application was low in the age of 6 to 12 years and comparable to the healthy adult and adult patients with ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ osis or super@@ fi@@ zi@@ l bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a four month study on the paint tox@@ icity in a rat of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg significantly reduced body weight and increased mil@@ z weight ; one also four months long @-@ run study for the paint application showed no similar effects in the mouse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a two @-@ year study of carcin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice in two days per week does not induced any tum@@ ors at the application .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only one low system@@ ic absorption from human skin and not mut@@ agen is a risk to look at the system@@ ic exposure due to system@@ ic exposure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tum@@ ors were treated in the group of mice , which was treated with the nutrient @-@ free cream , previously used in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can harm other people even if they have the same symptoms as you . − If any of the listed side effects are significant , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
● foot@@ p@@ ples ( Con@@ d@@ yl@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) created on the skin in the area of gen@@ itali@@ a ( gen@@ itals ) and An@@ us ( After ) created a superf@@ icial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with very low probability of spreading on other parts of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it remains un@@ treated , it may lead to resolutions , in particular in the face - therefore a screening test is important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ osis are harsh areas of the skin which occur with people , who were exposed to sunlight during their previous life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ dar@@ a should only be applied with a healthy immune system in the face and on the scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is the best suitable treatment .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream supports your body &apos;s own immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body to fight the superf@@ icial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ osis or the virus infection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O If you have already used Al@@ dar@@ a cream or other , similar preparations , please inform Al@@ dar@@ a cream until you have problems with your immune system . o A@@ void having problems with your eyes , lips and nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you acci@@ dentally contact the cream by r@@ ins@@ ing with water . don &apos;t use cream instead of using Al@@ dar@@ a cream without any in@@ convenience caused by Al@@ dar@@ a cream , you do not wash the cream with a mild soap and water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the reactions are dis@@ closed , you can take care of your doctor if they don &apos;t have a normal blood picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this daily cleansing is not performed under the fo@@ res@@ kin , the skin or difficulties can be calculated if the skin or difficulty passing the fo@@ res@@ kin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do not apply Al@@ dar@@ a cream in the ureth@@ ra ( ureth@@ ra ) in the vagina ( vagina ) and cer@@ vical ( uter@@ ine cer@@ vi@@ x ) or within the anus ( anus ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking other drugs serious problems with your immune system , you should use this medication for no more than a treatment course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have intercourse during the infection with cow@@ ards in the genital area , the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream is performed after intercourse ( not previously ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you apply other medicines or recently used , even if it is not prescri@@ ption drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frequency and duration of treatment are different with fever , bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma and ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ osis ( see specific instructions for each application area ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wear a thin layer Al@@ dar@@ a cream on the clean , dry skin with the ti@@ lt and rub the cream gently on your skin until the cream is completely fenced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
men with cow@@ ries under the fo@@ res@@ kin must remove the skin every day and wash the skin area underneath ( see Section 2 &quot; What must you consider before using Al@@ dar@@ a cream ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have the impression that the effect of al@@ dar@@ a is too strong or weak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for 6 weeks each week , apply a sufficient amount of Al@@ dar@@ a cream to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

inform your doctor / your doctor / pharmac@@ ist / pharmac@@ ist instantly when you feel at ease during the use of Al@@ dar@@ a cream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your skin reacts strongly to the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , you should not continue the cream to wash the affected area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a hum@@ bled number of blood cells may make you vulnerable to infections ; it can cause you to create a blue stain , or she can cause distra@@ ction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects will be significantly im@@ paired or you will notice any side effects that are not listed in this use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , you can find it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) or pain in the areas where you applied to Al@@ dar@@ a cream ( 8 % of patients ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is usually about easier skin reactions , which res@@ umes the treatment within about 2 weeks after placing the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; occasionally some patients notice changes in the application location ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , swelling , shame , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ability , nausea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and fatigue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; occasionally , some patients suffer from change in the application location ( Blu@@ ed , inflam@@ ma@@ tions , wound secre@@ tion , swelling or flu ) , depression , eye irritation , swelling , mim@@ ic pain , fever , weakness , or ch@@ ills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for the enzyme therapy in patients with secured diagnosis of a Mu@@ c@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ de deficiency ( symptoms that are not related to the brain or nerves in connection ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that certain substances ( gly@@ co@@ her@@ og@@ l@@ ly@@ kan@@ e , g@@ ags ) are not disman@@ tled and thus accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body , and these are damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following non @-@ neurolog@@ ical symptoms of the M@@ PS I may occur : enlarged liver , sti@@ ff joints , complic@@ ate movements , reduced lung volume , heart and eye disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be supervised by a doctor that has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be performed in a hospital or hospital with re@@ vit@@ alization equipment , and patients need appropriate medicines to prevent an allergic reaction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study , mainly the safety of drugs was investigated , but it was also measured by its effectiveness ( by investig@@ ating the concentration of G@@ ag @-@ concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in children under five years old Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me the G@@ ag @-@ concentrations in the urine rose by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal great liver at the end of the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me at the age of over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nausea , abdominal pain , skin rash , pain and reactions on the in@@ fusion agency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very frequent side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of lung function ) and speed@@ ometer ( accelerated blood pressure ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may react to patients who may be highly sensitive to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ tic reaction ) , not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will evaluate all new information that may be known to , and update this abstract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , will observe the reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of anti@@ bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission approved Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. to provide permission for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using Ch@@ o @-@ mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ stock of the Chinese ham@@ sters ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for the long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with secured diagnosis of a Mu@@ c@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ de deficiency in patients to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be performed by a doctor that has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient carries this to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes in single steps .
safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years was not determined and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients , patients may develop in@@ fusion reactions which are defined as any related side effect , which occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , these patients should also be supervised close mes@@ hed and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be provided in appropriate clinical conditions , in the re@@ vit@@ ational equipment for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the clinical Phase 3 study , almost all patients Ig@@ G antibody to be found against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the treatment begins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients who develop anti@@ bodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion reaction , must be handled using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with caution ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as little experience in the recovery of treatment after a longer inter@@ ruption , due to the theore@@ tically increased risk action has to be cau@@ tious after an inter@@ ruption of treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with drugs ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti py@@ py@@ re@@ tics ) to minimize the potential occurrence of un@@ authorized reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of light or medium @-@ heavy in@@ fusion reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate , in which the reaction has occurred . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of a single , heavy in@@ fusion reaction the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are brought to decline , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is too weak@@ ened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ fusion can be res@@ umed with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate , when the reaction has occurred again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
3 are used ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of in@@ fusion rates on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or pro@@ ca@@ ine because a potential risk of interference with the intra@@ cellular intake of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experimental studies do not apply to direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exp@@ on@@ ated towards the mother &apos;s milk , is recommended to not breast@@ feed during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the side effects in clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients were observed in patients under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
unwanted medication reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me which were observed during the period of 5 years or older in a duration of 45 patients ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory system and lungs in the pre@@ history there were severe reactions , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ mus , breathing and facial oils ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children Un@@ wanted medication related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , reported in a phase of 20 patients with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 , reported in the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most patients received it within 3 months after the treatment of a Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version , with a severe disin@@ teg@@ ration form usually within 5 years ( average after 26 days against 45 days of patients at the age of 5 and older ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or until a premature ej@@ ecting of the study ) , 13 / 45 patients were not det@@ ectable by Radio@@ immun@@ op@@ cip@@ ation ( R@@ IP ) As@@ say , which had never been to Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients with lack@@ ed up to low anti@@ viral levels showed a robust reduction of G@@ ag @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els in Har@@ n , while in patients with high anti@@ bodies to determine a variable reduction of G@@ ag in the har@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four patients ( three in the Phase 3 study and one in the Phase 2 study showed a mar@@ ginal to low neutr@@ alising effect on the enzy@@ matic lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro which does not affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ ag in the hard@@ n .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the presence of anti@@ bodies seemed to stand not in connection with the incidence of adverse drug reactions , even if the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G anti@@ bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the jus@@ tification for the enzyme therapy is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of accumulated sub@@ str@@ ats , preventing further accumulation of adequate restoration of the activity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and cells into ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ 3 study enrolled 45 to 43 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the majority of patients were recru@@ ited from the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ iratory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand for 6 minutes and 5 metres .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute walking distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all patients were recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received more 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients were treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me to improve lung function and en@@ vi@@ ability , which is shown in the following table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintain this effect of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as shown from the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically significant over this period and the absolute lung volume increased further in proportion to the height of the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the 26 patients with a h@@ ep@@ tic h@@ esi@@ ve treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study , a normal liver size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the first 4 weeks a clear waste of the G@@ ag mirror in Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg of Kre@@ at@@ arg@@ in@@ ine ) was noted , which remained constant until the end of the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the hetero@@ geneous disease event between the patients , which was taken into account by using a combined end point , observed clin@@ ically significant changes across 10 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and wor@@ sen@@ ing in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was conducted a one year @-@ old Phase 2 study , which was mainly investig@@ ating the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me at 20 patients ( 16 patients with a heavy aband@@ on@@ ment form and 4 with the middle aband@@ on@@ ment form ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in four patients , the dosage due to increased casting mirrors in the har@@ n increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in several patients a mag@@ nit@@ ude ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was found according to the mean age group ( n = 3 ) and all 4 patients with the mean age form only limited or no progress in cognitive development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a Phase 4 study , investigations of pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me met@@ ering schem@@ as were performed on the g@@ ag mirror in the har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can be represented in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dos@@ ing schem@@ as is equivalent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will evaluate any new information , which will evaluate each year , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the medication will be updated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients under 5 years of age was similar to the patients affected by older and less affected patients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on conventional studies on security mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in unique gift and reproduction , the pre@@ ventive data do not recognize any particular dangers for humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients who suffer from M@@ PS I , there is an enzyme called &quot; -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase that certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ og@@ l@@ ly@@ kan@@ e ) , either entirely missing , or this enzyme is missing completely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you are allergic to any of the ingredients of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have occurred a serious allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
an in@@ fusion @-@ conditional reaction is any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion ( see section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible ) .
when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines please inform your doctor if you are using drugs that contain chlorine o@@ qu@@ in or pro@@ ca@@ in because a possible risk of reduced effect from Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me exists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken , including non @-@ prescri@@ ption medication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
indications for handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate on production of an in@@ fusion solution must be diluted in prior to application and is intended for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors or medical staff ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient carries this , every 15 minutes gradually increases to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - conditional participation of the upper respiratory system and lungs in the pre @-@ history nevertheless heavy reactions came up , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ mus , breathing and facial oils . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very frequently ( occurrence at more than 1 of 10 patients ) : • head@@ aches • nausea • abdominal pain • skin pain , joint pain , pain in the arms and legs • vom@@ iting or less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the in@@ fusion office
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will evaluate any new information , which will evaluate each year , and if necessary , the package will be updated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Ali@@ m@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pla@@ tin ( a different drug against cancer ) in patients which can not be removed from cancer compared to other parts of the body ( cancer or cancer ) or are probably spreading on other parts of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ali@@ m@@ ta is treated with patients who have previously not been treated , in combination with C@@ is@@ pla@@ tin and in patients who previously had already applied other chemotherapy regim@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to reduce side effects , patients during treatment with Ali@@ m@@ ta should take cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and get inj@@ ections of vitamin B12 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Ali@@ m@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pla@@ tin , a &quot; anti @-@ therapeutic agent &quot; ( drug against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent dehy@@ dra@@ tion to prevent dehy@@ dra@@ tion ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients whose blood is changed or with which certain other side effects occur , treatment should be pushed up , canc@@ eled or decreases the dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ rack slow@@ s down the formation of the DNA and RNA , thereby preventing the cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the transformation of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in its active form is easier than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of drug and a longer active time in cancer cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ othel@@ i@@ oms , Ali@@ m@@ ta was studied in a study study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously received chemotherapy against their disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effects of ali@@ m@@ ta in a study were compared with chemotherapy in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metast@@ asis , compared with chemotherapy with the effects of doc@@ et@@ a@@ xel ( another drug against cancer ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ali@@ m@@ ta was compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , and in combination with c@@ is@@ pla@@ tin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who previously had no chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients who were treated with Ali@@ m@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pla@@ tin had an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.3 months during the sole administration of C@@ is@@ pla@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients who previously received chemotherapy was the average survival time with Ali@@ m@@ ta 8.3 months , compared with 7.9 months at doc@@ et@@ a@@ xel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however in both studies , patients who were not diagnosed with the epithel@@ ium cells when cancer was diagnosed by ali@@ m@@ ta during the administration of Ali@@ m@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. for the establishment of Ali@@ m@@ ta in the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
each water bottle must be dissolved with 4,2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) which gives a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary Do@@ - S@@ IS is taken in the flow bottle and diluted with a 0.9 % sodium chloride inj@@ ector solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pla@@ tin indicated for the first @-@ line therapy of patients with locally advanced or metastatic col@@ o@@ carcin@@ oma ( see Section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in mono is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ single bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ oma ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion about a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment course .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pla@@ tin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion about a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after finishing the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment course .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ oma after previous chemotherapy is the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F . the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for reducing the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , the day before and on the day of the em@@ et@@ re@@ xed gift as well as the day after treatment a cor@@ ti@@ ko@@ ster@@ oid had to be given . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ rack , at least 5 doses of fol@@ ate must be taken and the intake must be continued during the entire therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients must also receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ rack dose and after each third movement cycle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients who received the em@@ et@@ rack , a complete blood image should be created prior to each gift , including a differentiation of the leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and a thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te story . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ at trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ in trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should amount to ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the start of a new therapy cycle , a dose @-@ examination is taking place under the rec@@ u@@ per@@ ation of Na@@ di@@ rs of the blood image or maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the pre@@ mat@@ ing therapy cycles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the recovery , the patients need to be treated accordingly to the tables in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , to apply for AL@@ IM@@ TA as a monthly or in combination with C@@ is@@ pla@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these criteria meet the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should patients be non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if in patients after 2 dos@@ is@@ sions a hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity level 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ on@@ ically when the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies did not notice that in patients at age 65 years or in comparison to patients in the age 65 years an increased by @-@ effectively idi@@ os@@ - ko exists .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to non @-@ sufficient data for imp@@ em@@ ability and effectiveness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials , patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min does not need to go to dose adap@@ tations required for all patients recommended dose adap@@ tations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however patients with a liver function of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ases of the upper limit value ( at the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.@@ 0 @-@ times of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specially examined in studies .
patients must be monitored with regard to the bone mar@@ row and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be given to patients once again a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ m@@ hole figure has a value of ≥ 100.000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose @-@ reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of the absolute neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ en@@ sic count and maximum @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity as they were observed in the preceding treatment cycles - ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ chth@@ mat@@ ology tox@@ icity such as neutr@@ rop@@ en@@ ie and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie has taken place when a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 had occurred .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , all patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients need to be used in fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 as well as proph@@ y- lac@@ tic measure ( see paragraph 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous in@@ ster@@ oid anti @-@ inflam@@ matory drugs ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all patients , intended for treatment with p@@ em@@ et@@ rack , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDs for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many patients with which these events occurred , had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including dehy@@ dra@@ tion , existing high blood pressure or diabetes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid buil@@ du@@ p collection in the transc@@ ul@@ ary space a drainage of the result will be considered before the p@@ em@@ et@@ rack treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 5 Seri@@ ous cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events contained in clinical trials in combination with a different cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , the same use atten@@ u@@ ate vital substances ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ cep@@ tive ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible cran@@ ial condition is to be pointed out by P@@ em@@ et@@ ra@@ xed , men should be advised before the treatment of G@@ inn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since no data has been submitted to the interaction potenti@@ als with N@@ SA@@ IDs , such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the t@@ inn@@ ess status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires a increased surveillance frequency of the IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient du@@ cks with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed during pregnant women , but as at an@@ de@@ - and an@@ timet@@ abol@@ ites are expected severe birth defects in pregnancy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they can not dimin@@ ish some fat in the food , which yields about a quarter of food associated with food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a third study , alli was compared with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with plac@@ ebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the two trials of patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients had a total weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared with 2.3 kg when taking plac@@ ebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study with alli in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , there could be no more relevant weight loss for patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

it must not be applied in patients who are treated with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ of transplan@@ ting ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in for preventing blood cl@@ ots .
it may also not be applied in patients who suffer from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( with which non @-@ insufficient nutrients from the digestive tract ) or to ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( a liver disease ) or with pregnant mothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in July 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited authori@@ zation of the agency of Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
alli is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body Mass Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ o @-@ fat @-@ fat diet .
alli is not allowed to be used by children and young@@ sters under 18 since there are insufficient data on efficacy and safety .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , or@@ list@@ at is only minimal res@@ or@@ tive , is necessary in elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
• Pre@@ gn@@ ation against the active substance or any of the other components • Premature Mal@@ absorption syndrome • ch@@ ol@@ ec@@ ase • pregnancy ( see section 4.6 ) • Still time ( see section 4.6 ) • nursing treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.8 )
the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) can take up if alli is taken along with a low @-@ fat meal or low @-@ fat diet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the weight reduction in diabetes can be reached with an improved metabolic check , patients suffering from diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist prior to treatment with alli gains a doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients , the alli , and drug against hypertension or an increased Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel , should ask if the dose of this drug should be adjusted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is recommended to meet additional fluctu@@ ating measures in order to prevent the oral contra@@ c@@ eps in case of severe diarr@@ hoea ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study on the effects of pharmaceuticals as well as in several cases of simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a reduction of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma plates was observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in combination with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values ( internationally standar@@ dised ratio , IN@@ R ) might be affected ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in most patients receiving clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at were treated , the concentration of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta @-@ carot@@ enes remained in the norm range . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , patients should be recommended to take a supplement of supplements to ensure adequate vitamin intake ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the gift of a single dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a limited number of healthy volunteers , which at the same time received or@@ list@@ at once received a slight decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on plasma concentration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experimental studies did not show direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intestinal nature and are associated with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the medication , as the absorption of frozen fat is prevented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
gast@@ ro@@ intestinal effects were determined from clinical trials involving or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally easy and temporary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the skins are defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , but not known ( frequency on the basis of available data not in@@ valuable ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frequency of those side effects that were noted after the launch of Or@@ list@@ at is not known , as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of un@@ certain@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
† It is plau@@ sible that the treatment with alli gains effect on potential or actual gast@@ ro@@ intestinal effects .
individual doses of 800 mg of Or@@ list@@ at and multiple columns of up to 400 mg three times daily have been administered by normal important and overweight people without significant clinical findings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the majority of Or@@ list@@ at @-@ over@@ dos@@ ing reported , no side effects or similar effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on human and animal studies , from a fast retro@@ formation of any system@@ ic effects that are attri@@ but@@ able to the li@@ pas@@ tive properties of or@@ list@@ at , can be assumed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the therapeutic effect uses the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper thin film by co@@ valent bonds of the active ser@@ ene and pan@@ kre@@ atic li@@ pas@@ en . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clinical trials was derived from clinical trials that 60 mg of Or@@ list@@ at is taken three times daily , the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food @-@ fat are blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised controlled trials in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 occupy the efficacy of 60 mg of Or@@ list@@ at that was taken three times daily in combination with hypo@@ kal@@ or@@ ical , fatty nutrition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the primary parameter , the change of body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ ization ) , has been rated as the percentage of the body weight in the course of study ( table 1 ) and more than 10 % of their output weight ( table 2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even though in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the biggest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the average change in the overall ch@@ ol@@ esterin amounted to 60 mg @-@ 2.4 % ( output value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( output level 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in the L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg @-@ 3.5 % ( output level 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( output level 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

plasma concentrations of non @-@ metabolic or@@ list@@ at were not measur@@ able 8 hours after the oral gift of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .

overweight has an effect on your health and increases the risk for the formation of various serious diseases such as : • hypertension • diabetes • determination of canc@@ ers • o@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis Please consult your doctor about your risk for these disorders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a permanent weight loss , for example by improving the diet and more movement , can prevent serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choose meals , which contain a wide range of nutrients , and learn to feed themselves permanently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; energy is also measured in Kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ le , which you can also find the recommended cal@@ orie intake , how many calories you should take maximum per day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note the tables below in this section below . • The recommended fat supply in grams is the maximum amount of fat , which you should take with each meal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what quantity is appropriate for you , refer to the below information that gives the number of calories available which is appropriate for you . • To ensure the recommended intake of the capsule is crucial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , it can mean that your body can &apos;t process the amount of fat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by adher@@ ence to the recommended fat supply , you can maxim@@ ize weight loss and reduce the probability of nutrition @-@ related accompanying symptoms . • You should try to gradually increase gradually . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 34 These low cal@@ orie intake should allow you to gradually lose weight and continuously lose weight about 0.5 kg per week without fru@@ strations and dis@@ appoint@@ ments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; low physical activity &quot; means that you work daily 150 kcal per day , e.g. due to 3 km walking , 30@@ - to 45 @-@ minute garden work or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • For permanent weight loss , it is necessary to set out realistic cal@@ ori@@ - and fatty targets . • Do you want to move a dietary supplement with information about the cal@@ ori@@ de and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start to taking alli . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alli program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a food plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed and feed themselves , physically active . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in conjunction with a cut @-@ cut program to support weight loss , you can help you develop a health@@ ier lifestyle and achieve your goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Alo@@ xi is used in chemotherapy ; the severe trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting are ( such as c@@ is@@ pla@@ tin ) and in chemotherapy ; the regular trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting are ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ opla@@ tin ) .
the effectiveness of al@@ xi can be increased by the extra gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug which can be used as an anti @-@ therapeutic agent ) .
the application of patients under the age of 18 is not recommended since there is no enough information to the effects in this age group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the substance prevents the bond of a chemical substance in the body , 5 hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Alo@@ xi has been studied in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received the chemotherapy for nausea and vom@@ iting in three main studies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with chemotherapy , a strong cataly@@ st for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients who were treated with al@@ xi ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared with 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with chemotherapy , the regular trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients who were treated with al@@ xi ( 153 from 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron patients ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when compared with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values are 63 % for al@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission granted Helsin@@ n Bi@@ rex Pharmac@@ euticals Ltd . a approval of the transport of al@@ xi in the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : to prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to a cancer disease and for nausea and vom@@ iting in moderately @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy because of a cancer disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the efficacy of al@@ xi to prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a severely em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be enhanced by adding one of the cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on as@@ say , patients with an@@ am@@ nesty ob@@ tain@@ ation or signs of a sub @-@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection can be monitored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , caution is advisable while offering pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T@@ - interval is extended or that inc@@ lin@@ ation to such an extension . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; except in connection with a further chemotherapy first , Alo@@ xi should neither be used for nausea and vom@@ iting in days after chemotherapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron does not undergo tumor @-@ related activity of the five examined chemotherapy , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ ano@@ ab@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a clinical study no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and one ste@@ ady stat@@ e- Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a population based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis a significant effect of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hibit@@ ors , C@@ im@@ eti@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ o@@ ine , C@@ im@@ eti@@ ine , C@@ im@@ eti@@ ine , C@@ im@@ eti@@ din , k@@ ini@@ din , k@@ go@@ al@@ ine and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experience on applying Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on human gest@@ ures are not found , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used by pregnant women , unless it is considered to be considered necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials the most frequent in a dose of 250 micro@@ gram has been observed ( altogether 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least possibly by Alo@@ xi ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions by appointment ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the group with the highest dosage , similar things showed themselves of adverse events such as in other do@@ zing groups , there were no dose of active relationships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were performed , due to the large distribution volume , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy for al@@ op@@ ia over@@ dos@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , 1,@@ 132 mg / m2 fa@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 dos@@ as@@ et@@ ron received , with patients compared to 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.3 hours ) , which was given on day 1 without exam@@ in@@ eth@@ ason intraven@@ ously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ c@@ is@@ pla@@ tin were obtained , with patients compared to 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given at day 1 intraven@@ ously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
results of studies with moderately @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials for indicator @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were comparable to the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and E@@ KG parameters including the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron possesses the ability to block the ion channels in vent@@ ri@@ cular De@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation to extend the duration of the action potential . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the study of the study conducted at 221 healthy volunteers conducted the evaluation of the E@@ KG effects of I.@@ V. i@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in individual doses of 0,@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after intraven@@ ous gift , resign@@ ation follows a slow elim@@ ination of the body with an average termin@@ ological half @-@ time of about 40 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally proportional to the total dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in case of bi@@ ds and cancer patients .
after intraven@@ ous gift of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses occurred with 11 ± 34 % increase in pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simu@@ lations , that occurred at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron at 3 consecutive days , the C@@ max was above 0.@@ 75 mg higher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys , and roughly 50 % are being transformed into two primary metabol@@ ites in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recep@@ tor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in @-@ vitro studies on the metabolism have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and , in any lower extent , the I@@ so@@ onis CY@@ P3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
elim@@ ination After a intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in urine was found as un@@ altered active substance made about 40 % of the given dose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a unique intraven@@ ous inj@@ ections , the total body @-@ type 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearing was 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although patients with severe liver function increases the termin@@ ale elim@@ ination @-@ time and the average system@@ ic exposure with pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , but reducing the dose is not justified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered sufficiently above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a low relevance for clinical use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 10 out of clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , who are involved in vent@@ ri@@ cular De@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation , which can extend the duration of action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose spoke in about 30@@ times of therapeutic exposure to humans ) that led to a increased frequency of liver tum@@ ors , end@@ oc@@ r@@ ine Ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , pit@@ u@@ er@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ors on rats , but not in mice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but due to the high dos@@ ages and because Alo@@ xi is intended for the unique application , the relevance of these results will be very low . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June 2006 , the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report for the treatment of hepatitis C prescribed medicines intended for the treatment of hepatitis C 6 million IE / ml injection solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that Alph@@ eon should re@@ semble a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same chem@@ ically effective ingredient that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference drug &quot; ) .
Alph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a fatal liver disease ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a micro@@ scop@@ ic examination the liver damage indicates , the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine Amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is produced by a yeast which has been introduced into a gene ( DNA ) , which contributes to the formation of active substance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the manufacturer of Alph@@ eon presented data , which prove the comparison of Alph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , composition , purity of the drug , mode of mode , safety and efficacy of hepatitis C ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study of patients with hepatitis C , the Alph@@ eon effectiveness was compared with the efficacy of reference to 4@@ 55 patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study , as many patients were treated after 12 of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after setting of treatment to the medication ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , concerns were wor@@ ned , that the data is not sufficient for the stability of active substance and marketing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the number of patients with hepatitis C , which spoke on the treatment with Alph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after setting the treatment with Alph@@ eon , the disease in more patients ret@@ ard@@ ant at more than with the reference department ; Alph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from that , the study included an immune response in the study ( i.e. the body forms anti@@ bodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , not adequ@@ ately vali@@ dated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it can be used for the treatment of Im@@ mer@@ go ( one with cru@@ sten@@ tions of her@@ edi@@ tary skin infection ) and small infected by @-@ infected wounds ( cra@@ ck or liqu@@ or ) wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections which have been verified or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ e@@ resist@@ ed Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ coc@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go against this kind of infections may not be eff@@ ected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be used for patients from the age of nine months , but patients under the age of 18 may not be more than 2 % of the body surface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the patient does not apply to treatment two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments in consideration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial giant ( the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main indicator of the effectiveness was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was decreased after the end of the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under plac@@ ebo spoke to the treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the treatment of infected dogs , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in demonstrated similar rates : if the results of both studies were joined together at Hau@@ tw@@ unden , some 90 % of the patients were treated to treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these two studies , however , that Al@@ tar@@ go has been caused by the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( eit@@ er@@ filled ca@@ vi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections which were demon@@ stra@@ bly or probably caused by MR@@ SA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irritation of the Principal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go abo@@ unds in the following surface treatment against the risks : • Im@@ peti@@ go , infected small in@@ fir@@ s , depreci@@ ations or se@@ wn wounds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission approved the G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . a permit for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients with which have no improvement within two to three days , should be investigated again and considered an alternative therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of a sensi@@ ti@@ zing or severe local irritation by the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be the treatment is ab@@ orted , the o@@ int@@ ment must be carefully removed and an appropriate alternative treatment of infection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections , to which MR@@ SA is known as a patho@@ gen or susp@@ ects ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical studies of secondary wounds the effectiveness of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at patients with infections , caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ coc@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternative therapy is to be considered when after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment , no improvement or deteri@@ oration of infected place occurs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the impact of the simultaneous application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means of the same skin area is not investigated , and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to low plasma concentrations , which have been achieved in humans after top@@ ical applied skin or infected superf@@ icial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo can not be expected ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 As for simultaneous treatment of 2 times daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the medium ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be increased to reduced skin of healthy adult men by 81 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the low system@@ ic exposure after top@@ ical application , dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tations are not required if top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin are applied during a system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P3@@ A4 In@@ hibit@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; animal studies have shown a reproduction of reproduction after oral surgery , in@@ adequate regarding a statement regarding the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should be applied during pregnancy when a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clear and the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin to present the gift of an system@@ ic antibiot@@ ic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the breast@@ feeding continued , the breast@@ feeding continued , or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continues to stop , is between the benefit of lac@@ tation for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with superf@@ icial skin infections that Al@@ tar@@ go were the most frequently reported side effects , which was about 1 % of the patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ vatives of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is used by fermentation from c@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ anus ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect mechanism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction in a certain ties of the 50s of the bacterial giant , which differs from the binding of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ ag@@ ger@@ ating anti@@ bacterial substances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
data point out that the bonds of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P bonds and Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ral centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through bon@@ ding to this engagement level , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bit P @-@ binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50s mos@@ bos@@ om sub@@ units . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance , the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infectious forms should be concei@@ vable , should be targeted by experts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were no differences in in @-@ vitro activity from ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the ins@@ ulates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of failure to treat S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ ine was brought daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , which received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ ine twice daily for 5 days for top@@ ical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plas@@ map@@ ro@@ ben have been won . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sampling occurred on days 3 or 4 in adult patients each before the medication and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however the maximum individual system@@ ic intake of humans after top@@ ical application of 1 % of o@@ int@@ ment is reduced to 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g ( h / ml ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g ( h / ml ) .
metabolic metabolism in vitro oxid@@ ant metabolism in human liver micro@@ som@@ en was primarily medi@@ ated by CY@@ P C@@ 8 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in studies of oral tox@@ icity on rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) which were performed over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the approval of the approval process is to ensure that a pharmaceutical co@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system is present , as in the 1.@@ 8.1 system of the application form , and will work before the product is marketed as long as the marketed product will be marketed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the approval of approval for the supervisory board is required to implement detailed studies and additional pharmaceutical @-@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan , as well as all additional updates of the R@@ MP , as well as all additional updates of the R@@ MP , which will be agreed with CH@@ MP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; irritation or other signs and symptoms show in the treated place , you should finish the use of al@@ tar@@ go and talk to your doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not apply other salads , cre@@ ams or l@@ otions on the surface which is treated with Al@@ tar@@ go if it has not been prescribed by your doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may not be applied in the eyes , mouth or on the lips , in the nose or female genital area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the o@@ int@@ ment is visible on one of these surfaces , wash the spot with water and ask your doctor to help advice if complaints occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after carrying the o@@ int@@ ment you can cover the affected area with a ster@@ ile association or a Gaz@@ ever@@ band , unless your doctor has advised you to cover the surface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is offered in aluminium tube with plastic closure , containing 5 , 10 or 15 grams of o@@ int@@ ment , or in an aluminum bag that contains 0,5 g of o@@ int@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis C and hepatitis B ( diseases which concern the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 , which are not immune to these two diseases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix is applied to an existing vacc@@ ination within two doses , whereby an protection against hepatitis B may be achieved only after administration of the second dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix is only allowed to be used while immun@@ isation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and ensured that the two doses can be led to an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a search@@ able dose against hepatitis A or B is desired , Ambi@@ rix can be used or another Hepatitis B or B vaccine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
vacc@@ ines influence the immune defence ( the natural defense of the body ) and bring it against a disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and creates anti@@ bodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the vaccine approved since 1996 , and the Twin@@ rix children have been approved since 1997 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered at the existing vacc@@ ination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data which are used by Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults are also used as receipt for the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children , which had developed a month after the last injection a protective anti@@ viral concentrations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an additional study with 208 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with six months and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two inj@@ ections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ambient conditions resulted in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection of the antibody concentration of hepatitis A and B .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the additional study showed that the degree of protection from Ambi@@ rix was similar in a six @-@ month period between the inj@@ ections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( seen at more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are head@@ ache , loss of appetite , pain , redness , mat@@ ur@@ eness , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix is allowed to react in patients suffering from any other components or Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) , which may not be applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; August 2002 , the European Commission granted the G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals . a permit for the creation of Ambi@@ rix in the entire region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the standardi@@ zation plan for the pri@@ di@@ mm@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is given on the date of choice and the second dose administered after the first dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a search@@ able vacc@@ ination is desired for hepatitis B and hepatitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ents vacc@@ ines or with a combination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the anti @-@ hepatitis C virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ V ) antibody , anti @-@ hepatitis C virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibody , anti @-@ hepatitis C virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ents vacc@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not yet fully secured , whether immun@@ o @-@ A@@ - vaccine is addressed to a risk of hepatitis as protection , since they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 As for all injection of inj@@ ections , the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ tic reaction after the gift of the vaccine should always be available for medical treatment and monitoring . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an faster protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended to contain 360 ELISA units of in@@ activated hepatitis C virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able hepatitis B surface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of hem@@ ost@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , in@@ adequate anti @-@ HAV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS anti@@ bodies is not achieved so that in these cases the gift of other vacc@@ ines may be required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intra@@ muscular administration in the body muscle could lead to an optimal imp@@ acted , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , at Th@@ ro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ t@@ open@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , ambi@@ tions can be inj@@ ected in@@ sub@@ cut@@ aneous sub@@ cut@@ aneous , since it can occur in these cases after intra@@ muscular administration to bleeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of a separate injection at the same time with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ tis , tet@@ ra and hair @-@ cell@@ ul@@ ae type b vaccine ( DT@@ Pa @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined mas@@ the@@ - m@@ umps @-@ R@@ öt@@ tle vaccine is enough ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients under immune pressure therapy or patients with immune defects must be assumed , that possibly no adequate immune response is achieved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , gast@@ ro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever comparable to the frequency that has been observed in previous Thi@@ omer@@ ically and preser@@ vative @-@ containing vacc@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were administered at a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 and including 15 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study with 300 participants from 12 to 15 years , the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ doses of combination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat at a calculation base per vaccine dose of Ambi@@ rix , but not at a calculation base per person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of the subjects compared with 3@@ 9.1 % in the subjects according to the gift of a 3 @-@ doses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the complete vacc@@ in@@ cycle , 6@@ 6.4 % of subjects which were administered by the ambi@@ tions were reported over pain , versus 6@@ 3,8 % among the subjects which were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the frequency of mat@@ uring was comparable per pro@@ band ( i.e. through the entire vacc@@ in@@ cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects that were obtained with 3@@ 6.2 % compared with 3@@ 6.2 % in combination with the 3 doses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pre@@ valence of pain and mat was low and comparable , which was observed by the 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ines after administration of the combination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a compar@@ ative study of 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the appearance of loc@@ al@@ re@@ interactions and general interactions were comparable with the 3 @-@ doses @-@ un@@ activated hepatitis C virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , with the 6@@ - to 11@@ - year old , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a little occurrence of pain ( at the injection center ) per dose , was not reported per pro@@ band . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the share of vacc@@ ines , which reported over severe side effects during the 2 doses of vaccine doses with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units , in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis C virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B@@ - surface coating , was statisti@@ cally different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials which were carried out at vacc@@ ines during the age of 1 and including 15 years after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , the month 6 ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ser@@ o@@ conver@@ gence for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7 In a compar@@ ative study , which was performed in 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were obtained with three doses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the 289 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ icity was proved , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B was significantly higher in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3 @-@ dose result . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immun@@ o@@ answers that were reached in a clinical trial study at 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after the completion of the full vacc@@ ines ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both studies , the vacc@@ inations received either a 2 @-@ doses @-@ vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA units , in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis C virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for individuals who were aged between 12 and 15 years old the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ HAV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS anti@@ bodies were detected within 24 months after immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immune response against both anti@@ gens was comparable to the vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination of 360 ELISA units and in@@ in@@ activated h@@ ep@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface coating in a dose of 0.5 ml .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical study at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year olds , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ HAV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS anti@@ bodies were comparable to immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ination scheme . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the first dose of ambient is administered at the beginning of the second year with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ tis of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ tis , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ itis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influenza vacc@@ ines ( DT@@ Pa @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les type b @-@ m@@ umps for vacc@@ ination was sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults , showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ective and ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions as for the former formulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vaccine is applied both before and after the resign@@ ation by eye on any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hepatitis C virus is usually transmitted by vir@@ us@@ el@@ ous food and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as swimming in water @-@ contaminated waters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , an infl@@ atable face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that possibly make a stationary treatment necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , ambi@@ tions can not fully protect against hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus infection , even if the complete vacc@@ ines have been completed with 2 doses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you are infected with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus before administration of both vacc@@ ination or hepatitis B virus ( although you feel / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill ) it may not prevent a vacc@@ ination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a protection against other infections that may harm the liver or symptoms that are similar to hepatitis C or hepatitis B infection , can not be communicated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • if you have an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix , or any component of this vaccine including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an allergic reaction may appear due to it@@ ulating skin erup@@ tions , respiratory or swelling of the face or the tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you have a serious infection with fever .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • If you want to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. , within 6 months and prior to the second vaccine dose ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination by ambi@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead he will recommend to you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis C / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of active hepatitis C virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface coating .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second vacc@@ ines of this vacc@@ ination with reduced content of effective components is usually administered one month after the first dose , and should give you a vacc@@ ination before completion of the vacc@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes ambi@@ tions will suffer with people suffering from severe bleeding disorders , when you are weak@@ ened to the skin and not into the muscle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these persons on vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient , so as a blood test can be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 21 Say you to your doctor if you have taken further drugs , or if you have been vacc@@ inated in your child or if you have been in@@ sof@@ ten@@ ed / has been given to your child or have planned it in the near future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it may be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient , therefore the person is not protected against either one or both hepatitis A and B virus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if another vacc@@ ines have to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , separate spots and limbs should be vacc@@ inated as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if ambi@@ tions should be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ inen , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will be sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually ambi@@ tions will not be administered pregnant or lac@@ t@@ ating women , unless it is urgent need to be vacc@@ inated both against hepatitis A and hepatitis B . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiot@@ ic ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and make an appointment as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of data , which have been known since issu@@ ance of the first permission for the transport system , the CH@@ MP noted that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for ambi@@ tions remains positive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , since ambi@@ tions were only brought into a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine was limited due to the low patient exposure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ammon@@ es@@ eed may also be used in patients at the age of over a month with in@@ complete enzyme or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ium cep@@ hal@@ opathy ( brain @-@ compensation due to high ammon@@ i@@ per@@ cep@@ tions ) in history .
ammon@@ es@@ eed is divided - split by several individual doses to the meals - at the same time a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ g ( through the abdominal wall in the stomach @-@ leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( due to the nose in the stomach @-@ leading tube ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a compar@@ ative study , since ammon@@ aps could not be compared with another treatment or plac@@ ebo ( e.g. no active substance ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ammon@@ i@@ liqu@@ or may also result of loss of appetite , a abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin rash , uncomfortable body odor , or weight gain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end , the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that ammon@@ es@@ eed is effectively prevented in patients with mal@@ functions of the ur@@ inary cycle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ammon@@ aps has been approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the sel@@ en@@ ity of the condition at the time of admission only limited information on this medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use is indi@@ an in all patients , with which a complete en@@ lack of enzyme already mani@@ f@@ ests in the new@@ born term ( within the first 28 days of life ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with a late enzyme ( in@@ complete enzyme is manifest@@ ed after the first time of life ) , an indication of hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy is made possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for babies , for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with gor@@ ges@@ tion , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ule form . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the daily dose is individually taken into consideration of protein toler@@ ances , growth and development of daily protein intake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ h : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg and for adults and adults .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients who suffer from an early manifest deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ates , sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dose of 0,@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with an Arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ uc@@ cin@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase lack need arg@@ in@@ ine in a dose of 0,4 g / kg / day or 8,8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be taken with in@@ ges@@ tion , as there is a risk for the emergence of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us if the tablets are unable to enter into the stomach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure , as well as with sodium re@@ tention and o@@ de@@ mb@@ op@@ ting incoming clinical conditions only with caution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is carried out over the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the significance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at sub@@ cut@@ aneous preparation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ at to young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ down of neur@@ ons and increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a delayed appeal of cer@@ eb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functional nerve damage in the brain , and therefore a disability of brain growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could not be noticed if phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ at is ex@@ cre@@ ted into breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during the breast@@ feeding is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS in 56 % of patients at least an unwanted event ( AE ) and 78 % of those unwanted events was assumed that they were not connected with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a metabolic du@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ tic acid , p@@ anc@@ yt@@ open@@ ia , periph@@ eral Neu@@ rop@@ athy , and pancre@@ atitis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a case of over@@ dos@@ ing occurred in a 5 months old to@@ dd@@ ler with an acci@@ dental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these symptoms occur with accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ at , which showed a dos@@ is@@ limit@@ ing neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity with an intraven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ at is a metabolic active compound associated with acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to urea ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore ideally suited as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of surplus nitrogen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
5 patients with mal@@ functions of the urea @-@ cycle may be assumed that for each gram ei@@ ves sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is of significance that the diagnosis is made early on and the treatment is immediate , in order to improve the chances of survival and the clinical outcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the progn@@ osis of the early manifest form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in the new@@ born child was earlier almost always inf@@ ring@@ ing , and the disease carried out in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their sti@@ cking @-@ free analy@@ ser within the first half of life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by hem@@ ost@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , proteins and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of the patient at post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first lifetime ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients whose illness was diagnosed during pregnancy and the survival of hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy was diagnosed already before the first appearance of a hyper@@ ammon@@ ium En@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy , but the survival compared with many too intellectual disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its was diagnosed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in patients with a late patients suffering from the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ist bam@@ y@@ las@@ e @-@ deficiency ) which were treated with sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a prot@@ ein@@ ated diet that was treated 98 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly reversible and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical status can occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ al is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in the liver and kidneys with glut@@ amine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were obtained after gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ sal@@ y@@ rat , and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis after individual entry and repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in cancer patients , the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabolism was also studied after intraven@@ ous injection of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after an oral component of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablet form , 15 minutes after taking measur@@ able plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat have been noted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the majority of patients with urea @-@ cycli@@ c disorders , or hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ies were demon@@ stra@@ ble after different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ al ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) in the next morning after ni@@ ghtly fasting and no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the medium @-@ level phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is dischar@@ ged within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of con@@ ju@@ gated product Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine over the kidneys .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat have been treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is either or@@ ally taken ( babies and children who have not swal@@ lowed any tablets or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ i or a nas@@ al probe .
according to previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg and for adults and adults .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins should be kept within the normal area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients who suffer from an early manifest deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ates , sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dose of 0,@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when rats were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ at ( active Met@@ abo@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , it came to l@@ esi@@ ons in the py@@ rami@@ ds of the c@@ ort@@ ex . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a metabolic du@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ tic acid , p@@ anc@@ yt@@ open@@ ia , periph@@ eral Neu@@ rop@@ athy , and pancre@@ atitis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to urea ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of surplus value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the basis of investigations about the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the urea @-@ cycle can be assumed that for each gram ei@@ ves sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical status can occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after an oral component of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form , 15 minutes after taking measur@@ able plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat have been noted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the duration of durability , the patient may store the finished product once a period of 3 months at a temperature of no more than 25 ° C. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this case the small measuring spoon is 0.@@ 95 g for the medium measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
if a patient must obtain the medicine above a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with these rare ill@@ nesses , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they accum@@ ulate in the body from protein in the body , not ex@@ crete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if lab examinations are made , you must notify the doctor that you can take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat may affect the results of certain laboratory investigations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or recently taken , even if it is not prescri@@ ption drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the breast@@ feeding time , you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because the drug may damage the breast milk and damage your baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 31 • Take off a measuring spoon of gran@@ ulate , for example , remove a straight edge , e.g. a measuring spoon with a measuring spoon . • Use the recommended number of measuring spoon gran@@ ulate from the container . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
angi@@ ox is used for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syndrome ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) or for instance with unstable anxiety ( a form of pain in breast cancer with different starch ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( cardi@@ ography ) or electro@@ cardi@@ ac inf@@ ar@@ ction ( electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or E@@ KG ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if An@@ gi@@ ox is applied to preventing blood cl@@ ots in patients , which is administered to a PCI and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of patients suffering from ang@@ ina or heart attack , this can contribute to the maintenance of blood flow to heart and increase effectiveness of a PCI . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approximately 14 000 patients attended the main study on the treatment of ACS , where the effect of angi@@ ox or II@@ IA inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with common combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a GP@@ I was compared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the PCI the patient was frequently used a st@@ ent ( a short tube , which remains in the lot@@ tery to prevent a lock ) and they received additional medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and asp@@ ir@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without a gift of GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or re@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients who undergo a PCI was An@@ gi@@ ox , with regards to all indicators just as effective as He@@ par@@ in , except for heavy blood vessels , with which it was much more effective than he@@ par@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
angi@@ ox is not allowed to be used in patients who may be sensitive to bi@@ valent ( allergic ) against bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , other mil@@ ud@@ ine or other components .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , it must not be applied in patients who recently had a hem@@ orr@@ ha@@ ge , as well as in people with heavy hypertension or severe kidney problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval of the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd , an approval of the establishment of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile ang@@ ina / failure - ST / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) ) in an emergency attack or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a PCI is performed in another sequence , an additional Bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be increased and in@@ fusion should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the PCI , according to clinical requirements the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately prior to the procedure , a resolution of 0.5 mg / kg should be given , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initi@@ als intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight and an immediate subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety and effectiveness of a sole Bol@@ us gift of angi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended , even if a short PCI procedure is planned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this value is shortened ( ACT after 5 minutes ) to 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight should be reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ conven@@ ed and diluted medicine should be carefully mixed before application and given to the bol@@ us dose intraven@@ ously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is given correctly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of patients with moderate ren@@ al reduction of kidney disease ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) which is subjected to a PCI ( whether suffering from Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) should be used as a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the ACT @-@ value is under 225 seconds , a second bol@@ us dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be fed and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bol@@ us dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of patients with moderate kidney damage caused in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( replace 2 @-@ 2 ) which was included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI trial without dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tion at an average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis , An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the completion of the administered intraven@@ ous he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular he@@ par@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or other components or against bra@@ ud@@ ine bleeding due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of hem@@ ost@@ atic disorders and / or ir@@ reversible cer@@ eb@@ ral disorders , • heavier kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis prob@@ able patients &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients are me@@ ticul@@ ous in treating symptoms and signs of blood , especially if bi@@ valent in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans is given ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if in case of PCI @-@ patients suffering from Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , most bleeding in arter@@ ial points can occur in patients suffering from per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ar@@ intervention ( PCI ) , during treatment in principle ha@@ em@@ orr@@ ha@@ ges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients who are receiving al@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , a monitoring of IN@@ R Wer@@ ts ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) should ensure that the value after placing the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine is once again achieved before the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; starting from knowledge about the mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or Th@@ ro@@ m@@ bo@@ g@@ ag@@ ga@@ in@@ em@@ mer ) , these substances can increase the risk of blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with Th@@ ro@@ m@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ag@@ gre@@ ga@@ tional mines or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ ase@@ parameters are regularly monitored in any case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the experimental studies are in@@ adequate for the effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ized to either GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA inhibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ised to either in@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA inhibit@@ or .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine Group as well as in patients with He@@ par@@ in treated cases , women and patients over 65 years were more common to adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
heavy bleeding were defined after AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i scale bars for heavy bleeding as in table 2 in the foot@@ notes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both light and severe bleeding were significantly lower than in the groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA inhibit@@ or , plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an AC@@ U@@ ITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or bleeding in the point of point that implant@@ ation of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror with a diameter of ≥ 5 g / dl with a well @-@ known hem@@ orr@@ ha@@ yst@@ ation of ≥ 5 g / dl with a known hem@@ orr@@ ha@@ vent or effect of blood products to trans@@ fusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further , less frequently observed hem@@ orr@@ ha@@ ges that came up with more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; Other &quot; points , Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following data of side effects are based on data from a clinical study using Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine in 6,000 patients who undergo a PCI . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine Group as well as in patients with He@@ par@@ in treated cases , women and patients over 65 years were more common to adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both light and severe bleeding were significantly less frequent compared to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in compared to He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA inhibit@@ or .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported following comprehensive application in practice , and are classified according to system organ@@ classes in Table 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of over@@ dos@@ ing , treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine is down@@ right to break and the patient with regard to sign of bleeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , a direct and specific Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in@@ for@@ or , which bin@@ ds both on the cataly@@ tic centre as well as at the animal matern@@ ity region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or at the cl@@ ause . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bond of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine at Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and with it its effect , is reversible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generates the bond of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine @-@ Arg@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thereby reducing the function of the active centre of thro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine induced thro@@ mb@@ osis / he@@ par@@ in@@ surg@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induc@@ ing thro@@ mb@@ osis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) had come to in@@ duce thro@@ mb@@ osis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in healthy volunteers and in patients , Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine shows anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is occupied by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if in the patient a PCI was performed below , an additional Bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine should be increased and the in@@ fusion should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the arms A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study was administered in@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in according to the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with unstable anxiety ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to either obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA inhibit@@ or either before the angi@@ ography ( at the time of mar@@ om@@ ization ) or in the PCI .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the AC@@ U@@ ITY study showed the characteristics of high @-@ risk experiments , which required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , evenly distributed over the 3 treatment arms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about 77 % of patients had a recur@@ ring isch@@ emia of 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - Chang@@ es or enhanced car@@ di@@ als biom@@ ar@@ ker , 28 % were subjected to diabetes and about 99 % of patients under@@ gone a angi@@ ography within 72 hours .

* Clo@@ pi@@ dog@@ rel against angi@@ ography or front of PCI 1 A AC@@ U@@ ITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ per@@ ito @-@ Ne@@ ale , intra@@ ocular bleeding or bleeding in the point of point , reduction by hem@@ ost@@ o @-@ bell mirror with a blood pressure or surgery due to a bleeding , use of blood products to trans@@ fusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 30 @-@ day results , based on four @-@ triple and triple @-@ score points of a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study with more than 6,000 patients under@@ gone a PCI ( replace @-@ 2 ) , are shown in Table 10 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the use of angi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of bi@@ valent in patients were evaluated using a per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with ACS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected that Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in as Pep@@ tide is a cat@@ abolic components , followed by subsequent recovery of amino acids in the body pool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the primary met@@ abo@@ ite that results from the division of the Arg@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 @-@ To @-@ termin@@ al sequence by thro@@ mb@@ in is not effective because of the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic centre of thro@@ mb@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elim@@ ination occurs in patients with normal kidney function , after a process first order with a termin@@ al half @-@ time of 25 ± 12 minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on conventional studies on Safety Pharmac@@ ology , Tox@@ icity at repe@@ ating gift , Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity or Re@@ productive data , the pre@@ ventive data do not recognize any particular dangers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tox@@ icity in animals with repeated or continuous exposure ( 1 day to 4 weeks in a exposure to the 10 @-@ fa@@ xes of the clinical Ste@@ ady state plasma concentration ) limited pharmac@@ ological effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; side effects due to long @-@ term physi@@ ological burden as a reaction to a non @-@ home@@ ost@@ atic co@@ ag@@ ulation were similar to those in clinical application , even at a very much higher dosage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the production of the ready @-@ to @-@ use solution is not performed under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions , it is no longer available 24 hours at 2 ° C up to 8 ° C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
An@@ gi@@ ox is a weigh@@ ted powder in single dose of water in single dose of 10 ml ; sealed with a but@@ yl rubber blades and sealed to a cap made of pressed aluminium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 5 ml of the water for inj@@ ections are given in a c@@ ylind@@ rical bottle An@@ gi@@ ox , which everything is fully dissolved and the solution is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
5 ml will be taken from the water bottle and diluted with 5 % glucose solutions for injection or with 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chloride solution for injection in a total volume of 50 ml to obtain a concentration of 5@@ mg / ml bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used for the treatment of adults , adolescents and children over six years with diabetes , which require treatment with insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh@@ s or upper arm inj@@ ected or in@@ fusion with a insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level ( sugar ) or the insulin is not effective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very slightly for human@@ kind , and the change means that it has an faster effect and a shorter active life has a short @-@ effective human@@ kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in the application in combination with type 1 diabetes in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body does not produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and a study of 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in type 2 diabetes , with the body insulin , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main indicator for efficacy was the change of concentration of the substance gly@@ co@@ ag@@ ulated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which shows how good blood sugar is adjusted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( 7,@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) in comparison to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % was found in insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0,@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra , compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is not allowed to be used in patients who are perhaps over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who already suffer from a hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra must be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other drugs , which can impact on blood glucose levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Germany GmbH granted approval for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra is either used as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the field of abdominal wall which can apply or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous in@@ fusion in the area of abdominal wall C@@ KE .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the reduced glucose level capacity and the dimin@@ ished insulin metabolism , the insulin requirement can be reduced in patients with a reduction of liver function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any changes to the action strength , the brand ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the type of insulin ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc del@@ a@@ sible , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the production method can draw a change of the insulin demand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 . an in@@ adequate dose or treatment of treatment , especially in patients with ins@@ ulated diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia and a di@@ abe@@ tic converter ; these conditions are potentially life threatening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of a patient to another insulin type or a insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision , and can make a change in dosage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the timing of a hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia depends on the drug profile of the used insulin , and can therefore change the treatment schem@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to strengthen the substances that can increase blood sugar levels and inc@@ lin@@ ation to hypo@@ gly@@ phs , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ Con@@ ver@@ ting @-@ enzyme , Mon@@ o@@ amine , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ cycl@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ cycl@@ ine and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , among the effects of sympath@@ ies such as beta block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ id@@ in , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ in , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ in , and reserves the symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ er@@ gen counter@@ regulation could be weak@@ ened or absent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and Human@@ ity regarding the pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not known whether insulin over@@ comes into human breast milk , but in general insulin is not absorbed into the breast milk , nor is it absorbed to oral application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; below , the results of clinical trials are listed below : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; frequently : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 100 ; very rare ( Frequ@@ ency on the basis of their ba@@ ak@@ - data not in@@ valuable ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cold cold welding , bold and soft skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ ach , anxiety , unusual fatigue , lack of concentration , lack of concentration , nausea , and heart@@ beat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y is failed to continuously change the injection of injection within the injection area , and can occur in a result of a li@@ yst@@ roph@@ y at the injection station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic bodies with difficulty @-@ less@@ ness can be given by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) which is given by an intra@@ muscular relief of glucose by a doctor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a gluten development , the patient should be supervised in a hospital to identify the urine cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimul@@ ating the periph@@ eral glucose levels ( especially through skel@@ eton muscles and fat ) and in@@ hibition of glucose levels in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes showed that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ - be of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in efficiency occurs faster and the duration of action is shorter than at hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study of 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes m@@ ul@@ li@@ - T@@ US showed insulin @-@ type damp@@ ed dos@@ ing range from 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg and a proportional increase in the drau@@ ght effect as well as human@@ insulin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as fast action occurs as normal human insulin , and achieve full drau@@ ght effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human@@ kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a similar post@@ p@@ ran@@ al gly@@ cem@@ ic control is achieved as with human normal insulin , which is 30 minutes before the meal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was canc@@ eled insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ al control was given in 2 minutes before the meal was reached . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is used to take insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 15 minutes after the meal begins - a comparable gly@@ cem@@ ic control is given as in human normal insulin that is given 2 Mi@@ - N@@ uts before the meal ( see figure 1 ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - previously ) before the meal was given to human normal insulin the 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the beginning of the meal was given ( figure 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( figure 1B ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in gift for 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - after beginning of the meal compared to human Nor@@ - mal@@ insulin after 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the meal was given ( Figure 1C ) .
