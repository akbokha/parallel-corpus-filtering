&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional features and simpli@@ fy the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making these easier available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
further information on the use of &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions are found in the manual &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings extensions .... open the boxes and select the desired modules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a list with standard inser@@ tion modules from the K@@ DE package ; Ad@@ d@@ ons . please note , you may have more modules installed on your system if you have additional software installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , which contains &amp; Account , before you comp@@ ile this package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; then you can view the site , the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of depos@@ iting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the module calls ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under ex@@ tras . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current work directory in different ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to view the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or , select the display with the DO@@ M of the displayed web page . as a pres@@ etting , the display starts with the DO@@ M of the document . as default , the display starts with the DO@@ M . all other no@@ des are knot@@ ted with this root . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents a further view for objects with the M@@ IM@@ E type I@@ node / directory for local files , so that you can view the content of your local file system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pec@@ uli@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists in size , enclosed folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called tree map . each object is proportional to its size . this size must have the sum of the sizes of an object smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &amp; FS@@ View ; the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is specified as the sum of the size of the entries is determined . consequently , &amp; FS@@ View is able to be recognized as a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; FS@@ View ; this entry is a rect@@ angle , which represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for simpler navigation use the rect@@ angle meaningful colour and inscription settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the colour of a rect@@ angle that is switched above colour mode , can either be a depth for the easy detection of any other file properties like name , owner , group or M@@ IM@@ E type . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the various features of the corresponding file or folder . for each feature , you can specify if there is enough space to display due to the character of the tre@@ em@@ ap . moreover , you can specify the relative position of lab@@ eling in rect@@ angle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during presentation algorithms , the area is generally observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry , and this frame is not always kept . note that less space is lost when the rect@@ angle is square , if the rect@@ angle is square . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as layout of the area of an entry for the sub@@ ordin@@ ated entries is left to be left . here , it is always beneficial to the labels and avoid space loss by frame always adv@@ anta@@ geous . the best methods are lines , columns or recur@@ sive second healing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can indicate the minimal displayed area for an entry on the menu . instead , a room pattern is marked in the surface of the parent entry , to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an or@@ derly entry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets , designed to use K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind for application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as base folder , you will be able to change the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ List and use this on the folder icon . more details can be found in the section records . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you have configured the Base folder , you can set up in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ t your digital camera . after that you should learn how to manage your albums and my sample collection to manage your photos in the albums . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; raw data support : if you use the blank mode of your camera , you may also handle it . support is based on the li@@ @-@ w library . if you want to use if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported blan@@ k@@ cameras in the menu Help Roh@@ k@@ amer@@ a@@ Print . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use Camera body is provided , so that you can connect to your digital camera and support your photos directly from your operating system . of course each medium and every card reader is supported by your operating system , with &amp; digi@@ tised ; working together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern digital cameras are uploaded by using Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for the actual transmission . the camera can also be used as a disk drive . older cameras may use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for digital cameras supporting digital cameras supporting an increasing number of more than 800 cameras supporting a wide @-@ wide protocol created by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of pictures from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need of additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the machine . since photos of the serial port are slow and transm@@ is@@ sions over the serial port are out@@ dated . it supports these cameras and exec@@ utes the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . you will find a complete list of supported cameras this link .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lib@@ ary photo 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support , so that EX@@ IF support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 if the EX@@ IF support can &apos;t be checked out or the generation could be very slow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most beautiful things to &amp; digi@@ ti@@ came ; is , how easy to expand its functionality by modules : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image plug@@ ins Interface Project ( manual ) is a approach to develop a joint modular structure for &amp; digi@@ ti@@ . the aim is to provide the modules for all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it is a user . their advantage is that it is much easier to complement and digi@@ ti@@ zed by writing a small module to complement one function as the changes in &amp; digi@@ tised ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to simpli@@ fy the window you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; removing and removing images everywhere : you can lay a picture in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ ign , via the horizontal cutting line or into another application window . the only restriction is this a picture not available in keywords , file list or searching . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
- a file selection allows you to appro@@ ve the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , T@@ IFF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the text filter is used only for the fields that are displayed in the symbol view . thus , the fil@@ lets will be displayed on the fil@@ en@@ ame . what fields are displayed in the dialog of Al@@ ben@@ Settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; puts an organized view on your photo albums ; all photos that were created by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ff , are sorted by the name of their collection in which the album was first changed . the date can be changed in the properties of the album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have a scanner device , you can also scan a photo directly to an album . you can also add a photo taken directly to an album . select the full screen photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move an image from an album to another or move , you can move the photo with the mouse on the target album and drop it down . simply select all photos and move it onto the target album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an album includes a collection of photos and the album properties allowing you to access the album , click the right mouse button to select the album and select the album button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alb@@ any colle@@ cts : are a method to select your albums , so that you can select or delete albums from your collection . if you want to add or delete records from this collection , you can create this in the settings for collections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the album date : will , if you sort your albums by date with view albums , sort by date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the buttons elder , average , latest : this place the date on the one of the oldest picture or the average of the album . if this fails , the date of the last changes of each file will be used in this folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you first appeared an album in &amp; Bs first , the first picture will be chosen as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first photo on the album . sometimes , the first photo of the album is not representative and you want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to select a different photo as an album icon , you need to select the picture with the right mouse button and in the pop@@ up menu &amp; quot ; then you can select the photo on the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be narrow@@ ed .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ came ; supports the entry of keywords in the field . album collections are always part of the main window . record collections always include all the photos of the album . of course you can use both methods to organize your photos .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture window provides you the main view of your photos . when you select an album , all pictures will be displayed in this album in the image window . each photo is able to adjust the size of this preview with the two Lup@@ in tool@@ bars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you open an album the first time you need to wait , while the preview images can be generated . you can avoid that in which you can create ex@@ tras available all preview images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; information on each image are shown below the associated preview , which information are available , you can change the albums page and adjust the page screen@@ shots to your wishes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the screen@@ shots have a help window that can be taken at a moment via an image . the help shows the most important features including all the tags of a photo . the screenshot shows the main window in the main window shows one such help window .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photos are everything that comes to &amp; digi@@ ti@@ t . albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures , which are possible to give you pictures of the pictures , the preview or the menu on the menu bar . they can choose between the viewer &apos;s views , slide or editing images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can open the image processing with a photo by clicking on the right mouse button , or select the Edit menu with the right mouse button . image processing can be done as you can edit your photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can happen that &amp; digi@@ tised ; the functionality that you need is not available . you can open a photo from the sub@@ menu with the right mouse button and how your program will not be checked , you will find information in &amp; K@@ DE ; manual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you should note that after processing with other image processing programs to problems with the image processed in the picture , so some programs do not save this data from the EX@@ IF data and IP@@ TC data such as orientation , aper@@ ture etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; digi@@ came ; introduces two ways to turn off . the easiest way to click on the right mouse button on the preview and Rotation . in the sub@@ menu , you can indicate the degree of rotation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to change the fil@@ en@@ ames of a photos , you can select with the right mouse button on the preview and F2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you have the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc . ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you get a photo from &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zer , it will be moved in the tr@@ ash@@ bin from &amp; K@@ DE ; will then be moved . F8 picture del@@ etion or Ent@@ f Falls you prefer to delete it , by using Shift ; Ent@@ f . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; view &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ bu@@ quot ; organizes your photos on the data . &amp; digi@@ came ; use either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last change of file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the calendar view , so that only photos of the selected days will be shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photos with keyword provides a flexible and powerful way to organize your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers , the individual photos or groups can be assigned to a photo by selecting this keyword or a search . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if one keyword is selected , all photos that were selected with this keyword are displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Е@@ т@@ и@@ к@@ е@@ т@@ и : you can sort your keywords in a hierarch@@ ical tree . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; keywords are stored in a database for quick access and designated keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you may also import your keywords in other programs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can add new keywords by clicking on the right mouse click on &amp; quot ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you cli@@ cked a new keyword when you cli@@ cked on a existing keyword , this keyword will be used to give you a keyword . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword using the right mouse button and delete it . only the keyword will be removed from this photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can change the position of a keyword by moving it to the desired position in the tree , and then a menu appears to slide you . one keyword can only be in the tree at a time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can change the characteristics of a keyword by clicking on the right mouse button and select the keyword in the context menu keyword ; you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in tree &amp; quot ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you need to select the picture with the right mouse button and select the photo on the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to pass by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ t ; you must first select your photos with keyword . you can drag them on the respective keyword in tree &amp; quot ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also click on the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and select from the text @-@ menu keyword . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can select a photo with any number of words . the photo is displayed on this type , one keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event , where it was made , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you have a photo with keyword , this is displayed under the preview of the picture in the main window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can remove a keyword in which you can open , from the right mouse button and select from the words menu . the menu will show you only the keywords that were assigned to the photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the time beam view shows a tim@@ el@@ able hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved via this hist@@ ogram . in order to display a time@@ frame , you will need to display all related images in the main window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the bottom , you can enter a title and save your selection . it appears in the list below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; embra@@ cing all the elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , j@@ ig@@ s , albums , collections , date stamp and more in the future more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neb@@ end he search@@ box is a small lamp that takes place . if you click here , the filtering is deleted and all the pictures are displayed . if the search is not found , the lamp will be red . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the advanced search tool is hidden in the rider in the left side bar with the bin@@ oc@@ ulars . if you can open it here but as a live search engine that always filters you as a search crit@@ eri@@ on . after being saved it has been stored as a search crit@@ eri@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you &apos;re satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search is performed when you want to change your search list in my search list . if you want to select your selection by clicking my search list and select an option in your context menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select Search , select the search for the search returns once again . if you are looking for extended search , the dialog will appear to search for your previous search . further information can be found in section The tool for Advanced search . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you wish to delete a existing search from the list , select a search in the context menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Advanced search provides an extended search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ pack ; s database . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list of search rules is used to set out the options for a search query in the Alb@@ end@@ aten@@ bank . any option can be deleted or deleted . any option can be added with other via the logical operations All ... , A ... , no ... or Min@@ d ... can be created . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; digi@@ tised ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare it . the lower the difference between two sig@@ li@@ ds , the more they are applied . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar entries : this is a range in which you can drop each image , in order to be enlarged or dimin@@ ished the result list from anywhere on the icon of the invisible search in the left side bar , then you can open it and you can let it fall there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sk@@ etch : free @-@ hand color sk@@ etch : draw a quick sk@@ etch and &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zer ; find the right pictures . also here a swelling can be placed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these riders are made up an intuitive card tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini@@ o . press C@@ tr@@ l ; click C@@ tr@@ l ; click C@@ tr@@ l ; click C@@ tr@@ l . turn out all the pictures within this co @-@ ordin@@ ates and displayed . this is , of course , which contain your pictures Ge@@ o data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the bottom , you can specify a name for your Ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for a later use of the list below . it works like a live Geo@@ ord@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; digi@@ tised ; provides a light screen available in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files , together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
select one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L The light@@ table add from the Con@@ text menu . the selection will be added to the light@@ table and open its window . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ t the main window will open the ligh@@ test with L Extras .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the front bar you can drag the images that you want to compare , in the left or right area of the window and where you can preview them out of the tool@@ bar . you can also compare them to the different picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another mode is better to use in order to navigate quickly out of a picture series , then use the left mouse button in order to display it in the left hand side . this can be done in the right area . this simpli@@ fies a number of similar pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , normal sol@@ dering tasks are also working directly from the light screen like F@@ 4 File Edit .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all image information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both aspects of light , making it easy to link differences with exposure data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ v@@ elling feature which you &apos;ll watch to the crossed arrows . in order to preview the visible area of the picture , both images must be previ@@ ew@@ ed in the same mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; zoom works just as in other views . simply use the zoom kno@@ b among the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse cycle around in the image and zoom . this happens in both images , if you are previ@@ ew@@ ed in mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is a digital ass@@ ess@@ ments - away from the fashion word ? digital inventory management considers any part of the process , sc@@ anned or digital photos records a form of digital ass@@ ess@@ ments . but most of us do not make this form in a systematic and efficient way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how to use your pictures to secure , assess , evaluate , evaluate , evaluate , evaluate , optimize , optimize , and export your image files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; quot ; Digital audit administration is based on an inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , activ@@ ates , transformed , con@@ vers@@ ed , and exports the contents of a mon@@ et@@ ric or cultural value . quot ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
metadata is defined as data on data . metadata is defined according to your definition data that will provide information on or documentation of other data provided by an application or environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I dare to say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you do not need to save many photos you need in a database and a secure archi@@ ving that you can access to other programs , platforms and formats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first thing you can do and know what to fit into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to data structure . you must decide if you want to save them on a reserved drive , or put them on a network drive &amp; etc . you will need to switch them on a bigger drive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps you &apos;ll be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly on your location . if you are using enough pictures in one year . then you will be able to print sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; professional photographers have other requirements like ver@@ sion@@ ing photos , archi@@ ving , work processes , constant supply of images on different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % will not re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types make batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies the backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also recommend the option to save metadata in the setup page of metadata in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ . this ensures that EX@@ IF data and IP@@ TC data can be saved in the file , then you can select the metadata from the database to select the corresponding item in the menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change ? to make them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the real work starts , as you can now select any picture words , let@@ tering and an evaluation . of course , you can select all the pictures you need to choose the same attribute . this makes sense when you can concentrate on the best photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s start with keywords , keywords , such as you are frequently called in other programs , or continue categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you import catal@@ og@@ ised images from another source with embedded j@@ ig@@ s , then &amp; digi@@ ti@@ fies the images to the correct place . the sort of tree changes to another one . the changed keyword will be done by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the graphic shows how different metadata is over@@ laid . this is a very rough representation , as each block of metadata is made from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data of all images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enough the keyword - the next section refers to labels or comments , the third important tool to order your metadata . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t want to miss most of anyone &apos;s photos , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . they &apos;re certainly interested in your photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look at this panorama . out of the distance is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look closer , then start some details to see people , the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and now I am telling you this of the landing place of the Allies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ ot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y . Wow ! you may be able to dream or hear the historical period . so you may even change your perception of this panoramic window .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for others , the title is more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell you a story to help him about the motive that you are moving about what you understand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is okay if a picture is not perfect , if it only work with a label for itself alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sing , you can also use any text in an internation@@ alised alp@@ habet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) as lab@@ eling . you can even publish it for a selection of pictures at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of spatial presentation now already runs with light speed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the possibilities to use ge@@ ol@@ ocation are already am@@ using and can be moved in the future by using some pictures with ge@@ ographic information . also , you can also export your trip to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc . with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and describes the practice to remove the copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ edoms may also apply to all changed versions .
the following description tells you what information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ came ; the information should be deposited at :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the photographer , for example , if it is not wished for the name of the photographer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author ( syn@@ onymous with author line ) : linked to the author . examples of this field contains the name of the photographer . examples for this may be titles as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; publisher ( syn@@ onym for provider ) : use the provider to identify who does not necessarily have the author . if the photograph is provided for a news agency like Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press . if the picture is a bearing photo , then you can see the picture here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important to fill the author and Copyright sections , although these are no more than base knowledge in the work . for individuals , this is only very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ pros this protection is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; will present such a module for batch processing in the near future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; topics : plate errors , disk out@@ age , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of the storage media , rest@@ oring , redund@@ ancy , des@@ aster@@ ance , lifetime , temperature , data size , widespread aber@@ rations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that can happen on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same which can happen to you with traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ roll On@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which caused a loss of data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs these will need to be treated more difficult and you can no longer buy CDs and DVDs in archi@@ val quality . of course you can also get CDs and DVDs in archi@@ val quality . of course you can also claim CDs and DVDs . there is a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . if you believe it is in your gro@@ unding room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be easily readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you can use good dis@@ ks and good recording devices as the cheapest , but you write much more reliable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are very vulnerable to protect your CDs and DVDs . therefore , they use a control mechanism to protect itself . therefore , they use an control sum mechanism to protect itself . despite this massive protection they are needed for form@@ atting and control environments . despite this massive protection they are needed for form@@ atting , ultra@@ violet light , dust &amp; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for defective CDs and DVDs there &apos;s a more convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster , that seems to be done among CDs and DVDs . but there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to save the format war against the HD DVD . a dual player Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB , so it has been said to produce CDs and DVDs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; burn slowly with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in a not ex@@ propri@@ ating format . also , don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disk manufacturers retain their statistics for themselves . your manufacturer guarantees a new disk , but not the data . Google will provide a large field study on the errors of hard disks : flo@@ ppy drive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in brief , Dis@@ ks stay in the temperature range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C . in lower temperature these errors are not able to determine the error . some of the SM@@ ART limits are the most common error correction . these are particularly readers and stor@@ yt@@ ellers . most expected life time span amounts between 4 and 5 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only about the total loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses usually can be produced without great problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while most electric devices do not make up much power , this can cause serious damage in devices with computer chips and high speed control . thus , these an@@ om@@ ali@@ es can cause heavy damage , destro@@ ying mother@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from the avoid@@ able process of loss of time and money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most widespread protection against rapi@@ ds is a over@@ voltage protection . this is a tool absor@@ bs and the rest . however , it is normally in a form of a plug @-@ bar . remember that not every plug bar contains an over@@ voltage protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . you should also pay attention to the protection against lighten@@ ing and thus protects the properly connected devices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an over@@ voltage of any cable to your computer can be used , you should also ensure that all periph@@ er@@ als are also connected to your modem . others provide connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the TV card . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have a notebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for not@@ ebooks , and therefore it is also very small and you are also ideal for your modem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while a over@@ voltage guard your system protects you from smaller variations in the power lines , it will not really help you in case of loss of unwanted data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a interrup@@ tible power supply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the protection against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically save battery energy . some models allow you to save your data and keep them off . some models allow you to save the same quality requirements like an over@@ voltage protection . moreover , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
concerns the potential risk that your invoice system is exposed to and compare its safety in order to avoid this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage guard can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 % . this is just a small price difference if you think so you should always think about all cable cars before you go into the holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . using the right configuration you can use it as a backup to your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amounts of data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared to the hard disks , they are very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 in addition , you must send the data via the relatively slow internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the solutions are therefore only suited to a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general securing solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the Photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos , and you will not get your pictures in full resolution online . you get unlimited space for $ 25 per year , which should be checked in reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the data backup , web solutions are very safe . transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and with the large companies . thus they are the aster@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transm@@ is@@ sions are pr@@ one to transmission errors . the file system z@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs provide at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worst of it is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred . all these faul@@ ts have occurred un@@ discovered until you have been damaged in your machine . no one seems to have thought of it . no one seems to be thought about it . no one seems to be thought about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transfer losses , since they produce inter@@ ferences within the data streams . these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if you are not especially affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Z@@ FS from Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems is one of two candidates to be able to handle and highly scalable . it is open source with many patents and is highly scalable to the GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available in English .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ l file system . this is still used in alpha state , it is used the same protective mechanism to use the z@@ fs and is also available for Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
under@@ estimate that ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss during the notebook and 46 % of the job systems . Not@@ ebooks is already the proportion of thi@@ eves 50 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of data loss because of viruses is less widespread than most people think . it is currently limited to Microsoft systems , as for example , Apple users only know very few viruses and under Linux ; no longer has been sigh@@ ted for a long time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source file systems are less pr@@ one to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the common file systems here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent cor@@ rupted data and data loss : incorrect , only the speed of the examination process during a sudden interrup@@ tions . if a file has not been completely saved before the problem came up , it is lost . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft and human mistakes are the main causes of data loss .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sensors from digital cameras are removed 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings of basic physical boundaries . the technology continues to develop a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and pre@@ mise for all kinds of light sensors are far from this limit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ apixel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is rather wor@@ sen@@ ing for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras are a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
today you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so you don &apos;t make any one data loss for data loss . so check your data after a plan and test it before you do something dangerous for your operating system &apos;s exchange of records or size change of hard drives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suppose you take your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , you will have luck if the drive was not connected to the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a disaster proposes locally and destroys a lot . forget airplane accident : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually concern an entire room or house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Des@@ aster@@ ly in@@ forms always means a not local store . bring your back@@ ups to the stairs to the neighboring house , in your office or similar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is another advantage of the physical separation : as above , a common reason for data loss despite f@@ use the panic . if you have a backup that is not available immediately , you can save that one day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete backup : a complete backup of all files that should be secured . it is a snap@@ shot without history , and it represents a complete copy of one time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
differential f@@ uss : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snap@@ shot at two time points : the full backup and the last differential release .
incre@@ mental backup : backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . it generates several snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time by making such a f@@ use system at the next with the exception that it is only dis@@ car@@ ded and not continuously .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily configure the difference of file transfer scripts . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts have been compressed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh .
secure important pictures directly after you have stored it on your computer to DVD or another optical media .
this approach makes you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time you will come to a weekly moment of the last 7 @-@ 14 days . at the end you will have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days and a snap@@ shot for each month . every additional th@@ inning should be done manually after which you have done a complete review .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; topics : metadata , in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated with images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , vision , ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 year , that is around the period in which you really remember you are interested in your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be observed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the future is un@@ fore@@ se@@ eable due to nature , you have to consider and re@@ assess the current system . unfortunately , there are no other option to ask yourself as the current system back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this question should actually be answered by using the explanations in this document , and change to open standards that are supported by many applications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; virtualization is now available for everyone . so if you have an old system to read when reading your pictures is important , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the Council is simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your storage and backup technology , or your file format , should you want to convert your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . remain with open standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scal@@ ability is the specialist to change a system in its size . this means always enlarge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s go out of that you have launched the scal@@ ability , and set the area that you want to enlarge on a dedicated record or partition . with * nothing systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area to a new record : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check with the d@@ mes@@ g command , whether your new record was detected by the system , but hang it not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open Source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software is able to read more , then you can create this by one year easier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
GIF is a proprietary patented format that disappears slowly from the market . you should therefore not use it anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ NG was developed as an open source standard , but it can save much more . it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , but not as many as T@@ IFF requires and a slow compression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
T@@ IFF was widely used as a format format . T@@ IFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm . there is no problem with some cameras . there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The digital negative file format is a free and open format format that was developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the T@@ IFF / EP format and comm@@ its for use of metadata . a hand@@ ful camera manufacturer is already available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon .
this is possibly one of the reasons why in order to em@@ bed the XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ forms ; it is a mixture of XML and R@@ DF ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata platform ; data file is stored for XML / R@@ DF .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many photographers prefer to archive a original of your recording , mostly in the raw format , but it can be used to archive the metadata separately from the image file . therefore , you should consider if you use D@@ NG as container and place everything together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata initiative is an open organisation consisting of a wide range of applications and modelling , discussions and collabor@@ ative work on the D@@ C@@ MI projects , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and surveillance efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . so long the images on the camera holder are used , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your blank archive . this feature is not implemented yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a fin@@ alist editing you can use external programs . if you return the pictures with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ t , then you should add the metadata again . these were cut off from other programs under circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use the processed images for copyright with digital water@@ marks . then export it into Web@@ gal@@ eries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ . in the section adding a photos to an album you will be able to add a lot of advanced settings to import images to your Alb@@ end@@ aten@@ bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zer , connect the camera to the display mode and turn on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you start the camera interface , this will not take a while . if this is the case , the file name and a symbol for file access is displayed . some cameras are not displayed on the camera for any file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need to see camera information on each entry . with the side@@ bars properties and metadata from the camera interface you can see the characteristics of an entry or metadata . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this dialog shows File Properties and the photo information that are stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the picture has not been downloaded to your computer . note that there are no information available for some digital cameras . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tab metadata features the internal metadata such as EX@@ IF , Manufac@@ turers , GPS etc. of the image . note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the easiest way to download photos on their computer is the click on the button to download , and then download the photos from her camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ . when downloading the images securely in an album , before you delete the photos from the camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you don &apos;t want to download all photos you want to download and select the selected photos , select the button download and then select the chosen button until you selected some photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your camera supports this , an option is available for download . these images have been selected until now . in this case the new pictures have been selected with a star in advance window . if you choose this option , only the new pictures will be downloaded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you download the buttons all or download the selected CD , the list of existing albums will be displayed in which the recordings are sorted , displayed as usual folders . then select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after choosing the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ came ; invites the photos from the camera to the album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete all of them by delete the button . if you want to delete all of it , you have to select this first and then delete the delete chosen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note that there is no way to recover from the camera . so you should delete the photos from the camera . if you do not want to delete it from the camera , you should carefully delete it from the camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cameras are frequently used as a file name for the photos frequently . this can be used once again after the photos of the camera . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the photos and the time when the image was taken into the file name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next section , you will find options for turning and mirrors the image and file based . if you use this latter option , it will automatically create a folder per day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the options During the transmission opens three more options , which are carried out before the photos will be saved from EX@@ IF information to the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , if you wish to use another format format as the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo % Y@@ - % -@@ % % : % . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use the camera fil@@ en@@ ames option , you have the option to change the fil@@ en@@ ames in lower@@ case letters . or in upper@@ case letters if you prefer that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ came ; for a photo is used , which will be displayed below the name , the camera will be stored and automatically used when you open the camera window for the next time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ des ; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera to take the camera to turn off . not all cameras are available for information about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automatic rotation is normally switched on , and when your camera wants to turn off this information , use the button Advanced and select the automatic rotation in the bottom range of the window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when your camera makes information about the date when the photo was made available on the photo . all images with the same date will be made available . all images with the same date are available in the same sub album . not all cameras are available in the same sub album . in the section side@@ bar Met@@ a data you can refer to which information could be embedded in the photos .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this option is normally switched off , and in this case you store &amp; digi@@ ti@@ t . if you want to change this option . use the Advanced button on the lower end of the window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the easiest way to upload photos from your computer on your camera is the button download . then , in which you can upload the files you can upload . you can also select more than one file with the Standard &amp; K@@ DE ; methods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the picture selection is completed , &amp; digi@@ came ; you , where the images will be loaded , select the desired folder and press OK to launch the upload . images will not be deleted from your computer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
GPS ( Global Position@@ ing System ) is used as a general concept in this document . this means a position that can be displayed in long@@ itude and la@@ titudes and can be found on a map . the identification of data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian GLO@@ NAS , the European Galil@@ eo or any other system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise ge@@ ographic place . not everyone uses an aircraft using GPS data to carto@@ graphy . environmental plann@@ ers , military , police , architectural offices and estate ma@@ sts can use this ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have forgotten your photo later , you can open a browser that shows the area when you wish to loc@@ alize the area when you want to loc@@ alize the site or simply assign this aspect to another photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question is how to get the GPS data into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v2 has to reach many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical references ( manual ) and last via manual input of well @-@ known places . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as we know there is currently no camera integrated in a GPS unit . but there is a few to work with GPS receivers . either as a card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; downloading the GPS data from one device can be done using g@@ ps@@ man or G@@ PS@@ Babel , because it is the only format that is supported by the ge@@ ographic assignment module . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ relate the data of pictures and GPS . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&amp; brochure holders ; tries to give you much control of its operations as possible . there are many settings to set up the behavior of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ . to set up the setup dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the icons of the left page .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select action can be displayed on embedded preview or image processing set . so , you place the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ h ; firmly , if you click on an entry in the main view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically selected to the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields as the option is written when downloading the camera interface is written into the IP@@ TC fields . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &apos;s title is a syn@@ onym for author lines : this field should be the professional name of the photographer . as this is a more detailed photograph , freelance photographer or an independent , commercial photographer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the IP@@ TC actions store the data into the respective IP@@ TC Fel@@ der@@ . thus , the metadata is permanently contained in the image and can not only be obtained in the database of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ . these metadata is also imported and imported without lost . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings of the light@@ box by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ h ; can be switched on this page . any images have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one , then you can only receive one more visible results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by default , image processing uses a black background behind the shown photographs . if you prefer another color , you can turn them off here . you can disable the tool@@ bars when you use the image processing in full screen mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of a picture can be marked with dark or bright color in the image . these colors are set here , with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 can be switched on and off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using P@@ NG @-@ compression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation reduces the image data to be used as P@@ NG . if you have a fast calcul@@ ator , you can put this emphasis on high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 high compression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the T@@ IFF files option you can comp@@ ress the def@@ ensive compression algorithm for T@@ IFF images . this reduces the size of the T@@ IFF images . it has no effect on image quality since the def@@ ending algorithm uses loss of loss .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if you select any loss of JPEG 2000 files , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , metadata is not yet supported , but was in the planning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ tised , the image processing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently it develops quickly with a tool to manipul@@ ate your photos . with this dialog you can change the image processing settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the default value is that all green pixels are the same . if you use this option with a minimal loss of details . this option exc@@ els the image with a minimal loss of details . this option imp@@ ose a bit soft , elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 gl@@ itter@@ ing pattern using the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this option is set , white off the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this setting is only used if the white is not set . standard is it a fixed colour balance , which was photographed on a white card representing the sunlight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . the use of the second sensors will get the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps will get more details in the top lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the default is the go@@ at@@ ters , so the parts of your camera are introduced to capture the peak white in various shades . most recently , you can try some parts of the missing information from the sh@@ orts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red . &amp; d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ produce the missing green and red proportions . of course this is a question of how much color or white you want .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select the option , you get the option to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be individually adapted to each image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . however , you probably need to put it somewhat higher than the standard 1 . this can also be used later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ y , you should be conservative . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a demo @-@ vo@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to produce a complete picture of the sub @-@ filtered image sensor , which have many cameras and is known as CFA @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests , the first algorithm was produced by D@@ cra@@ w . it creates colour art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges . Bil@@ in@@ ear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with acceptable result . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you know the color of your lenses , you can place the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for gra@@ dation correction when you are carried out during the rough conversion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a profile transl@@ ates the color @-@ information , and gives instructions as they should be given . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ ti@@ des in the others to translate the colors as closely as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behavior Questions if a picture is opened in the image processing module / color management module with blank files .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click here to save the folder , such as / us@@ r / share / color / color / .@@ color / ICC , where you will save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ came ; exam@@ ines this folder during startup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; settings of ICC Pro@@ files you have the option &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to leave , everything can be changed when opening the raw file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here , only your images are colored not the entire screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; input profiles should be used to the camera manufacturer and model that you are using . not all profiles are contained in the same manner . there are some , like Canon , which have no color mapping or gam@@ ma@@ fix . this means that you do not have to carry the color mapping yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are further options such as the soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , with which you can em@@ ulate , as your printer can work again as your camera and some colors , so you could manually correct , rather than rely on the blind algorithm of your printer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for most cameras it is quite apparent which colour profile is provided for them . unfortunately , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is obviously in@@ official : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Canon extension leaves the style for the goal : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for neutr@@ als , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; K@@ DE ; image plug@@ in interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; K@@ DE ; image numbers and image processing are supported ; many modules support which support the K@@ IP@@ I interface to work together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your distribution is installed by the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can see a list of available modules , and these modules will appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the pre@@ text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; short commands for tasks that are carried out by modules , can be set in menu with Settings Short@@ commands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I modules you can get via the K@@ IP@@ I project using htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ in@@ .org or in the manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the se@@ ash@@ ore settings should be easy to understand . the upper kno@@ bs adjust the time between the image transi@@ tions , usually are 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other drives turn off on the other end of the pictures during the ad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the camera properties are shown on the left hand a list of all available cameras . on the right side there is a button automatic detection connected to identify the camera . currently , serial USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage are now supported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the bottom end you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) -@@ mass storage camera . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / case where you attach your camera to the camera .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zer , you need to connect the camera to your computer using the display mode and turn on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did you try out whether &amp; digi@@ ti@@ cked ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after you set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can select any name for your camera . this will appear in the menu cameras of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the option of confir@@ ming dialog for re@@ loc@@ ating &gt; images in the tr@@ ash@@ can display , you can set the conver@@ gence of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ . to delete a photo and del@@ etion of a record you will find more details . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the editorial changes due to the right side bar can be applied , if you use the option changes in the right side bar without trace@@ able . otherwise , you have to apply the changes to the button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also include the screen of welcome screen from &amp; digi@@ ti@@ t ; when starting , it accelerates the start process of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking for a new photos to search for new photos , the base folder was deleted after new or deleted albums / photos . if something from the Base folder was removed , you ask whether it should delete it from the database . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
different colour schem@@ as can be used in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ t ; to adapt the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected using settings from the tool@@ bar . a preview of available designs is listed below :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ pack , you will find more information about this tutorial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; digi@@ came ; includes a quick image processing with some basic tools . you can use these to view your photos , and for correction and improvement . image processing can be launched onto the preview of a picture or by clicking on the preview ad / Edit menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image processing contains a range of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are not part of your distribution . for further information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules you will find in the image processing section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a status bar at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current disk number , and the current image size indicates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a menu bar at the top edge and among them the tool@@ bars for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the editing features of the image processing change your photos . no more of the functions can be used , before you can &apos;t recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the original photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you should therefore add a copy of your picture , before you change it . this can save you with file saving as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image to restore the image processing back in the tool@@ bar . you lose any change that you have done on the photo since the last store . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; virtually any action of the image processing can be revers@@ ed or restored , the last action can be revers@@ ed by selecting or restored , by selecting the Edit menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use this frequently , you should get the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; z for the und@@ o and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to restore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; click on the back or restore button in the tool@@ bar , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions will also be revers@@ ed or restored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you have started the image processing you can move between the photos of the same album or the same keyword in the tool@@ bar , click image down or the entries in the menu file , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can get in the photo , zoom out in which you will use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse cycle or symbols in tool@@ bars or entries in the menu menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : enhance the magni@@ fication factor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; view Full Screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . usually , you can see this in the setup dialog by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ . you can also call this in the setup dialog by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ . you can also see this section on the setup of image processing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to print the current image , you can print a picture in the menu and get the Standard &amp; K@@ DE ; printer dialog . you can download the settings before you print your photo here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the main menu you can print single pictures or whole sentences . all image files can be printed from your selection , and you only need to select the pictures from your selection . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you just need to make your choice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; digi@@ master &apos;s main window has a side bar on the right edge , which is important information and actions for the selected pictures , also available in the image processing . it will appear when one of the five riders will be cli@@ cked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multiple times Click on the same rider leaves the side@@ bar , and again disappear into the edge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the labels view you can type or insert notes with unlimited size . this means that all special characters are permitted , so that all special characters can be copied to EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC@@ - fields . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the IP@@ TC data support only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are modified after 2000 characters , if you want to use IP@@ TC labels in other applications , you should consider these limitations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after having commented it , use either the button use or change easily to the next picture , the labels will be saved then . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the use button , there is a button more . with this you can also read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also select the metadata in the files you have always written into the pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the section review shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searches and sorting . it can be applied to a single click of the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 .
the assessment is written in the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . en@@ coding follows the diagram in the following table :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the stit@@ ch view shows a search box for the key words , the keyword , and a selection box with the previously in these &amp; digi@@ tised ; -@@ session adjusted j@@ ig@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the keyword is dynam@@ ically adapted to the given keyword . you can limit the number of ways when searching for a keyword quickly , if you have many words . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the input field at the bottom end is another relief for the entry of keywords in a picture series . if you have entered different keywords , they are stored for quick access . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding tick fields in the tree . all words of a picture are stored in the IP@@ TC field Key@@ word . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if several pictures are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword in the keyword , if you want to select a selection with a keyword , please read the keyword password . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the side@@ bar code filter is used to change the selection of the images shown in the main window . usually , the left side bar is used with their album , - Dat@@ ing , keyword and search results , only the cutting quantity of these two will be displayed . all created key words are available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also drag and drop them . if the keyword is already available , you can draw it from the right side bar and put it on the selection . then , a dialog will ask if you want to put the keyword . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the upper example , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . the keyword is selected on three pictures , and after that a keyword was put out of the right keyword in the selection and set aside . a dialog will ask if this keyword will be set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this search for changes takes place at any start of the program . it can also be switched off under settings Miscellaneous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have a rule with and create , that it should be one or its , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 1 ) : the entry , looking for the database in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , which is already set in the database . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can select an extended search of all the elements of the database with the following options :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to group options , just use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button . the options then look as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why have Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flickr not listed ? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save images in the full resolution there .
this article / Tut@@ orial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mostly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ came ; s specific implementation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason why one is using a color@@ less workflow is that the colors have the colors of your camera or scanner , and you can print the colors on your monitor or using the colors that you print or publish it out of your digital dark . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the theme is coming to color management , everybody wants to know what buttons he must express for the results which he wishes to make informed decisions allow you to make informed decisions about your own informed decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your image work@@ flows meets all the criteria listed below , then you don &apos;t have to worry about colour management . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are working on a monitor cali@@ br@@ ated on the RGB colour space . ( further information can be found below )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your only other image spending is by e @-@ mail or the web , which is RGB the de facto standard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so if s@@ RGB does so well work and life for all so easy , why should I use another colour space and thus have to make thought about colour bl@@ ur@@ n@@ g ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colors that we can see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see is the hu@@ fe@@ isen@@ ous region and the colors in the RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger color flowers , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms page and click on information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do I have to calculate my monitor if I decided to work only in the RGB colour space ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes ! whether you are working in the RGB colour space or not , you need to calculate your monitor . then you need to calculate your monitor from RGB default , then you must either use your monitor on the s@@ RGB default profile or both . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions available , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , before you try a further manual processing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the functions norm@@ alize , equal , automatic and contrast from the menu Kor@@ rig@@ ating Automati@@ cally correction are automatically trying to experiment the best . they are to experiment with these effects to see which works best at your photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the same : this method adju@@ sts the ampli@@ fication of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of an intensive image , sometimes produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation that leads either miracles on a picture , or it destroys it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
automatic cut : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . determine the dark and bright red tones and adju@@ sts the red and green channels to the complete hist@@ ogra@@ ms .
contrast : this method enhances the contrast and lumin@@ ous intensity of the RGB values of a picture by moving the lowest and highest values in between . this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white off from &amp; digi@@ ti@@ came ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry the white off of a photo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the white @-@ off correction is slightly restricted because of a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per color , so if you can carry the white off in the blank mode , which means you can run the white off in the 16 @-@ bit mode , so your possibilities are getting better off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this tool is based on a white @-@ equivalent algorithm of the copyright protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ s . you can launch it via the menu entry colors white off of the image processing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left hand side , both the original image is adapted as well as the preview of the tool . if you want to see the original whi@@ stle , then it reaches the window window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the preview of the target company has a red mar@@ ker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel by this mar@@ ker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right above , a hist@@ ogram is indicated that once you have a parameter change . this hist@@ ogram can be very helpful . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . shadow adjustment allows you to improve or download the shadow details of your photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette and then click on the picture preview by using selected color to calculate the colour temperature of the white surface . this type will also automatically set the temperature and green values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; additionally , you can set the white off with the list of pre@@ ferences . the following settings are available : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the over@@ exposure dict@@ ator increases the colors , if more than a colour channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . this is displayed in the preview as pure indicator and does not have any effect on the final image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the buttons stores save as and loading exactly this . every setting of the white comparison you have set , you can store in a text file and re@@ load later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the default settings returns all the filter values back to their default values and the associated neutral white cover . note that also neutral settings will be displayed another photo than your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can set the coding depth per color channel of the processed picture . 8 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high quality images . this coding needs more disk space , calcul@@ us and stands only for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , T@@ IFF and D@@ NG . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tool opens the same dialogue as the editing of shell images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . a detailed manual for the use of color profiles , you can drag the chapter of color management . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another important tool is available in the menu below colors . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously , so that you can always adjust to the same error correction when your camera or your scanner should always be the same correction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation , that you can find under the colors of Gra@@ dation in the menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ff ; tool color effects offer you four color effects , a solar effect effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a can@@ oe filter available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in times of chemical processing was Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect of the image completed by the second lighting . this result was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the intensity controls the solar isation . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase is ultimately created a negative image that is not to create on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the solar panel . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that works the ( 2 ) . applied intensity is 30 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a sati@@ able effect effect , which makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . just try it emb@@ ell@@ ished lots of photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vel@@ via is the brand name for one to daylight . its name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers a few saturated colours in daylight and high contra@@ sts . but also some colored colors are especially vivid and too much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ne@@ on@@ Filter simul@@ ates Ne@@ on@@ light on the contrast . the parameter controls the brightness of the results , and the sli@@ der repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on@@ light . in large pictures the filter can re@@ lie@@ ve the entire CPU for a moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; digital cameras are common problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual to adjust the colour contrast and lumin@@ ous intensity of your photos , so as soon as you are satisfied with the results you can use the button O@@ k and you will be applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you can get a picture of bad lighting conditions , you can reduce your reverse problem . even in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice for satur@@ ation . all changes you can do in the preview . if Him do you like the changes you can confirm with O@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between the complex tool Gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool is very complicated for improving exposure . also if the dialog box is very complicated for this tool . concrete use the three be@@ aver below the hist@@ ogra@@ mm@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , an active channel or the selected area . below the graph , three slide values are cli@@ cked into the image and the right side represents the dark and right side the bright areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the simpl@@ est way to learn the control is to move the regulator , and take care of how the image changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the right hand side the original and preview of the picture can be previ@@ ew@@ ed . the preview is dynamic , with the at@@ titudes of the image , updated . on the left , the following options are available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scal@@ ability : with this selection box can be adjusted if the hist@@ ogram is shown with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . in pictures of a digital camera the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic approach is useful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three kno@@ b : the top for the dark tones , mean for the light sounds and the bottom for the middle tones , frequently called g@@ amma values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three color twe@@ ez@@ ers can be used in the preview of the original image , to adjust the input of shadows , medium and bright tones automatically . moreover , there is a button for full automatic adjustment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; returns : the selected values allow the selection of manual values for each area . for example , there are also two controls which can be used to create the output in@@ active as in the background and see something else in the foreground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the image values of the image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; save as and load : these buttons can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and later re@@ loaded , the Gim@@ p Levels format is used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes , the input can be re@@ adjusted to all shadows , medium and sun notes . activate the sample rate for rotary , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the over@@ exposed @-@ dict@@ ator controls all colour channels to find over@@ exposed pixels , which means you can see the effect only in the preview and it is no effect on the final result . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; below you see an example of the adjustment of the intervention rate applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output value are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image ( 2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the left , half of the original and the target image is displayed . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
modification channel : this selection box allows to indicate the channel which is changing from the module :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next to these boxes there are two symbols to switch between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures with large areas of constant color , the linear mode produces a broad beam . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , if you move a short section to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones can be correspon@@ d@@ ingly correspon@@ dent and the corresponding picture pixel darker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the preview of the original photos is a red markings to see . if you want to shift this mark on the curve , which is a suitable line on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . every turn you have created can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and later re@@ loaded . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you create this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes automatically create the check@@ points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , medium and sun notes . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ aires . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the over@@ exposed @-@ dict@@ ator controls all colour channels to show over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than a channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect on the final result . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
below you can see a black and white picture that was corrected in the lumin@@ ance canal . shadow and sun notes was applied with the colour pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ came ; image processing is a tool to improve colour channels , or change colour shades of the photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the channel mixer is another developed tool to mix the color tones of the images , you can edit it from the menu colors channel bl@@ ender of the image processing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first note as you can correct the relative distribution and rash . the left section of the window will show you a preview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preview of the target image comes with a red mark@@ ers . if you position it in the picture , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to indicate the corresponding colour value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the controls for the module are to the right : controls for red , green and construction enable the image to preserve it . this is especially useful when you activate the corresponding colour bl@@ ender . this is especially useful when you can also activate the colour bl@@ ender . try the green channel for black @-@ and @-@ white portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color becomes a visible noise from the colour space . if that &apos;s the case you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion and reduce the color space at first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any bl@@ ender setup can be used for later , and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the over@@ exposed @-@ dict@@ ator controls all colour channels to find over@@ exposed pixels , which means you can see the effect only in the preview and it is no effect on the final result . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been re@@ adjusted . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is enabled . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the image can be seen below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . in the development of digital photography is black / white a work step which can be easily converted on the machine . also with a set of movie roller profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green line filter . this looks good for portraits against the sky . so similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) green filter .
orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange la@@ sen@@ filter . this improved landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Oran@@ ge@@ Filter .
rotation filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red line filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simul@@ ate mo@@ on@@ light like the day time . so similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Rot@@ cher .
gel filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow linear filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Gel@@ b@@ arium .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : produces warm bright and middle tones . this is very similar to the process of a print and re@@ development in a sep@@ i@@ at@@ oner . this is very similar to the process of a print and re@@ development in a sep@@ i@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ tised ; tool texture allow you to apply decorative tex@@ tures on a picture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can look it like an oil painting on a wall . the menu entry picture texture apply to the image processing can be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
relief : shift this parameter to the right increases the presence of the depth and tr@@ inity of texture on the image .
a paper string effect has been applied on the picture below . the original image is ( 1 ) and that changed below ( 2 ) and the image of the image has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool frame can be added as a decorative frame to add a picture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to keep the eye of an ob@@ serving in the boundaries of a photos is no easy task . this is a psychological barrier to keep the image . under the picture frame , the module can be started using image processing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
type : with this parameter you adjust the desired frame type for your image . the picture ends with a thin line and a large three @-@ dimensional frame that fits with a thin three @-@ dimensional setting . ideal for a eyel@@ et effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the range for the width is 1 % to 50 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frame with the frame image will be greater than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for the print of images , especially when you use the tool after aspect ratio before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this practical tool , you can insert simple and format@@ ted text in a picture at any place . this goes even in several places if you need it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type the text and place it with its characteristics as you need . you will simply select a frame for the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you have stored on the button &quot; OK . &quot; after the picture has been saved , the text is part of the image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the &amp; digi@@ tised ; Tool St@@ en@@ cil can apply a template over a picture .
the Image templates menu apply in the image processing can be used to create templates over a picture .
for the sten@@ cil there are no restrictions about the size and orientation . if you want to use the P@@ NG file format and you should simply send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ pack ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ tised @-@ U@@ sers @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to copy your template folder with the Button Basic folder . you can select the folder click here for the next start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the root folder was set for templates , a tree structure is reflected in the folder structure . the selection of an folder is updated automatically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enlarge : this button increases the underlying image . it is cent@@ ered around the mouse position , check it with the left mouse button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ hr@@ ink : this button minim@@ izes the underlying image . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you must control the image accordingly . please check it with the left mouse button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shift : use this button to move under the picture below , take the image and place it on the desired position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . then the image will be adjusted automatically .
&amp; digi@@ came ; three different tools are available for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but generated , especially in dark areas , gran@@ ular images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; def@@ ici@@ ally mask works on the contrast of the edges to look a picture sharp@@ ness . indeed , it is a really good job . you can use it and it &apos;s a really good job . the algorithm was removed from Gim@@ p and he is copy@@ righ@@ ted by Winston Chang . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ref@@ using is possibly the best of the three , since he really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its use and has different parameters to adapt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photos without focus as well as most digital images need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is because the digi@@ tization process has to be put together with only minimal differences in a colour . SL@@ R cameras usually need more additional shar@@ pen@@ ing than normal cameras for the private user .
in JPEG pictures a camera has been used internal shar@@ pen@@ ing . images in the raw format must always be anno@@ yed during processing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some scanners apply to a sharp@@ ness of the image during the reading of the image , when you disable it , you get control of your image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some situations , you can get useful results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo of the sharp@@ ness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they should be careful with caution when the results do not seem very natural : the sharp@@ est technique increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but further enhance the noise . in general , you can obtain further information and comparison of all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw a bit soft with the menu entry , use the effect on the right side of the dialog box shows you the effect on your photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the filter is un@@ sharp and a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . you can see a demonstration here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original image and the preview can help the picture edit , the screen window shows the edition of the filter with the current settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and amount . the default values produce good results and should first try out the effect . when you create the def@@ ec@@ tivity , noise and the impression of gr@@ ats will produce sharp edges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the radius puts a lot of pixels on each side of a edge through the filter . high resolution pictures allow larger radi@@ i . they should therefore be best shar@@ pen@@ ed in their final resolution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ ped image , which is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the swelling value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and to apply the difference amount . in this way , areas can be used with a soft change between the killing and therefore beauty par@@ don in faces , Himm@@ ler and water surfaces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an example of un@@ sharp mas@@ cul@@ ating filters . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the working picture which was done with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a swelling = 0.0 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; digi@@ tised tool ; tool refra@@ in focus a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it was used by the protected extension filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tool tries to shar@@ pen a picture to &amp; quot ; re@@ foc@@ us@@ sing . this is better to shar@@ pen the photo . it is using a technique called F@@ IR Vienna filtering . this is better to use a def@@ ec@@ tivity . you can restart from the menu by using colors Ref@@ ok@@ us@@ ze in the image processing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in practice , the cir@@ cle@@ ment is much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding . the G@@ IR Wiener In@@ verse is also dependent on the source wall pixel , which is far from the original pixel and very strongly influenced by the removed pixel . those causes undes@@ irable results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the main parameter for using this module . it is the most important value for using this module . for most pictures you can set a higher value if your image is very un@@ sharp and then pay attention to hal@@ o vou@@ chers .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help to reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for correlation reduces the sharp@@ est effect of the module .
noise Filter : an increase of the noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however values are higher than 0.1 @-@ 1 . however , values are higher than 0.@@ 03 . if the noise level is too low . a usable value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will continue to dirty the image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to increase annoying art@@ ef@@ acts so you might also need to increase the correlation and / or oder@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . however , the size of the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you choose large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the pal@@ sy &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any refund parameter , which you have set , will be saved for later and then may be loaded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to perform all the cuts , colour@@ ings and intensity of intensity on the image before use the module . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , you should change the module before making the image differently . the reason for this is that lots of operations changes that are not immediately visible , but later abandoned arti@@ facts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you read and comp@@ ress pictures and access the image , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generally produces less sharply and better results than sharp@@ ens . this could be caused un@@ sharp mas@@ ked a larger neighborhood , used as a sharp@@ ness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; theore@@ tically , un@@ sharp mask must always produce arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never be the effect of the sharp@@ ness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; practically , the result of the F@@ IR Vienna Filter is always better for the processing of small details . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; below you can see a comparison between different filters , on a small un@@ focused picture , see : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this image has to be corrected . this picture has been taken with an anal@@ og@@ ous camera . the un@@ foc@@ ussed result is attri@@ but@@ able to insufficient light for the auto focus lens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for more information on the methods of the analysis in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sli@@ der smo@@ othing , the sharp@@ ness of the division has been dar@@ kened to create a more natural pup@@ il . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the color tin@@ te allows a customized colour for pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set it here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tool image error correction is one of the most developed tool in order to remove not desired art@@ ef@@ acts with an un@@ preced@@ ented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS lab@@ s in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different settings as key points to simpli@@ fy the restoration of the restoration . the available settings are listed below :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the tab of smooth@@ ness and advanced settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; details pane &#91; 0 &#93; 100 &#93; : this controls the conservation of details . a small value will result in uniform smooth@@ ness over the image . if the value of 0,@@ 9 should be more homogen@@ ous than necessary . please note that no shar@@ pen@@ ing should be additionally sub@@ ordin@@ ated to the guiding principle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; directions depen@@ dency Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ ed evenly in all directions , while a value close to 1 is only possible in one direction . JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value close to 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smo@@ othing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this puts the maximum smo@@ othing factor above all@@ . p then defines the relative smooth@@ ness . put this value to the degree of noise in your image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 &#93; 100 &#93; : this parameter is concerned with larger structures . the higher the value is set . this is necessary if you want to value the geometry of the picture . even if you want to produce a &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; repeti@@ tions : speci@@ fies how often the algorithm is gone through . usually here , 1 or 2 is sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
angle gradu@@ al da &#91; 5 &#91; 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic Alpha . if alpha is chosen , it should also be small . so you should choose that small angle a long run@@ time . so you should choose this amount as possible and un@@ acceptable to your needs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; integral steps &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step into pixels . you should avoid the value smaller 1 in order to avoid sub @-@ pixel gl@@ are and never bigger than 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation use : this More about quality that you receive by selecting this option is only low , but it doubles the run@@ time . therefore , we recommend it to allow him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the buttons save as and loading exactly do this . any adjustment of image errors can be saved in a text file , and later re@@ loaded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be comparatively very fast correct during work . however , it can still take very long and take a high CPU load immediately . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
below you can see how picture error has been corrected using small arti@@ facts . the module is shown in a photo that was created in Guatemala city with an anal@@ og@@ ous camera . as you see there is a very unique black arti@@ fact that the original image can be seen below ( 1 ) and corrected a corrected picture under ( 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digi@@ ti@@ y was a very powerful tool to reduce image noise , using a protected algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tool allows sel@@ ectable picture filter available to remove sta@@ ins and other arti@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of saved images from books or magazines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you need further information on the sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the screenshot of the screenshot shows a typical scene with a digital camera , and a high ISO sensitivity , which can be successfully removed using this tool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings will remain in the default settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) which is needed for the filter . high levels increase the image and color in it , and thus fixed a minor bug . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness of the filter . if the value is increased , you may need to re @-@ delete the edges process . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer receive and noise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
edges : controls the edge accuracy of the film . this value improves the frequency response of the Fil@@ ters . if it is too strong can &apos;t remove all the noise or rough@@ s you want to lose weight without details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the brightness of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change in order to improve a picture . this setting does not affect the smooth@@ ness process of which is controlled by the details settings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; color : controls the color tolerance of the image , we recommend you either color or lumin@@ ance to change an image . this setting does not affect the smooth@@ ness process of the image controlled by the details settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ mat@@ o@@ int@@ oler@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas that typically increased strongly . it also poll@@ uted the shadow zones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; d@@ amping : controls the adjustment of ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ d@@ amping . this value is defined as fast the adaptive filter radius of the lumin@@ ance . when it is increased , the edges appear to appear . it can remove noise points and is the recommended method . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; save under and load : these buttons are used exactly for that . all parameters are stored in the file system , and later loaded into the fil@@ esystem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of how rough@@ ing your life can change . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and it corrected ( 2 ) . the image reduction was used with the default settings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . luck@@ ily , the solution to draw a bit soft is much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen with the menu entry . use the effect on the right side of the dialogue with the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ came ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools around photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these filters are available to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , movie insp@@ ectors , scratches , compression and supple@@ mentary pictures as well as the human eye . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same algorithm can be used for pa@@ int@@ ance and tex@@ turing images . the algorithm for the restoration is performed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS lab@@ s in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ c and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts reduce the compression of JPEG is not perfect in some areas even far away from some areas ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed picture . this setting should correct these problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the buttons stores save as and loading exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file , and later re@@ loaded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can still take very long and take a high CPU load immediately . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
below you can reduce the picture with a low @-@ shaped space . the module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( TM ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious movie gra@@ ined on the faces below ( 1 ) and this corrected ( 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures were obtained on an old color photo that has been created with a scanner , and the original image can be seen below ( 1 ) and corrected the image below ( 2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; digi@@ came ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows you to remove the Hot@@ pixel of photos using a CCD camera , eight were used to remove algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are protected by Martin Dick@@ opp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem since many cameras have JPEG compression about a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; light pixel quot ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; download this file in the wiz@@ ard with the button dark image . the tool will see automatic and bright pixels , these are highlighted in the picture preview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you will find the dark picture directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixels using a CCD defects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should find the appropriate dark image to the correct picture . note that the wiz@@ ard will notice the final dark image and automatically re@@ charges this automatically in the next session . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture range and preview can be corrected you within the picture . the preview display shows the output of the filter , which shows the current settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select a area to watch the defective pixels on the preview , and the results of the film . select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the available filters : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dur@@ ation : it &apos;s an average of neighboring pixels . the resulting color will be assigned to all faulty pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , it is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
linear : all pixel blocks have a distance of 1 of pixel block ( 2 @-@ D@@ im ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ D@@ im ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ D@@ im ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quadra@@ tic : this is the default filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block , is pulled to charge a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ D@@ im ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ D@@ im ) or a group of square curves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kub@@ isch : all pixel with a distance of 3 or less will be pulled to charge a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ D@@ im ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ D@@ im ) or a group of cubic meters in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo taken from a defective digital camera using a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long expos@@ ing . the original image was enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is below ( 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sing correction ; Vig@@ net@@ tin correction is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net@@ h , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , a picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wide angle lens objects which in particular the medium and large photo format can often illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ ady ) you can reduce the corners and edges of the picture by taking the light of the sensor there . tel@@ e@@ objective also indicate this behavior .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he also has dis@@ advantages . many Center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 at the aper@@ ture filter , which is impossible to keep the camera with hand . wide angle lens should also be made using the center filter , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , because otherwise unknown forces are created . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the big exposure areas of today felt film and colour @-@ stu@@ res of digital cameras and film scanner , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of an oil filter by using a Cent@@ er@@ filter . the algorithm is protected by a Cent@@ er@@ filter . the algorithm is copy@@ righ@@ ted by John Walker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with three shelves , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ able correction filter and with three more exposure of the target picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
density : this parameter controls the degree of light thickness at the point of the largest density . the standard density is 2.0 that compens@@ ate the density to compens@@ ate the density of a greater degree of Vig@@ net@@ . reduce the density to compens@@ ate it for a greater degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : the editing of a picture with the Vig@@ net@@ tin correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you need to re@@ adjust the exposure of the target picture with these options , as you only need to increase the settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want a fin@@ ing reflection of the target picture , let the values for light intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ y ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ cip@@ ation correction to a picture . the right image ( 1 ) shows the Vig@@ r@@ tic image in the corners and ( 2 ) the correct picture . a lamp and contrast correction was also performed with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ff ; Lin@@ der@@ distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a protected algorithm by David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric distortion . color@@ less distortion can not be corrected using this tool .
the co@@ effici@@ ents of the second degree is treating the overall geomet@@ ric distortion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or conve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third pillar has a similar round effect but fla@@ ws along the edges . this correction does not apply in the tool .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coefficient of the coefficient correc@@ ts the removed corners to the second degree . if you combine these two geomet@@ ric distortion types , almost elimin@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; general : this value controls the strength of distortion second degree . with negative values , ton@@ ical dist@@ or@@ tions may be corrected and positive values dec@@ lining distortion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; corner : this value controls the strength of distortion fourth . this value is stronger at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most l@@ enti@@ ls , the &apos; corners parameter the reverse sign of the parameter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and thus creates a correction of the first degree . negative values enlarge while positive the image shr@@ inks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bright : this value adju@@ sts brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values reduce brightness of the picture in the corners , while positive values they increase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to help you find the best filter settings , illustrated the dialog with a preview of distortion correction . the values that you use for your image will be saved and used as default values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ton@@ - or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed prior to all supply or size changes . if you re@@ side an image and after that an ton@@ ical correction would be performed .
to help you find the best correction to help you find this tool a vertical and a horizontal relief line to fix it . in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the dotted lines with the help of the lines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you correct a ver@@ tic@@ ular distortion , the resulting image will be black edges . you can remove them from the image processing tool from the image processing or the zoom kno@@ b of this dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for most pictures the tone @-@ shaped correction is sufficient for some moti@@ fs , such as recordings from the front , frames and paintings , it is correct to correct all angles in the picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the ton@@ ical correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate infrared film from the G@@ imp@@ gur@@ u.@@ org website that is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( TM ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ ra movie , see these URL . this film has a sensitivity area of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
below the preview can you want to simul@@ ate two parameters of film insp@@ ections and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the range of film grains and domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in conversion . green law@@ ns are white as snow !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the filter color channels are used to re@@ produce inf@@ ra @-@ red film , especially the green channel does not make sense to apply the effect on black / white photographs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the inf@@ ra @-@ film application applied to an landscape photo of New Zealand . the original image is set under ( 1 ) and the image of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a type of au@@ ra in the peak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the order to re@@ produce film grains , such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , is well known for the sensitivity of the films by mixing high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the film effect effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , Str@@ ong Phot@@ ographic sight especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , so you have to use this filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the controller the ISO sensitivity can be cali@@ br@@ ated to the control of intensity and gran@@ ularity of the grains , even though higher values need to be applied to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of film grains on a black / white image . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) film sensitivity to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zer type ; filter oil paintings produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zer type ; filter oil paintings give your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting . nature and style live are good for this effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two controls to influence the effect . the top cho@@ oses the brush size between one and five . thick brushes are better for large pictures . smooth the smooth@@ ness or , from the other side , the arti@@ sti@@ tion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the oil paintings effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the original is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 @-@ pixel image is 1 and smo@@ othing 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ke ; filter coal drawing uses colour and intensity gra@@ dients to create a cab@@ es@@ k@@ iz@@ ze . the images of their gra@@ dient are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful for you to outline what scene you had chosen to sk@@ etch you . that would be good pictures to start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two controls with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper kno@@ b sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smo@@ othing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the carbon label filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default value of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; digi@@ master ; filter engraving has shaped your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; digi@@ master ; filter engraving is a quick tool to give your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with a simple structure , in which colour is not the most important at content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray @-@ plain landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the working picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo in an artwork by distortion sound effects . it uses protected algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wavel@@ eng@@ ages 1 : divide the image into cells and lets it look like it is considered by glass blocks .
wavel@@ ength 2 : analog to the wavel@@ ength 1 is dist@@ orted to the image here with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can break these effects at any time with the button .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo in an artwork by bl@@ ending effects . it uses protected algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
zoom &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; zoom bl@@ ur@@ ring : bl@@ ur@@ red the image along a serious line . this simul@@ ates a zo@@ oming camera , which creates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
radi@@ al im@@ sharp@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ red the image by rotating the pixels around a point . this simul@@ ates the shar@@ per of a turn@@ able camera .
removal of sharp@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused comra@@ des . the object seems to appear in the background .
motion @-@ sharp@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ red the image by horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a linear motion . z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing camera image .
soft@@ ness St@@ sharp@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ red the picture soft into the dark and strongly in the bright tones . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or add a warm and subtle glow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ üt@@ tel@@ un@@ sharp@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ red the picture by random displac@@ ement of pixels , and simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of an arbitrary motion camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
smart t@@ sharp@@ ness : finds the color bas@@ ins in the picture and bl@@ ur@@ red them without changing the rest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo in rectangular cells and then created it , by filling with an average pix@@ el@@ value , new . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some effects require long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the shelves are a nice little tool to make rain drops to your image . this gives it a stunning appearance . it uses a stunning appearance . it uses a protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dropping size allows to change the size of the drop . since the dri@@ p size is not automatically increasing with the size of the image , it changes the size and density of the drop . fish changes the visual effect of the drop in the image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can hold a range from reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es using the &amp; digi@@ plug . use the selection tool to set the area freely , e.g. a face , which should remain free from shelves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the ra@@ ind@@ rops Fil@@ ters . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the working picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can take it through mirrors or turning into the right orientation . you can find the tools in the menu of trans@@ forming turning mirrors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photo infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most advanced tools , in order to enlarge a photo at a minimal loss of image quality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a picture to S@@ hr@@ ink is simple . the great question is , how can you infl@@ ate a picture and guess what the limits of the resolution are done ? how can you get a good work here ? try it and you will see it yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can change it to the desired size with the tool size and enter the target values . the dialog box can be seen below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tool to size change a linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation Method to approach the pixels . if you want to increase a little picture with a better quality , then try the tool to infl@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many educational programs are using a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation . for example Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ s in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need to tell the tool how to change the size , these settings are available in the tab New size and are listed below : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; keep aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the new size allows the aspect ratio of the original image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 &#93; 100 &#93; : this parameter is concerned with larger structures . the higher the value is set . this is necessary if you want to value the geometry of the picture . even if you want to produce a &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the buttons save as , and loading are used exactly . any insert for photo may be saved as text file and later re@@ charged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photo infl@@ ating is very fast where it makes , but it can still take very long and take a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see below an example for photo infl@@ amm@@ ate , adding a small color screen to the double size . the original ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) is the result of the linear standard aug@@ mentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cutting of a photo is not only a frequently under@@ rated operation , but also a frequently under@@ rated tool to squee@@ ze a picture . to make a photo you need to create a picture . you will then see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you release the mouse button , the area of the photos will be cut off . thus you can make a good overview like your photo after the cut . you can make a new rect@@ angle with the left mouse button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you &apos;re satisfied with the cutting button , use the kno@@ cking button of the image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo will be cut under the menu file to save the re @-@ cut photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the front area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by shifting the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog will remain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the mold to cut aspect ratio , you can specify orientation in portrait format or landscape format . in the portrait format the larger value of the height and in the landscape format is assigned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tool allows to crop a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same , regardless of whether you see cen@@ timet@@ res , inches or any other physical size . for example , you can see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the right end of the dialogue , two buttons no longer exist horizont@@ ally or vertically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in dialogue , you can set up with the Max . ratio button for cutting down the maximum possible , depending on selected relationship and orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tool allows to cut its settings again depending on the orientation tool ( horizontal or vertical ) , so that the EX@@ IF data are reflected in the EX@@ IF data so that the EX@@ IF data are reflected in the cut image and not the original image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings of union help allow help to make help , so that you can put your images better . these help are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
harmonic triangle : harmonious parti@@ tions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . as the third @-@ level rule , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle into the diagonal tri@@ angles .
golden middle : the golden middle is a division that is based on various natural growth samples such as the spir@@ als of a Nau@@ til@@ us mus@@ sel or the leaf sheets of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things we feel beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and the Greeks to put the golden division in all times when you put your paintings , buildings and even photos to put together a natural order and beauty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 13 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the golden centre produces more fluid lines , when you put together a picture . these aids are en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed below : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to achieve the Golden spiral , you will achieve good results for your photos . in comparison to third @-@ level rule the golden spiral produces a liquid line of the eye along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual river . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another rule is the rect@@ angle of the golden spiral , also called golden square . it should be a line to slide the golden spiral . this can be one line or different objects . this can simply be there without the eye , it will fulfill its task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Golden Tri@@ angles also deri@@ ve from the golden tri@@ angles below . its failure points are the middle points of the golden rect@@ angle . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not a tr@@ unc@@ ated tri@@ angles . diagonal to these lines can be dynam@@ ically released . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create a effect of professional photographer dynamic symmet@@ ry . try your image focus on one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Op@@ al lists and tik@@ al options may be used to mirror the harmonic part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the button color you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , you can adjust the color of the lines your current image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the free rotation is a tool to turn a picture to each angle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you make a photo then it &apos;s easy to hold the camera exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture that rot@@ ates the camera by an angle , image processing and the tool free rotation and adjust the target angle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rot@@ ate your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this slide are given in degrees . with the button Pre@@ ferences , you can reset the slide to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for your help , the Free Rotation module displays a horizontal and vertical line . after you move it over an important point of the picture , you can fix it with a pressure on the left button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you rot@@ ate a picture , you &apos;ll find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair it is to use the function trans@@ forming cro@@ pping from the image processing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an elegant way to cut the picture is automatic cut , and select one of the following options : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es a bit after turning , but note the warning warning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all perspective trans@@ formations will be performed by a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares in the corners of your image . you will then automatically re@@ comp@@ ute some information which will help you to change the perspective : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas that are created by transformation , in pixels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas that are created by transformation , in pixels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
angle left above : indicates the current angle in degrees on the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle right above : indicates the current angle in degrees on the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left down : shows the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right down : shows the current angle in degrees on the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after adjusting the perspective the picture becomes a bit dirty . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments produce a double so strong effect and you should avoid this when possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you adapt the perspective , you get unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a possibility to ber@@ some it is to cut the picture with trans@@ forming cro@@ pping from the image processing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sched@@ uling tool is used to move a part of the picture into one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . this is no rotation , the image will be dist@@ orted into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shape your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you press pre@@ ferences , you can display horizont@@ ally and vertically . a preview of the effect will appear and the new dimensions of the target picture will be shown on the right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to your help you will end a vertical and a horizontal line . move the mouse on an important point , like the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to adjust your image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after taking the sh@@ earing off , the picture will be a bit bl@@ ur@@ red . this effect is mostly negli@@ gible , but two bra@@ c@@ ements are more negli@@ gible , so you should avoid this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the closing , the picture has tri@@ angular tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a possibility to eliminate it , cut the picture with trans@@ forming cro@@ pping from the image processing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; digi@@ came ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to write and write in some cases , in some cases , you will comp@@ ile a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give you a list of all file formats available on its system . however , you will always find JPEG and T@@ IFF . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ came ; shows only files in formats that knows . this is done using the file extension and a comparison of those with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is displayed in the list . you can change this list of file extensions ; you can change this list for further information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or T@@ IFF . some cameras allow you to find even the using file formats . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ came ; supports both formats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; image compression is the application of data compression procedure on digital pictures . redundant information , thus saving the image data to a more efficient way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG with the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also save any loss of loss if this is displayed in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw format in English . you can convert raw format pictures in JPEG . you can convert raw format pictures in JPEG or T@@ IFF with the rough Converter of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ . in the section configuration you can further find information on the use of modules with &amp; accessories ;
&amp; digi@@ came ; supports the loading of raw pictures only with the program d@@ cra@@ w which is contained in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ . all support cameras can be seen at the bottom of the web page from Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of resource formats that are supported by &amp; digi@@ came ;
many digital cameras support the recording short films . these clips are frequently stored in AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG @-@ format . but if you click on a movie file and will not use any built @-@ in options to view movies . &amp; K ; settings to play movies use the program to start playback .
go forward to the previously visited album in Chron@@ ik . you can only go ahead when you went back before .

all configured cameras are listed here . you can use the camera to add from the menu to add a new camera to the list . please check in the camera for further information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ IP@@ I module exports a series of pictures in a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed with goo@@ gle@@ Earth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you exchange the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well when the initial contrast was very good , you can perform the first four alignment with the module White . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many tools you need to be done in &amp; digi@@ came ; included , and follow your description here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all image processing tools such as sharp@@ ness , plas@@ tici@@ zing , rough@@ ing supp@@ ress , refra@@ in fla@@ p , &amp; etc . use a uniform dialog box before the filter is applied to the actual picture . below you see &amp; quot ; texture user @-@ quot ; in this dialog : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bal@@ ken shows the status of the filter to the current image . left of him allow five buttons to change the compar@@ ative mode of the front @-@ area . these modes are :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vertically , without dup@@ lication . the left section shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; horizont@@ ally , without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper section shows the original and the lower displays the filter applied to the area below the selected area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the left section shows the original and the right to the effect of the filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; horizont@@ ally , the upper section shows the original and the lower part to the effect of the filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &apos; mouse over &apos; -@@ style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the fore@@ sight , and otherwise the original . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( 2 ) There are two buttons available to show you in order to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the used colors can be adjusted in the general setup page .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 3 ) : as part of the preview , you can draw this frame with the mouse within the image and preview it on the part of the image , the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 5 ) : in the lower left corner , here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all adjustment from the last use of the module are noted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the side@@ bar features shows the essential information about the selected image , and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photo characteristics : shows a summary of the main parameters of shooting the photos . these data are from EX@@ IF data , when these are available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is a editor for p@@ all@@ ets files . the application can be used to edit color p@@ all@@ ets and select colors , and use colors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the p@@ all@@ ets files that are installed by &amp; K@@ DE ; can be installed either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; K@@ DE ; settings and hot user defined color and Zul@@ u used colors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a dialog box , you can select from a list of the installed p@@ all@@ ets or search the folders to files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cur@@ sor is displayed as a line in the p@@ allet . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shows on the color next to it . the color is described under the p@@ allet view . here , the color name can also be changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can also be used to elect . in order to create such a variety , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor there . then move the mouse at pressed left mouse button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the check box is inserted under the button color , the color is inserted from the color box on the cur@@ sor . the color is selected or over@@ writing one another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write is selected , you can select the check box under Bei@@ m C@@ ursor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; graph@@ s and k@@ graph viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing and graphic programs . graph@@ s are contained in science , especially in informa@@ tics , especially in informa@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , there were no modern and GUI ; - or &amp; cl@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programs with only a few features . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; k@@ graphic viewer , project has set itself the goal to replace these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; K@@ DE ; program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; graph@@ s and k@@ graph viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing and graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; shows graph@@ s with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; K@@ DE ; programs in a modern and user friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph in &amp; Kate ; the graph re@@ charged and in &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; Kate ; open or open the graph in &amp; k@@ graphic ; in one &amp; Kate ; component
loading of large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems from about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to present more than these knots )
further needed software : &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ program that requires the &amp; graph ; -@@ Tool &amp; dot ; for representation of graph@@ s . required :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main window displays the opened graph@@ s , each in its own window . in this case , the main window will open , as in the lower screen photo . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list . click on the first icon to open the File dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; -@@ files selected , the main window looks like in the lower screen photo : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed when the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special buttons , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; key ) ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; zoom is restricted in both directions by factor 10 , below you see the maximum sh@@ red@@ ding of a graph . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the file has just been converted into &amp; k@@ graphic ; loaded file from another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can choose whether the graph will be re@@ loaded or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graphical viewer , so you can also change your decision later , so you can set up your choice Settings k@@ graphic viewer ; see also . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you open a graph outside of a current &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; file extension , &amp; eg ; in file browser or on the command line , you would like to open a new &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; the instance would like to open or apply to la@@ yed graph@@ s in a sub@@ window of the already running instance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with the last option you can save your choice permanently , but also change them with setup dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at program start , you can open all graph@@ s of your last session . again , you can save your choice both as well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also set , how the graph will be divided on several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use several pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph have to be adjusted to one page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be completed by the respective parts of the graph . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
page show with one on several pages distributed graph@@ s without head@@ line and with another font
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the site Er@@ ne@@ ut Laden gives the ability to determine if a file has been changed on the hard disk , and you can define a standard behaviour ( automatically re@@ load or ignore the changes ) or the program every time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the page open is the way to determine how a graph is opened out of a current session , or specify a default behavior for that case or specify in a sub@@ window of the already running session , or determine that every time you are asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the page seat management gives the possibility to set up the start behaviour of &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; you can specify a standard behaviour ( the files of the last session , or not ) or determine if necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the context menu , which normally appears on one click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; appears , offers further possibilities : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here you can select below different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries , as shown on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z , are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; dot ; -@@ Algorith@@ m , the standard for directed graph@@ s . it produces a hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered graph@@ s of directed graph@@ s . the algorithm re@@ produces the edges in the same direction ( from top to the right or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and possible few edge cutter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ directed graph@@ s . it produces represent@@ ations in accordance with spr@@ ing@@ board model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wai @-@ Algorith@@ m is used that equ@@ ates with statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a spr@@ int model layout for un@@ directed graph@@ s . it uses the Fru@@ it@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold @-@ He@@ ur@@ istics and includes a multi @-@ grid for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; cir@@ co ; algorithm uses the node circular according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain graph@@ s of multiple cyc@@ lical structures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command in the x@@ dot format . the command should give the graphic file as parameter , and modify the graph with a filter before it is drawn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
determines the type of the type ( directed or executed ) and is directed to the standard algorithm for each type ( dot ; for directed ; &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ directed graph@@ s ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this setting is checked , the overview is displayed if this is necessary . otherwise it will not appear and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this mouse cur@@ sor on a &amp; GUI ; element , to obtain further help with this element ( if available ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; program that uses the &amp; graphic : -@@ tools to display . it needs the following program packages :
special setup is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ ron@@ viewer ; you can find other options in the Settings menu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main window of the symbol editor is divided into five areas : the main tool@@ bar , the bar for string tools , the status bar , the .@@ color palette and the grid net in which you draw the icon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; create a new icon . if the current file is changed , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save the changes , if you want to make the icon written by a template , or whether you want to restart from scratch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rest@@ ores the last revers@@ ed step . if you don &apos;t have a step backwards , this function is de@@ activated .
includes the content of the clip@@ board as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .

reading the K@@ IP@@ I module displays tools to read and add new pictures to the new images .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this module can be used to insp@@ ect new images from external sources , and can currently be used two sources : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scan images : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the s@@ ane project , or another source such as video streams . so , you have to install K@@ oo@@ ka and s@@ ane . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you can open the menu entry pictures , you can select a dialog between all available sources on your computer . you can also select the source from which you want to get the image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears to be able to select your image according to the given default values . see the estimated file size . the estimated file size is displayed in the right , lower corner . you can find more information in K@@ oo@@ ka Manual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note that the window will be displayed completely , as some settings will not be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you have pressed the scan , you need to wait until the scan is completed and so you can specify the compression and type of the image file . in addition , you can select the compression and type of the image file . you must also choose the folder &amp; # 160 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen photos you can generate after you have selected in the menu Imp@@ or@@ tier@@ - &gt; screen photo ... selected in which you can adjust the different screen shots :
select The whole surface read off to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if all of your own program window is selected , the calling program will van@@ ish , so that you can read other screens and windows . otherwise you will read out the complete desktop window beneath your mouse only . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the delay determines how long the screen photo will wait before it starts . if you switch to other working areas , you should choose this delay high enough to navigate there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the screenshot of the screen , the dialog options of the target picture shows the options described above . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Flickr is an online photo event on the Internet . with Flickr it is possible to show people photos that are important . you can show your favorite photos of the world to show the photos of your camera &apos;s online and show your photos secure and private your family all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the module exports to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to an Flickr server on the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use the module for the first time , you will be used by the process of generating a to@@ ken . it is so quasi your password to Flickr . a browser is started to register with Flickr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the successful application , the module can send photos to the Flickr website . they will be presented following a successful login . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; simply close the browser window and return to the program . after you have pressed Yes , you get the dialog for up@@ loading photos to Flickr . this will be shown in the next section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the module exports up to Flickr for the second time , you will be welcomed with the following dialog copies . the module currently supports no other per@@ missions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the button photos should be pressed once , after you have set all the other options . using this button you can upload the photos to the Flickr server using this button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the keywords field may be filled with a separate list of words , which will be added to the image as keywords during the flood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the Op@@ tions Op@@ tions , friends and Fam@@ illi@@ e options you can set the access rights to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as a private standard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you change the option changed the size of the photos before loading , the photos will be changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the maximum size registered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the maximum size can be used to determine the maximum height of the images , and the size of the aspect is constant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module export is a tool to export your photo collection to a gallery server
currently no documentation . the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery currently has no documentation . if you are interested in this please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I teams under K@@ DE @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. please contact the mailing list : the participants of this list speak English .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization allows GPS coordinates to add , and edit the geographical data in the EX@@ IF keyword and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in a card in an external browser . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization is available to loc@@ alize images ge@@ ographic in spher@@ ical coordin@@ ate system , which is used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , long@@ itude and la@@ titude . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to cor@@ relate your pictures with ge@@ ographic data , you need a GPS track as an XML file in the GP@@ X format . G@@ PS@@ Babel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data to you from your GPS device . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
image Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choose the pictures you want to cor@@ relate to the main window and then call the menu . to see a possible correlation of time and loc@@ alization , you will have to file a Sp@@ ur@@ file with GP@@ X file to the same places as the pictures of your camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the file loaded is loaded a automatic correlation which shows the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera control must be converted to GMT time . this can be performed with the time zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the maximum devi@@ ation for the maximum time vari@@ ance is an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera control . lies the devi@@ ation , including the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not have any sp@@ ur@@ inary data for pictures , edit the GP@@ X file manually and add images to images . the time difference in 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate to the images in this area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the options Inter@@ pol@@ ishing and the difference in min. can be used if you don &apos;t have any appropriate data . if you know that in reality a location in a great difference between camera and GPS , you can put these boundaries here and then express the button cor@@ relate to the inter@@ pol@@ ishing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have a number of photos on the same location . since the dialog will use the coordinates of a call to the next , you just need to use the button OK to set the data on the current photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the location can also be found by the displayed card and to be found . in addition , select region and enlarge it . the card can always be selected manually . the card can always be selected manually between card mode , satellite picture and a mixed mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to hang up the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool is used to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this module can export your albums in a picture gallery of HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages , and the character set will be UTF @-@ 8 encoded in order to facilitate the best possible internation@@ alization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the module has four hor@@ semen to select the settings . the tab selection allows you to select all albums . in the area , you will not be able to select a large number of albums . in the area there will be a preview number of albums , which appear in the head of the HTML page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rider appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab has a page describing a page . if you click on a picture , a new page will be displayed in the image page . otherwise , the picture will be displayed directly with your standard image , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your associated images , and select a folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML Export , which contains everything , will be created there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have selected the JPEG file format , EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be saved in the new pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with other color depth , you can change the default color depth . this also influences the file size . all other settings are explan@@ atory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Rider Visu@@ als allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for the umb@@ nails , that are small images shown in the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a progress window displays the user to how far the action is . press , break down the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can automatically establish the program to preview it . the web browser will automatically end up to preview the preview of the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to look at images .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of pictures and use them basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or distortion . the viewer can be developed with short films and quick access to its functions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the start a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this module allows to save images listed below , to save images in JPEG format , without the usual losses of quality or metadata . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size is increasing , as there is no compression of the color information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera @-@ client is a tool that you can link your computer with a digital camera .
currently no documentation . the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera @-@ client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in this please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I teams under K@@ DE @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. please contact the mailing list : the participants of this list speak English .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module Metad@@ ata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the K@@ DE @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the import function of metadata mod@@ ul@@ s you can copy data from one picture to another . then select the file selection dialog with which you want to copy , so the image will be copied to the button OK . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please refer to ex@@ i@@ v2 to see which formats are supported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Encoder is a tool to convert a number of pictures into a MPEG video in the form of a Sli@@ deshow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the MPEG encoder can be used to convert selected pictures into a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert selected images to M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add an audio file to the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the Sli@@ deshow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all images are automatically selected to select the correct size for the chosen video format . in addition you can create a background color for the selected video format . with this module it is possible to burn the DVD / XV@@ CD / VCD file for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must first select the images that are packed in the MPEG Sli@@ deshow here , and then you can create the module via Extras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change the images , or the contents of the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you &apos;re happy with your list , you should select the other settings . if you are planning to set the file on a TV , you need to set the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NTSC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next step , you should indicate the time shown in seconds . the speed of the image process is specified below . a lower value creates a very sudden , very smooth change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave them black . select the name and path of the created file by name of the MPEG output file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you specify an audio file under name of the audio source file , you can simply go to the movie . depending on the speed of your computer you can drink quickly or all the rest of your computer . depending on the speed of your computer you can enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slideshow when you return . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a note seems to be missing , code or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick packages on the right button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the printer driver allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard images . this is e.g. , useful to print it or print it with the Gim@@ p module . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert images to one of three formats from JPEG , T@@ IFF or P@@ PM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w from Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : await the same results as the software from your camera actor . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , select the RA@@ W file and start the module . the grid image converter window appears in the mode for a single picture . with the button previ@@ ew@@ ing you can view the effect of your current settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can now re@@ adjust the values to the conversion process . the first option is to determine whether the camera settings can be adjusted for the White , brightness and red / blue amplifier . if the result isn &apos;t optimal , you can edit the image later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected , so that you can use contrast information if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you &apos;re happy with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses an los@@ sy algorithm and it produces the smallest file sizes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tag@@ ged Image Format , T@@ IFF , maintains all information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you often go to edit your pictures frequently or otherwise continue to use the JPEG format , since it deterior@@ ates only a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ates better . T@@ IFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep original data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you choose JPEG as memory format the metadata is stored in the RA@@ W file are stored in the JPEG file in EX@@ IF information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have adapted to your settings , you can run the conversion button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can cancel it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the batch mode allows you to convert various pictures at one time . use this mode , so if you are safe , for example by testing on a single image that are the best settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the available settings are nearly identical to the version for single pictures . however , this is useful to automatically over@@ write this file . however , this preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion will be advanced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all pictures in an album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of one album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the total number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can make the image smaller or enlarge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proportional ( 1 dim . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the picture is automatically selected , depending on the orientation orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proportional ( 2 dim . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option to adjust to your image of your screen format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not proportional : proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; printing preparation : prepare the photo for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target picture , with background size , edge size and background color , is adapted accordingly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can send chosen pictures with your favorite email program . there is also possible to change the size of the images in advance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you have launched the module , the pictures window will be displayed with you selected images . you can add more images to the button using a file selection dialog . for the last selected picture will be preview on the right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also draw pictures on the picture list , then add to the list of images added to the images below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the kno@@ b images , the selected pictures will be removed from the list of images added to the images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you selected all the pictures you can open with the button OK the New message window of your e @-@ mail clients . you only have to add the addresses and the subject , and the images selected by you are already attached . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t pay too many images at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of e @-@ mails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the email window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and each used again until you change it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use the Google Mail service , you must install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following the selection of comments in a attached file , the comments will be added to the text file and added to the mail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ NG format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to the los@@ s@@ less formats such as T@@ IFF . if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality is not changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you select JPEG image files and the original files in JPEG format are added then the original Ex@@ i@@ f@@ dates will be added to the images added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically when searching for errors , however . your e @-@ mail program will end automatically at the end . with the button , you can see this window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after starting the module advanced di@@ asch@@ au , a window with questions such as you would like to see your Sli@@ deshow here . you can select between the selected and all images of the album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Open@@ GL @-@ transi@@ tions option will use an elegant image transi@@ tions using Open@@ GL . however , you need to have appropriate graphics card as otherwise the slide show will be very slow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fil@@ en@@ ame option indicates that the file name will be displayed in the left corner , during presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the loop will ensure that the presentation will be displayed in an end loop . you can then stop it manually with Es@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the option images can be chosen randomly , that the images are displayed in random order . so it is not used the order of the images in the album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under delay between the pictures the time distance can be set between the individual images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , this should be the best before you show your friends ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more than a dozen rem@@ nant between those you can choose . randomly , select another effect from any transition between the pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the slide you can access a tool@@ bar on the top left side of the screen , move the mouse in this corner to turn it off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the Sli@@ deshow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the left side of the screen , you can see the actual file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module Time &amp; Date does not currently have documentation . if you are interested in writing these are interested please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of K@@ IP@@ I teams under K@@ DE @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. please contact the mailing list : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the work surface .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this module uses the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE working surface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you have provided your pictures and videos with comments , you can see with &amp; photo album ; see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , so in person , places and in group keywords are available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the browser window you can see the categories , for which you have entered your pictures and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to look for the folder structure on your hard disk and of course the current role models is described . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you press with the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select another person , only the images are shown on which both persons can be seen . by this selection , you can restri@@ ct the number of images shown by a few thousand pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have selected all the characters , locations and other settings , you can view images to watch the pictures of your work area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of its name . however , you can store up with a photo album ; however , for every person you can define your own photo screen ; this also applies to places , passwords , and other categories that you have defined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to view images in addition to the name , select the button which can be used separately on the tool@@ bar . please note that you can view icons for each category and simultaneously a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have a suitable image for your keyword ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , you must select which image for each individual person will be displayed . now you can select the image editor &apos;s image display . in the ren@@ dition window you can select the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and select which image of the image will be displayed and cut off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are looking for searching in the main window , you will see a dialogue that is very similar to dialogue for setting the image properties . this dialogue can be seen on the picture again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you enter a sequence in the lab@@ eling or description of the images in this text , you can also enter a date , i.e. , or the full date . you can also use a section of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using the Op@@ tions in the lower part of the window , you can browse the images by certain names , as you can see in the picture . here , where Jes@@ per is depicted , but not Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the user manual for free photo album ; if you don &apos;t like to read manu@@ als , but rather like to try functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
go to the homepage of &amp; no photo album ; and take a look at the screening , the screen@@ shots and the introduction videos .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start recording &amp; photo album ; and select a photo album at the first dialog , or select a photo album at the menu for the first time , or select the function of photo album at the menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; no photo album ; as a related HTML document to download . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the bottom edge of the main window of &amp; c@@ photo album ; see the timet@@ able . a picture of this paste can be seen here : . as the name says it shows you date statistics about the images in your database .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each paste becomes a different unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the time bar can be inter@@ actively used in the following ways : you can preview the displayed entries preview from the database ( when you select a date ) and the time bar displays the current date of the currently displayed images , when you navigate in the preview view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also select a range of time bar by clicking the mouse button and select the mouse on the ruler of the time bar , so you can select the selection , by clicking on a bar in the time bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo album ; present two ways to create HTML @-@ websites with your images . one is integrated in &amp; in photo album ; built in the following part of the user manual ; built in &amp; in a photo album which you can create on the HTML file ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before HTML page , you will need to make some settings . these are divided into three areas of content , layout and finish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first give you the title of the review and a description , which should contain the HTML file later . on photo@@ album ; for example , see an example of these settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next , choose whether a photo album is created ; the export file is to be displayed on the page . noc@@ tur@@ nal information about export files you can find in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; la@@ stly , you can select which information can be displayed on the HTML page . for example , you can see that information is displayed without a description . for example , you can &apos;t use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this section , you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most adjustment options are unique , which is why it has not been specifically received . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; below on the page you can set various resolutions for the pictures , which supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , which have no images for example download a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the viewer from your site can change the resolution at any time , so that it is able to browse your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transfer time . if he considers a picture bigger , it changes to higher resolution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this setting field , place the various folders and the URL , where your website is stored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; best , select a Base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , you must select the main folder where all your pictures will be saved . this folder can be saved automatically for all future images . here you can select either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you have created your pictures , you can check if these really are all for viewer . if you select the URL for the Base folder , the URL should be set . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not yet need to copy the files created by you in the final destination folder , see , right , you will need to specify the final aim of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all three of the programs described were based on basic folder or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder , whose name you can specify in output folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , one conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; photo album , you may want to add a HTML page to view images , reception site , etc . , you do not have to do so with photo album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with photo album , you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import another into your database . image properties are imported and imported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in it if the images can be saved in the file or if you have all the pictures in the file . the obvious draw@@ back is the file size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu file ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file is looking for the images in a double way . if you are not found in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file , this is only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following , the dialog for export of pictures described you can export on the File Export menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most important option of this dialogue is whether it should be an internal or external .@@ k@@ im file . the following three selection options are available :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select Manual in the .@@ k@@ im file , you will need to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the automatic option to copy the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; photo album , the images automatically for you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; .@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most pictures have been compressed already with JPEG . if you want to comp@@ ress the XML file even so , simply select the files to comp@@ ress the export file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last option of this page is maximum picture size limit . if you send your friends pictures maybe not in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would be very large , as you can say the size is 800 pixels high and wide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to import a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file , import and photo album ; the exported database as described in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the wiz@@ ard for import@@ ing consists of four steps . first you have to select which images you want to import , in which folders that import images should be copied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may be that you are called the category persons to be imported file , while this category is called for your database . therefore , you will be imported into the third dialogue window which may be imported into your database and what categories they are present in your database . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the fourth step , you can purchase the categories of import@@ ing file with the categories of your current database . one example will see you on the image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must be easy to browse images and watch : if you look at pictures , you want to see pictures of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this manual , you will find the various steps from ( 1 ) determine information about your images , through ( 2 ) through searching and viewing , through ( 3 ) advanced topics and adjustment possibilities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album started as a program to manage your pictures . however , it has been expanded and today it takes care of your videos . in many places in this hand@@ book it will talk about pictures , but often it also closes videos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; photo album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of their images . this is a simple XML file , which you can backup on a dis@@ kette or revisions in the CVS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; photo album ; notice the folder where your pictures are stored and used this in future Star@@ ts . if you want to start a different file tree with images here . if you want to start a different file tree with images here . as an example : photo album -@@ c ~ / company / Pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to set up a photo album , you can set up a window with which you can change the settings of photo album ; you can change the different adjustment possibilities in the following section of the user name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can invo@@ ke the preview options and options for the viewer . for each setting you can call on the F1 key and click on the required option . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was described in you as you can define various properties , e.g. persons , places and keywords in each image . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on watch the dialog , which is used to process already existing groups . you can select a label for each existing group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the section , sub categories were already mentioned . in the dialog box , you can set up complete members of members , e.g. all members of a group at once in a group than in explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the setting options available to you , you can select the category . with the top listed selection list you can configure the category and list the list of sub@@ categories in the left . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; photo album ; shares his modular system with other graphic applications such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and G@@ wen@@ view . image plug@@ in interface is called K@@ IP@@ I and K@@ DE ; image plug interface . contact information on the P@@ pi website .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the modules can be called via the menu modules . these modules can not be described in this manual , because they are not part of &amp; no photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page you can call about the modules themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the modules have been used together for several applications together , it can be used to call new modules first with the command &gt; &apos; photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &apos; or via the menu Help . say , don &apos;t have warned you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , making it possible to work some modules with &amp; no photo album ; it is the draw@@ back when you share functions with different applications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest difference between &amp; c@@ photo album ; and other applications that K@@ IP@@ I use it is an album simply not supported , simul@@ ates it for some modules , simul@@ ates the order of albums , so that you can use the functions with &amp; photo album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; simul@@ ates &amp; c@@ photo album ; the current album , which corresponds to the current view , so all images that show you the picture show at the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the current album , &amp; no photo album , the modules also has a list of albums . here &apos;s a photo album , as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if photo album &apos;s browser shows the content of a category such as all persons , then each entry of this category is an album for the module . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or it will be the category which you have set in the setup dialog as category for virtual albums , so if you would like to have selected a photo album , so if you would have selected persons to view and the module this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since some modules with a photo album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules and select the setup dialog and select the modules that are loaded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the picture you can see an example of a start screen , as soon as you start photo album , with your own pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you can get it from any other K@@ DE application , you can see the window with which you have entered your image database . currently , we will not show you information about your images , but then click on the picture to show you an overview with all existing images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the main features of photo album ; is the ability to see each picture with notes , where the picture has been added , so you can bet every picture individually or for a larger number of images that is illustrated by all images in Copenhagen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all these notes can be used for searching and brow@@ sing , as you can read in the section . if you want to see these notes when you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view , see three lists with a text box by typ@@ ing persons , places and keyword . these are a very important part of &amp; photo album , as you can always use them back to your pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following idea is due to loc@@ ating the pictures within the list : if you are depicted on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , so you can find the names used upwards and assign them faster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you prefer to see an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon of sorting after date under the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have chosen notes separately for each image , you may want to edit all selected images and click on those pictures with notes . in this case , click on the preview and back buttons that are located under the preview of the picture right above . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and select the menu item multiple entries at once with a note . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as a super@@ group . to show you that it is a super@@ group , a special symbol is displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the context menu of note dial@@ ogs it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also draw one entry into a category and locate it in order to alphabe@@ tically arrange your categories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move the individual elements of note dial@@ ogs , click and move the upper edge of the frame , click and move the upper edge of the frame by moving it outside of the window area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you have adapted the look of the window to your needs , click the button options to save you with the options below ... that gives you the actual structure and the look of the window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can get a frame also completely . if you want to see this window again later , use the button options ... and then click on the window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select the entry pictures in the browser you will find an overview of the preview images , or all images in case you have no filter here . you can configure the size of the preview images through simple following drag the mouse with the middle mouse button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this picture is set as a background image for your desktop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you click on a picture , this image viewer is displayed . if you have not opened a window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also delete pictures in the image preview , simply select the appropriate pictures you want to delete and press in the menu Edit menu . now you can see the window that you can see in the picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this problem , you can also use a solution for this problem . in the picture you can also use your photo album by clicking on the hard disk . in the picture you can see the view from &amp; no photo album ; if not all required pictures of the hard disk can be saved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images , where the right upper corner is cut off , are not displayed on the hard disk . for example , the preview images can be displayed on the pictures 1 @-@ 9 . however , the preview of these pictures can be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you see this function you need to copy files from the folders and to your photo album . so , if you do not want to ask you to get a larger hard drive to save all the pictures you want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the menu images you will find a sub@@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to remain a little more privacy if you want to see the pictures you want to see and click the menu click everything except the current view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this you have defined images to be hidden in the case of the thread . if you want to lock the menu with your little sister , then select all the images that you have locked , please click on lock up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also possible to specify a password , which must be entered for unlock the images . to set this password , select a password in the menu privacy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please remember that this image protection is not very safe . for example , you can read or delete all images on the disk and to the other one can only read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only very familiar with the view to private images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason why you are all your pictures with &amp; photo album ; manage and set hours over hours with it , of course you want to consider them at some point . this is a preview of How to start , as described in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it shows the viewer you can see in . it shows the image , but additional information you can enter the image , such as who is in the image , when and where was it done , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to see the Info@@ Box on the upper part of the picture , you can also configure which information is displayed and what information is displayed . all these options are displayed on the viewer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click here , the browser will display all images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had chosen people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have multiple pictures loaded in the viewer , you can jump between them and return . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can be reached from the context menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if several pictures are loaded in the viewer you can run it as a slide show . then you can press a new image after a few seconds . as often as a new image invites you to press the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or minus you will be stopped and stopped by the key C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful skill of the viewer &apos;s photo album ; can be changed in full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete place on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full@@ screen mode and back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you use the viewer , you can drag the zoom into the image and zoom out . with the mouse button you can drag the Plus button in the middle of the picture and shows the result of zo@@ oms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the picture is not shown zo@@ omed , so every pixel on screen image is identical to a pixel image of the picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note that the only zo@@ om@@ operations work on videos , that it comes in and zoom out with the Plus@@ and Min@@ u@@ sta@@ ste . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the script functions from the context menu , you can rot@@ ate the image . this does not work with videos . you can comment on the current image with menu item from the context menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you look at images , you can find a picture with a person whose name you can forget to take on the picture . at the moment , you can check the image and see the configuration dialog of the picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to see the pictures on paper and watch them as good or po@@ or@@ ly , while you can watch one by one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to watch images with tra@@ its . features are the letters A to Z and you can make a feature that you have the corresponding letter . in view , see a picture where the features A , B and C are set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you have set features on your pictures , you can see them in your browser . so you can see all the pictures you want , print or whatever you want to edit . this is described in order to copy the selected pictures on a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; categories and special features can be displayed in the view view . if you can view these categories in D@@ re Pre@@ view , you can simply press the letters for the characters when the picture was selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case , you are allowed to make photo album , on the image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the painted system is not stored with the image , but in the database . you can und@@ o your mind later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the picture , you can see a picture on the painted image . in order to exit the painting from the pop@@ up menu on the painting you simply select the cross in the tool@@ bar top at the top . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you must not fully rule the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , but you should have read and understood the documentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the object tree you can select individual objects . then , their properties are displayed in the object properties and display the object in the wire views yellow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already chosen object , as all sub @-@ objects are already selected with the object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and select either the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is there any possible positions , the following entry menu will be inserted , so that you can choose the right position : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Del@@ ete or from the menu bar , select selected objects from the scene you can remove selected objects from the scene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you enter the Path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; User documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object using help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 includes the documentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you process a texture or a part of a texture , you can view a preview of the Picture View . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a preview of the texture display and a small example of the scene will be removed with the chosen texture . if you want to select a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map , please tick local texture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the screen photo shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these check@@ points with the mouse button , thereby changing the position and direction of the camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a transformation is selected , the control points and it will appear a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the shift by pulling with the mouse within the entire window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each object has a V@@ isi@@ bility level . you can specify this value relatively to the level of the superior object , or as absolute value . objects will only be displayed if they are selected or equal to the scene selected in the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window order as pre@@ set . the object tree and view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window system or if you need a different arrangement , you can save them as well . you can also save multiple windows assign@@ ments and easily change between different arrangements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to anch@@ oring a window through or below a view , pull the instructions on top or lower edge of a view . a rect@@ angle indicates the new position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create a new column , pull the instructions on the right or left side of a view . the new view is mounted on the right or left side of this view and extends over the whole height . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to arrange several views on each other , drag the f@@ ow@@ asser in the middle to another view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the views above in the views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last possible windows of window are floating views : views that are not ancho@@ red in the main window . to draw a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the instructions on the desktop or click on the little arrow pointing to the left button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the facade bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can insert additional views to the main window . in the menu view , you can find entries for any kind of view . new views are sh@@ web@@ end , you can anch@@ oring it to any place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current window view can save you with view window order ... Save . it will be a dialog , where you can save the window rules under an existing or new name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have created a scene you can ren@@ ew it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ ders ; this program has to be installed correctly . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ren@@ ew the current scene , click on the symbol Ren@@ ders The symbol Ren@@ ders in the tool@@ bar or select the menu item view scene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and the quality of the ren@@ ders . if you want to insert a scene in different sizes and quality levels . you can insert any number of R@@ ender @-@ modes with a fast preview of up to full pictures of the highest quality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you click on the icon The R@@ ender Settings icon or in the View menu View ... , the following dialogue will be opened : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it is a name to recognize the features of the mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the card @-@ card size you can enter the width and height of the picture below , select the section section and specify the picture cut to the input fields . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in combination with quality , you can select the properties that are used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for ren@@ ders . this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user refle@@ x lighting . a detailed description of the R@@ ender relationships can be found in the user dictionary to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a picture comes with just one ray per pixel , various errors may occur . these images are often not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called Ali@@ asing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors , generally speaking pictures with this property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you turn anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as a standard feature a adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is always divided and adap@@ tively because the recur@@ sion@@ ing depth depends on the calculated colour values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a stra@@ hl . if you set the difference between colour values of pixels using super sampling , then a grid of 4x4 additional points will be charged with a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixels , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixels . the difference is then : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 @-@ b 2 )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the colour values exceed the prescribed threshold , then the pixels in 4 sub@@ pixel will be followed by individually and further sub@@ division . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process , called J@@ enn@@ ing . when you switch j@@ itter@@ ing , changed the rays to avoid regular patterns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the final setting for the quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this capacity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this card , you can set up whether the alpha channels are to be calculated using POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated rays have no object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene import , select the menu entry file import ... and select a file in the dialog window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not the full command set of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings will show a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ w@@ end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , simply select the source code in the editor . simply select the source code in the editor and drag him into the object tree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
copying and paste in &amp; paste in your editor you can include source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ;
the POV @-@ Ray command is called upon when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; one scene is running . usually this is P@@ ov@@ ray or x @-@ P@@ ov@@ ray .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click on the Help menu , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . here you will find the path to your doc@@ umen@@ ical and the version . it will support versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example , foot@@ notes ) into the paths to the P@@ ov@@ ray ; you may also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first used file is used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the color for the wire models . the second color is used for display of selected objects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the color for check@@ points . the second color will be used for displaying the selected check@@ points .
the color of the rack for viewing in the camera view and in the window @-@ type label .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can set the object @-@ cat@@ cher to the grid in the context menu of the wire @-@ model views . here you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; greater values give a more accurate wire and a better version for the displayed objects , but require more time to ren@@ ders . for some objects such as the ball can be set up separately for two directions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you tick the high @-@ detail path@@ ways to extended projec@@ tions , all the wire @-@ model views are used . extended projec@@ tions are all projec@@ tions with exceptions of perspective and vertical projec@@ tions . this feature produces a better approach for projec@@ tions , but requires more time to ren@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you cross the wall , a wall behind the objects becomes rounded . the wall is shown in a cart@@ on pattern of two adjustable colours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you tick the floor below , a floor below the objects is rounded , the floor is shown in a cart@@ on pattern of two adjustable colours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you tick the edge of can@@ opy , the non @-@ recur@@ sive Anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for the rendering of scenes . the values for depth and swelling can be adjusted . in more detail about the parameters you will find in the Section R@@ ender @-@ modes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this page , you can rev@@ ise an existing window order or create new window lists . in the section window en@@ das , you can create and save window en@@ das . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Combin@@ ation field of standard windows : shows all existing window lists . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window order starting at the start of the program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list Ex@@ posed Temp@@ or@@ das lists all existing window orders . a new arrangement can be created with the button and delete a selected arrangement with the button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
each window is identified by name . the name must be un@@ equi@@ vocal and must not be empty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list below the name displays all views of the selected window order . new views can create and selected views with the button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new column &apos;s position . with new column , you create a new column on the right side of the existing windows , with card card and the view is not ancho@@ red in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so you just have &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you would like to follow without more specific knowledge of the two programs . if you can create the ultimate but simple scene under beginners : a ball on a level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but you should notice the following war@@ nings , before you make sure you use a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D programme for the first time you should consider these important rules : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not adjust the camera , no rules can be applied to rendering , as a result you will receive a black image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paste no light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you &apos;ll get only a black image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have installed everything wrong you see at the first start by &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following default window order is :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation , so that you can expect an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er , starting with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first select all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select a scene without objects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wire @-@ model view shows how the camera is watching the whole scene you create . in particular you can see the scene from the view of the camera . this shows the results of the scene of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new record with the name camera . when it click on it to find the content of the view object properties in which the various parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; find more details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change nothing to the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera in view points can change , with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click on the left mouse button and drag him to the desired place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you press the button on users or the input button , the wire @-@ model views and the object tree changes immediately according to these settings . as a result they see the scene from the perspective of camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are many ways to create the bottom for the scene . you could set for example a qu@@ ader ( insert ) and size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is an in@@ comprehen@@ sible method to solve this task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; co@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; indeed offers a simpler option . you can use an infinite plane as the ground :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good advice : select the plain in the object tree , change the name and then press the button on users or the input button . the new name is displayed immediately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the wire @-@ model view also displays the level , even at the moment only as a finite level . if you ren@@ ew the scene , the plane extends down to the horizon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you look at the object tree , you will find that you can click on the different parameters of the object . in this case you can see the different parameters of the object . in this case you can see one of these options , change the possible settings in the list of object properties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this scene you should move the ground to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just to gain some of these parameters . choose Dis@@ placement and set the values as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first select the ground to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose a moment in a moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both cases , a dialog will open in which you can select as the object will be inserted . please select the name in the window view ( name = soil pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview it looks like the pig@@ ment now looks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the preview of the pig@@ ment is just a matte black material because you can still use settings for the pig@@ ment . now there are plenty of options for the pig@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you don &apos;t see any color on qu@@ ader and ball in the preview , click on the button to preview and then call the preview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the material for the floor is right now . if you ren@@ ew your image with a click on the icon , you should receive the following result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course this is not the color you have expected . in the color list you need to do two new attributes . then select this entry twice as well . then select this entry twice ( you can also do this in more common but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
please choose in the object tree jed@@ es@@ times and change the colors in view of object properties :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this step should you be easy to run , as you should have understood the basic mode of work by &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; just as simple as the ground can be created : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the list of object properties , you can instantly change the settings . put the ball in contact with the ground . otherwise the ball would float above the ground , since you moved the ground around one unit down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the rendering now gives a strange result : as already seen before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . put a suitable material in the following step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already at the bottom , give the ball a pig@@ ment as color : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choose ear@@ piece and change the name for example in sphere pig@@ ment . click on the pig@@ ment , then select In@@ cen@@ tive and set the values as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you can reach more interesting effects if you take time to adjust some finish properties :
then change the values as in the following screen shots and click on or press the input button .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brightness effect and reflection provide some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal is not selected : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you should now have a good impression that offers you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er , and hopefully you have lear@@ nt so much to create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender Method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you take a scene ra@@ y@@ line , the rendering hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera used ) through any pixels in the scene and how atmospheric effects will affect the visual effect . so the scene pixel is processed for pixels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you can imagine , you will not see the scene with which you see the scene . without a light source you can see the scene . without a light source you need to see the scene , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
opens a file . in the standard file dialog you can select a file that you have previously made with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and will replace the oldest entry in the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have you already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
introduces the scene stored in the last saved version . all changes have been rejected since the last storage .
this menu entry allows you to select only if you don &apos;t have stored changes in the scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; repeat the last revers@@ ed command . this menu entry allows you to select only if you have used editing files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
stores the current window order and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this menu , you will find options for the setting of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , the ke@@ yp@@ ad and the default behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change default commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er using this option .
open a dialog to set up tool bar . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er using this option .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a dump map is a way to make rough surfaces , without having to be model@@ ed on the surface without changing the geomet@@ ric form of the object themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for a dump map as well as for a texture map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basic bodies are simple geomet@@ ric shapes , which you can use as chips : very complex 3D models will be generated from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models will then continue to give them a more realistic appearance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on a pixel base , by applying an image file as a color card . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser where you can select images to display .
images can be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can display with Click &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the return Return .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can set , whether any image will be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always be used the same window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this setting defines where the images can be saved without a file name . if the images are stored after each scan , the default is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this parameter defines a pre@@ fix for the image to save images , and is beyond the proposed name for the image in the dialog . this automatically saved a num@@ eric ad@@ diction of each image . the string # # # will be replaced by the numbers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the user can adapt the image quality to save image quality . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value is used by Q@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

you may need to set up existing multimedia keys so that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in doing so you can make your keyboard for the Amar@@ o@@ ok ; -@@ Control Centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface from Amar@@ o@@ ok has many general functions to be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section is made of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P function of collection , context browser , playlist , playlist , playlist browser and scripts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Amar@@ o@@ ok supports command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE ; in addition Amar@@ o@@ ok has some own command line options .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be carried out because of a missing case , and use dialog , so that the user does not run a script . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Beg@@ in require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos;s Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ binding v@@ 3.4 is RE@@ QU@@ I@@ RED for this script . &apos; &apos; dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the folder scripts / templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . they can be used as a base for your own scripts , or simply discover that writing of scripts is relatively simple . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , you can exchange your scripts with Amar@@ o@@ ok and Amar@@ o@@ c . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; , which should be attached to every K@@ DE installation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most scripts themselves allow run external programs and commands . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; is usually called d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively simple . here &apos;s an example in Python : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all current scripts . for this reason , scripts can monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script may ignore the events if there is no use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
configure points the script to display the setup dialog . to save the setup data you need to take care of each script . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the work@@ folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; track@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is played . the script could now query more information about the new piece ( for example , metadata or the piece length ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
volum@@ et@@ Change new@@ volume sign@@ alis@@ es a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ ary Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu sub@@ title : Con@@ tains the path to the selected files of the playlist . sub@@ menu sub@@ menu . sub@@ menu and it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le can also be used to add an entry to the selected entry . to add an entry to d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ o@@ script Mo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ em ( sub@@ menu item ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before &amp; Amar@@ o@@ c ; stop , or when the user stop a script , send &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal should be processed , for example , to get ready to do . this is e.g. storing data or configuration settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install the script packages that can be compressed to the user &amp; z@@ b . such packages can be compressed as usual using b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) that the user can clearly detect the archive as Amar@@ o@@ c script package .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; 1.3 will accept only script packages from an enlarged amar@@ oc@@ script . for this reason you should name your script packages right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , which should not be exec@@ utable . use the t@@ ar parameter p to get the file rights : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when your script package is finished , you can go up to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wik@@ i scripts page by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; K@@ DE ; . &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features , but is surprisingly easy to use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; you can simply go through music into the playlist instead , instead of using endless menus . maybe you can also search for a quite certain titles from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; &apos;s collecting browser and the quick search will find the piece within seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps you already have some play@@ lists that you would like to hear , but then the play@@ lists is just the right thing for you . and if you decide to decide your decision , the dynamic mode and smart play@@ lists will automatically choose the right music after certain criteria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Amar@@ o@@ ok has an outstanding support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many generic USB devices . you can also look for many different audio systems . Amar@@ o@@ c is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to experience your music !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually , one must type in the basic folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to comp@@ ile Amar@@ o@@ ok , and install : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should have pre@@ compiled no difficulties . if you encounter problems , please tell you in the &amp; K@@ DE ; mail@@ ing@@ lists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; has like most applications a few options to activate or disable the comp@@ iling point in the configure script or disable it . this is a list of available options .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for some of the comp@@ iling options certain depen@@ dencies need to be fulfilled , so that they can be used in the section system requirements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
activ@@ ates de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you would like to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ o ; you should have to use full .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; can be set up without effort via the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several winding cards to set up the different functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will show the player window in addition to the playlist . if the option is off , only the playlist window will be shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar , the experimental feature switches the experimental feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

file copying files for the music files : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . otherwise the .@@ mood files will be stored on the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise the .@@ mood files will be stored in the settings file of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / cookies / m@@ ood@@ bar / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; external browser : lets you choose which browser from &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; should be started when a browser is needed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other browser use : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not located in the list below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; playlist when storing , the current playlist automatically saves the current playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and activate this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist when closing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , use &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files will be saved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current piece shows that the playlist window appears , that the playlist window is open / off , in order to keep the current piece always in the visible window area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar interpre@@ ts : after activation of this setting , &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters to the same piece may be called . note : you need not load the list in context @-@ browser to use this function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . further information can be found in summary of the functions and gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ o@@ ok needs only the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need k@@ deli@@ bs installed so ( including the programs included ) . we have written a small guide how to comp@@ ile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some functions such as the O@@ SD is predic@@ ting that your window manager will work the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org , so we try to prepare Amar@@ o@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because they provide an excellent development environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; probably , one of your files will make a mistake in the tag@@ Li@@ b library . you can also delete the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / tablet / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . afterwards , you can delete the file and release the file again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mostly , it is important that Tag@@ lib before reading the met@@ a @-@ info from this file crashing . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is a bit more mature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ensure that all libraries were compiled with the same comp@@ iler . if , B. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , tag@@ Li@@ b , but with GCC 3.@@ 3.x , this leads to crash when editing the met@@ a @-@ information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use K@@ DE using art@@ s@@ d , then disable machines when in@@ active for ... to setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also send us your back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail doesn &apos;t open at a crash ) and send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be guaranteed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is because many program will write data as UTF @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ info , but this does not fix as Unicode . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
# ! / us@@ r / bin / per@@ l who does not exist &quot; -@@ f $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use $ v@@ 2@@ tag &#91; 0 &#93; &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag &#91; 0 &#93; &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag &#91; 0 &#93; \ &apos; s $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be re @-@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; see symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repeti@@ tion / Dynamic playlist ) . this is a known error in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects will be forgotten in gray and semi @-@ transparent . please note that in some cases you can click on a symbol until it shows its effect .
if you get this error : icon L@@ ook@@ up error : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pixel : un@@ defined symbol _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pixel . this can be repeated with ld@@ d &apos;@@ Which cat@@ amar@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ zed q@@ t version or modify / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ o@@ ok finds the right version first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are some possibilities . most installation problems clari@@ fy yourself at ligh@@ test by means of an expert your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also use the forum and the IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ o@@ fre@@ en@@ .net . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to search for help . please enter there only a bug if something is located at the correction of an error in Amar@@ o@@ k itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; only a blank playlist will appear . how do the pieces come across there ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is easy . use the file browser on the left , and open the desired folder . then drag the files into the right part of the playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to keep the surface intuitive , the start @-@ window is converted into the statisti@@ c window . you will find it under ex@@ tras statistics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the importance of these icons has changed with Amar@@ o@@ c 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the rating through the user , while the points are calculated automatically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to evaluate pieces , must be displayed in the playlist . click on the title icon of the playlist and select column . this will also work when Amar@@ o@@ ok is in the background . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the files you want to remove , and then press your mouse on your keyboard . or click the right mouse button to select your selection and then select from playlist menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draw a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and let it fall there , just as you would like to do it with other files . that &apos;s how simple it is : - ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , next to the Add @-@ button , you can save the button playlist . click on it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
probably l@@ acks the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config . install the package X@@ M@@ MS @-@ dev@@ el and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ c ; this package contains many very nice visu@@ alis@@ ations .
the equ@@ alizer is located in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it via the menu bar under ex@@ tras ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no . yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; use one of the back@@ end independent approach , so the real question must support G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / N@@ MM / MAS / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm . as you can see even text and P@@ NG ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it may ! maybe you can use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which in the default does not use MP3 Decoder ( for pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 K@@ DE , input bar
launch the Y@@ ast Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you are using the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink device you need to use a bl@@ ender . a mixer provides several applications to use the device for the same time and can be used simultaneously by a sound card with the hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of this command should help you in search of the problem , and help a solution . you may need to give another S@@ ink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ sink ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t forget that media must first be de@@ coded . you can &apos;t simply listen to the media first . you can only hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is reading the file , de@@ coded them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open the Control Centre Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . activate Sound@@ server with highest priority ( real time pri@@ ori@@ ity ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( see the next point of the FAQ ! ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia code@@ cs which can cause performing playback . read this error account in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either you do not use the Arts driver but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to obtain the faster Arts code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver was strongly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts buffer in the Control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . yes , this is a bug , please help us fix it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed but when I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , cras@@ hes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; off . why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all the components . register G@@ ST register to register all the G@@ Stre@@ amer components . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # g@@ asp@@ berry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try this ( finish Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Up@@ load g@@ m@@ peg file , comp@@ ile and install it . then delete the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer ( config ) and run G@@ ST register again . start now &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please tell it under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. if you have a whole list of proposals / wishes , send them best to our mailing list : Amar@@ o@@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very and find that the name sounds good . furthermore the name contains the magical ... : )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . put an alarm in your calendar program and leave you with the alarm to execute this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; run playback . make sure you go to bed , then you will be wo@@ ken up by the gentle beaches of the music that you have stopped before going to bed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how to learn the currently in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ c ; current title if one is on another computer ?
if a functioning of SSH environment is present you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpretation and titles of the current piece : ssh -@@ I ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ RSA / id _ RSA @-@ re@@ usable Amar@@ o@@ player now@@ w Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and I@@ hr@@ us@@ ername with your us@@ ername . this requires your identification in the file ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ RSA is present .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ o@@ c . press down on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer , in an independent , in the size adjustable window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the combination of Str@@ g + Rights Mau@@ sta@@ ste sets a piece in the queu@@ e sequence in the queu@@ e . by pushing the input button , the first search result is played and the search returns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ ck@@ wise functions , but how does it look like the icon in the system section of the Control bar ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; click on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browser will be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ o@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and there are many error messages on the console . what now ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you have to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok on a local drive , or use am@@ aro@@ K@@ s MySQL support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the CD , then click on the Audio CD . for normal read , select a few pieces and drag them into the desired destination folder in a kon@@ quer@@ or window . instead , use folders from folders mp3 or og@@ g . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List Val@@ ues = query ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , &quot; F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HERE R@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( E@@ scap@@ e@@ String ) ) ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically , this fits the previous assessment with a decreasing value based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence has the overall score . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can edit the rating for one piece yourself , by clicking on the right mouse button on a column of column in the playlist window . then you can select the rating of a piece in the playlist by clicking or press F2 . you can also edit reviews in the dialog metadata . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok , this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan that will not be combined with the short term planned plan of Amar@@ ok . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a new function in Amar@@ o@@ ok , but some users may well also find annoying . de@@ activate the option symbol for playing animated in general settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Analy@@ zer is part of tool@@ bar . select tool@@ bars , and take the desired changes there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; download a design , or create your own . install this then set up under Amar@@ ok ... look out to new design context @-@ browser design , click to create new design .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the symbol was similar to War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid problems , it was removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Con@@ quer@@ or brow@@ sing section , you will run kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to show the navigation area . then click on button settings ( the top ) and select Amar@@ o@@ ok button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
audio @-@ seals is a free service to be sent to the information given by an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free user name and a password . audio @-@ seals is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ o@@ c ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to use AL@@ SA , then please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of ab@@ ap@@ ron and thus also causes a lot of error reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
probably &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; compiled before you have not compiled these output modules . so you have to configure it . / configure routine does not comp@@ ile this output modules . you need to configure and install Amar@@ o@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re @-@ installed , but the output modules still appear not yet . and now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; probably you use a distribution file installed from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the same applies to x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ dev@@ el . after that you have to re@@ comp@@ ile and install Amar@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ Cri@@ tical * * : factory for &apos; ad@@ der &apos;@@ has no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer is compiled with pre @-@ linking system . you have to comp@@ ile G@@ Stre@@ amer without pre@@ linking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ TC : uses no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS when you comp@@ ile Amar@@ ok .
I get the error message there is no element present @-@ to handle the file &apos; s mim@@ ic au@@ dia / mp@@ 4 though the module g@@ asp@@ ing @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play mp@@ 4 or M4@@ A files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , it must also be installed g@@ asp@@ ing @-@ quick@@ time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will receive the error there is no element present @-@ to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you play a MP3 stream , but the module g@@ asp@@ ing @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and run then as a system administrator G@@ ST register . then you restart Amar@@ o@@ ok . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use Amar@@ ok the second sound card ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under Settings Amar@@ o@@ ok ... Audio output enter the device . typically , B. HW @-@ 0 for the standard sound@@ card and the HW @-@ 1 for the second . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here you can see an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with a onboard AC@@ 97 code@@ c and a USB Audio device :
p@@ c@@ m.@@ intel@@ x 0 { type plug @-@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; HW : 0 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ intel@@ le@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; HW : 1 &quot; } ct@@ ed@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; HW : 1 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type HW card 1 }
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter the setup dialog of x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion rate , channels and so on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the tick on the sound card supports m@@ map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sorry , but the audio output with Arts will not be taken care of . you may naturally enjoy this problem yourself into the hand ! if you want , you can get the new so urg@@ ently needed care for Arts : ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is no help when you want to update your collection , or not like the assist@@ ants to be updated . with their help you will be set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in a few minutes you &apos;ll have set up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; creating a playlist is very simple . select with the mouse entries from the collector &apos;s browser , so you can save the search for certain pieces . so you can save it with the playlist . you will find this button in the tool@@ box of the playlist window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add these play@@ lists to the playlist by the playlist . if the playlist will be enabled in the folder of your collection , you will find various ways to be loaded with a right click on a playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to play an audio CD , select a file browser with multiple folders and CD recordings in WAV format . drag the WAV files to the playlist and press the button playback . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audio CD @-@ function uses the audi@@ oc@@ d protocol : / or is not compatible with all available drivers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the burning function is also available in the playlist . just click on the right mouse button on one entry , and follow the burning menu . you have various ways to burn a CD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; the installation of some software packages predic@@ ts . the required packages are listed below . additionally some additional packages are listed that make work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; make more pleasant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you install these pack@@ ets of a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you will need to install the development versions of these packages ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers lots of different ways to keep your music collection under control . however , a playlist window with the most important functions . the play@@ lists window contains several browsers to capture and browse your entire music collection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this chapter , explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; used to create a collection and a playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the player window is a one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control centre . at the top edge of the window is a running text indicator that returns the current sequence , bit@@ rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current piece . a click on this page changes the remaining play time for the remaining play time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the player window displays a selection of audio analy@@ zers , including the running text display . you can switch from the available analy@@ zer by clicking the mouse button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; Amar@@ o@@ c ; -@@ Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer , displayed in an independent , enlarged window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; below the running text display the buttons PL and E@@ Q . the button PL is activated or de@@ activ@@ ates the playlist window , while the button E@@ Q is used to set the owner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the piece of position sliding . use the sliding buttons to start playing / stop the playback and switch to the next or previous piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of the built @-@ in Equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pre@@ ferences , from Classical to Techno , and you can easily create your own pre@@ ferences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to view the equ@@ alizer , select Extras Equalizer from the Main Menu or Click the button E@@ Q in the player window . once you select the analog button equ@@ alizer , the equ@@ alizer is in operation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So@@ x : a program that can convert between different audio formats , and convert . So@@ x is used by the So@@ x Audio encoder module . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ CD@@ Ima@@ ger : a full @-@ equipped car system for editing , dis@@ assemb@@ ling and analy@@ zing video CDs and super @-@ video CDs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nor@@ mali@@ ze : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level , for example , to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections , the different record level can lead to the invisible effect that the music pieces can be re@@ produced differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to be able to boot from CD and automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a convenient method , recently re@@ opened projects . the associated sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on one entry brings the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stores the current project . if the project has been saved once , the file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stores the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save will appear , with which you can select folders and file name for the project file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
stores all open projects . that &apos;s the same as you would like to save for each individual project file .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conclu@@ des the current project . if a project has changed and not stored , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after what will happen . you can then drop off the closing time and keep the project so open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
includes all opened projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for every stored project so that it should happen as if you had called for each project file .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; includes all opened projects and finished &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for every stored project will be asked , so as if you had called a file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you visit this entry , you can select the same effect when you set the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens the &quot; burning &quot; for the current project . the only difference is the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for burning the media , it can only open when the project already contains data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many projec@@ t@@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described above ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry is used only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it is useful when you get files from a previous meeting in the current project . it is useful for you to see files for a multi @-@ professional recording CD . it is more useful for you to see files and folders using the media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this entry is only released on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this feature does not extract files from the current project . this function removes no files from the media , it only ends the previously imported files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the CD copying dialog . this enables you to copy the copy of a CD to another medium . furthermore , you can also choose to copy cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens the DVD copying dialog . this enables you to create a copy of a DVD to another medium . furthermore , you can also use a copy of a DVD to another medium . furthermore , the target medium must be large enough to include the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW , so that you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
opens the dialog for the format of a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) which makes the content completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ ment@@ ell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; burn a previously er@@ ated CD image . the dialog will ask you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ spare or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source which then immediately will not be supported by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported ) , so you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a previously built DVD image , the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso file as a source of data , which then fired by pressing the burning button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a previously trained DVD video can be converted . thereby , this dialogue window will usually be used following the read out of a DVD in the contents , but can also be all@@ ready to change the size and cut black edges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shows information about the covered medium . these information are displayed in the contents , include characteristics of the media , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
displays a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this is crossed , a small glue is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; switches the folder view or out . the folder view includes an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . in case the contents will be displayed . CD / DVD drives have also a context menu with functions such as media info , locking and unlock the drive or dis@@ card of the media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; switches the ingredients preview or from . the ingredients preview can also select the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a drive is selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; switches the head strip in the project view or out . the top bar is a narrow@@ er area , which is only visible when the project view includes open projects , and separates the project view clearly from the other views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this opens a dialog window to modify the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ wers for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and after one has chosen one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the keys to it below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this starts the K@@ 3@@ b ; unit assistant . therefore , the correct auth@@ oriz@@ ations are required to burn CDs and DVDs . therefore , you must enter the system administrator &apos;s password for the system administrator ( root ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for example , general program settings can be performed . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b should work . this dialog is intended to person@@ alize and intended to adjust the program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; K@@ DE ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ interface . using this interface , parts of functionality may be controlled via a shell script . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions can be used , either the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or something more convenient program k@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are crucial in the function scope , which is more important to your task and the type of your task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this chapter , we assume that you use the command line utility d@@ co@@ p . to make use of the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; you must make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b is started . then enter something like the following on the console : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that all &amp; K@@ DE ; program has been fully supported , supports &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts are described below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface by &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; features like copy@@ CD , format DVD and other functions for creating new projects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ ways ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ .@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ .@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ .@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) vo@@ id copy@@ rights ( ) Vo@@ id bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ f ( ) Vo@@ id bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ f ( ) Vo@@ id bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ f ( ) Vo@@ id bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ f ( ) Vo@@ id bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ f ( ) Vo@@ id bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( URL )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you can create a D@@ CO@@ P reference on the newly created project : # K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project by using # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface which is applicable to data projects only ( CD and DVD ) :
vo@@ id cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) Vo@@ id add@@ ur@@ l ( URL ) Vo@@ id met@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String ) Vo@@ id met@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String ) Vo@@ id met@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String ) Vo@@ id met@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path ) Vo@@ id Tran@@ qu@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then add files to the new folder : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b -@@ cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ ate@@ l / home / tru@@ cover / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an audio CD is an audio CD , read out and stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats can be read , depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ - is the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading from MP3 files on the hard disk ) and of many co@@ di@@ ers to en@@ code those wa@@ v files ( compression @-@ free compression ) . additional co@@ ders may be added to the program ( if installed are installed ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , the titles of the &amp; CD are read , read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a second step , WAV files are usually compressed into the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or in other formats such as los@@ s@@ less F@@ LA@@ C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first step , read out the &amp; CD , is compiled by &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it has to be done now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other co@@ effici@@ ents are already available , so it &apos;s not necessary to comp@@ ose some Linux distri@@ butions . if for example F@@ LA@@ C doesn &apos;t need to be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
which Ko@@ di@@ ff / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction about co@@ ders , audio quality and comp@@ ressing factors .
a word for copying the protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ ia to read the audio data from the &amp; CD . this program is not possible to avoid any copy protection . in any case it can &apos;t be able to avoid any copy protection . just avoid the copy of the copy protected audio CD ; s !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while setting only one needs to be performed ( the setup dialog can be called so often ) , after the daily use of the user interface , this leads to the slim approach of the user interface that you often stum@@ ble on at the beginning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can convert many formats - depending on which co@@ effici@@ ents programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , F@@ LA@@ C &amp; etc . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can &amp; CD ; get information from the Free@@ D@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without network , whereby everything is covered manually . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only a short list of the instructions of the main window . on the side , you will find more information how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the register tab@@ s for the configuration of the program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ DB request will start the CD data according to the device on request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case the connection must first be made to the internet . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
start reading and - if a Encoder is configured in the plug @-@ in tab in the setup procedure - the coding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available Encoder , so that the selection with another encoder can be read than the standard . it is to be observed before the encoder is configured in the setup dialog in the setup dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens the file manager , so an already selected file will be selected instead of a full &amp; CD and code to code . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( such as read out the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens the main landmark dialog by &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ u ; with different file cards ( such as Encoder , for setting the en@@ co@@ ders ) . you &apos;ll need to go before the program can be successfully used ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this chapter describes sound quality , cor@@ di@@ ers and compression ratios as well as help you choosing the right code .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if no audio information is lost , any los@@ s@@ less audio format is required . in addition to F@@ LA@@ C there are also other than &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; Mon@@ key &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression ratios and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the audio formats that lose information through data compression , MP3 and OGG are the most common . OGG may today have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences will produce less important audio quality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame will still be included with most distri@@ butions free of free , but there are open license questions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
+ high to high quality sound quality ( high bit@@ rates ) but compared to OGG slightly deeper quality with deep bit@@ rates .
OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG storage devices is available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo equipment . nowadays , these devices usually support MP3 format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression ratios for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for additional parameter ) :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting yields good transparency to most people and most of the music &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &apos; --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = This attitude should usually offer most people and most of the music acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo devices with high quality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 up to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR . compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo devices with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate for 5.5 . needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo devices with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR @-@ joint stereo , compression rate of around 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . well enough for music by you@@ ths , portable devices and auto@@ stere@@ os@@ systems . but not good enough for stereo hi @-@ fi systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &apos; --@@ pre@@ set Ins@@ ane &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you don &apos;t want the highest quality without regard to the file size , then choose this setting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; CD ; information that can be entered manually or by the program automatically from the Free@@ D@@ b via the Internet , are available as a list of parameters . you can be transferred / needed to create files and file names , as well as the attributes of music files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in connection with Ko@@ di@@ re programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the code and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the Ko@@ di@@ ans explain the switch for these programs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example to add the &amp; CD : title to the keyword ( English : day ) when MP@@ 3@@ s can be encoded with l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ file needs to be added . the result looks like : &apos; ... w@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ - ; parameters which can be needed ( = button designation in assist@@ ants ) :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is what Free@@ D@@ b is : a free database , in which persons can download the audio CDs to be able to enter the information instead of the text file ; it is too aware that all others can download it by yourself : &amp; CD ; title , artist , name of the plays &amp; etc . , not by the audio file itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( An@@ m. of the transi@@ ent ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can be added to the artist nor the music . any information can be added to the artist by a &amp; CD : business , physical or virtual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ u ; it is active to select a check box ( sending an address ) . in this type of configuration it does not seem to be used with another ( f@@ ake ) address when calling the data from the server ( this can only know the programmer &apos;s information ) . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in many countries , there are copies of the main database . if it is set up in many countries , the ge@@ ographic will be used to use Free@@ D@@ b . this saves bandwidth in the network and correc@@ ts the load between the hosts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of fried servers for the online retrieve of &amp; CD ; for information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which selection range is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are rum@@ ours that cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used , looking in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading Audio CD . see that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must be installed first , if this has not happened yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for storing the selected WAV files , the code can be selected and therefore the desired file format ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and F@@ LA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) can be added on this tab . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ko@@ di@@ pper package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution , before the co@@ d@@ ders may be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined Ko@@ di@@ ers . more information about co@@ effici@@ ents are in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ d@@ erer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after installing a Ko@@ di@@ er &apos;s installation , you can receive more information about his switches using the command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can have many causes . check the device of the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , the writing and reading of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , F@@ LA@@ C &amp; etc . ) , try both programs with a command line in one terminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
check if you do not want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the shell of the &amp; CD . this will not succeed !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a chapter with a step by step . even if you use other settings , this can give advice as you have to proceed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have read the complete manual , all understood , but are somehow still uns@@ af@@ e what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step in order to set those areas that you want to do what you want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this example we will start the program for the first time to set up everything and use our first &amp; CD . we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 up to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 keyword ( tags ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . in any case it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , whatever you can do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please make sure the directory / us@@ r / share / cd has , and that you have scre@@ aming to it ( eg ; by copying it with the kon@@ quer@@ or ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first section covers basic set @-@ up &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ - , something which is presumably done once and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second section describes the procedure to read out a &amp; CD , which needs to be repeated for any release &amp; CD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here we determine the resulting code to use the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 up to 256 k@@ bps ) . it will be used to use the program that will use Free@@ D@@ b to use the Free@@ D@@ b to download the data from the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change it with any reading of a &amp; CD ; change once the matching settings are found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the device name is handed over to the reading program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; frequently , / dev / c@@ drom are a symbolic link to the actual device name of your running process . if this is not working or if it works with other programs , it can also help the device records for the CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the map of General Settings . here is not much to do . here , an additional transformation can be defined . in our example , everything will be used / entered as shown in the screen photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only For incomplete information , so that you will be informed when details are missing when creating j@@ ig@@ s ( tags ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the card holder CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable to download and release the &amp; CD ; data automatically via the Internet from a Free@@ D@@ b computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : the computer must be connected to the reading of the &amp; CD , so that it can access the Free@@ D@@ b server . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second selection box is simpler , a &amp; CD player ; this can be easily changed with the database name and the resulting folder name / fil@@ en@@ ame and the ID3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; K@@ DE ; tag@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from this example , it is further to note : if you want to use everything manually in the Off@@ line mode , the two drop @-@ down mode will be selected , at least the first choice is set up . however , this mode is set up on the following card card . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD@@ DB is for us Free@@ D@@ b . these are settings for the data inquiry . this is settings for the retrieve of the CD . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the article about Free@@ D@@ b . put everything as shown in the screenshot picture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD@@ DB servers : please go to the site fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and take a look at the mirror server in your vicinity . this way the load is distributed between the hosts . however this setting will work as first try .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both operate the same as the server , as many fire@@ walls date the protocol 80 , because the protocol is 80 , because the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surfing on the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this example , we do not want to transmit data to Free@@ D@@ b Server . disable the first check box . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; simply take the settings of your screen photo . ( make sure that the folder / t@@ mp will exist on your computer ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; number of simultaneous pieces : sorry , is there a reason why more than one at the same time ? parallel reading and en@@ code ? the author does not know , therefore simply try . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD ; after reading the last piece out : tick this to the &amp; CD . throw it out at the end of the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; custom folder for temporary files : if you can tick this , then the path / folders will be useful if you don &apos;t want to check the files in the private folder . if you don &apos;t want to do this folder , if you want to do something with WAV files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in this way , as it is on the screenshot of the screen . the command is slightly long , under circumstances something to be blown to the right to see everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , the resulting bit@@ rate is about 224 up to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
note the associated entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of tags on version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1 &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags : internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and output file ( including the complete path ) .
put the rest like in the screen photo . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneous WAV files at the same time : in a du@@ al@@ Core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can try to en@@ code more than a WAV file simultaneously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic set of &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ files ; this configuration is used as standard for any reading of a &amp; CD . if you have chosen the organisational structure of your music , you never need to change them again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this section , described as the process of reading the &amp; CD is described . we will be able to fet@@ ch MP3 files . the file structure , as we are convenient and the CD ; data from the Free@@ D@@ b must be set up , must be repeated for any release &amp; CD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we use a &amp; CD , the screen photos do not contain a little different than those for a &amp; CD . so you will learn the &amp; CD ; instead of fet@@ ching them from the internet . comments will refer to the differences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
try not the &amp; CD ; this example can be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; issue of author this manual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this is not done , the &amp; CD now has to be pushed in the drive that has been defined in the main window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as shown in the screen photo . this only can be identified as an audio CD , and can be identified by cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this does not happen , search the questions and answers following the help or go back to previous section concerning the basic settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attention : if the &amp; CD could be collected from the Free@@ D@@ b , all titles are already completed and the name of the artist and the album are displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; Key to your &amp; CD , and you can select the database entry , which your opinion is best to your &amp; CD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you don &apos;t have the check box for the automatic query of Free@@ D@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for settings ) , you can also manually trigger the data from the Internet , but you need to connect to the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD editor - entering the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo . select the title of the piece in the input field &apos; Update &apos; to the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the artist must not be entered into the input field &apos; Update title &apos; , unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lower commentary box can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ mm@@ ers per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments which apply to all pieces of the CD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attention : after the successful retrieve of the data from Free@@ D@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it &apos;s always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted notes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
note : in this example we use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment area . if you are using ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags : do not have an unlimited field of code ; take a look at the &apos; Basic Settings &apos; tab .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can change the tag information of the created files later with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tags are not supported by all the codes or file formats . see the help for the co@@ ders to obtain more information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; simply select an entry , obviously right with the style of the output CD . in this example , this is not important to find information about the categories . pop or ra@@ p are available for further information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , come back to the main window . simply click on line with the second piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD editing window appears again and you can see that the fields are already filled with the entered data , which we have recorded for the first piece . just type the entries for the fields of the current piece . enter the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click on the next line in the main window and process you to the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
attention : this window doesn &apos;t appear if you have downloaded the data from the Free@@ D@@ b . it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the third button of tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed on the unit list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note that there is a check of notes before every line of a piece . only the title can be selected , or select the All pieces onto the bottom edge of the screen to select all pieces at once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was launched by clicking on the button selection out of the les@@ bian process , so this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we will look at the window with the entries and track what is going on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click on the tab orders to switch on the order window . it is in the top half of the window , directly below the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the window for controlling orders . the first piece is displayed on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the lower part of the window in the status bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this error message will you see if you are trying to work with a co@@ d@@ eter you have not yet installed . pieces which have not been encoded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target folders are not what we have entered here in the example . do you have checked on the folder for temporary files and the target folders ? ; - ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is clear , why the error has occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new listing : order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . so read out and en@@ code parallel . notice the status window in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the author of the program does not have a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behaviour . the only calcul@@ able machine is the result . the used machine with an am@@ d@@ 64 does not seem to read and en@@ code ( of course , two different tracks ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the last title is read , while another piece is coded and a third order is coded in the queu@@ e of the Ko@@ di@@ st . after the last piece is encoded , a small window will be inserted in the upper left part of the window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ u , you need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.@@ x and 4.@@ x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG , you need the code of your choice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , as part of the k@@ dem@@ or@@ media package , you can download it from there . most distri@@ butions do already contain a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; K@@ DE ; package you may read from there . if you read this , you have probably already done it ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this section is directed to people who comp@@ ile from source files , and not intended for users to use a pre @-@ compiled package of your distribution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are looking for help like your needs to be adjusted , the following is correct for you : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a program that calls many different programs , has many variants of settings . best , read the step by using the options and settings , and also includes comments on options which are not used in the example . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hello , always on reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any reference like it will be on the disk ( above all , if it is on the drive ) , or from an unusually short menu ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what does it work ? who reads this is probably the program started . it should look like this :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author can &apos;t notice this manual or change it . at least after contact with the author . and if you read this , he did this section and agree with this proposal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strange if it is managed to fet@@ ch the source file from &amp; K@@ DE ; SV@@ N , you don &apos;t need to take these instructions , but ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; K@@ mid ; is the Mi@@ di@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke from &amp; K@@ DE ; in addition to others it has not made some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ a@@ oke real @-@ time images that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; c@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD is running on the O@@ SS system ; it should also work on all systems with O@@ SS - und &amp; K@@ DE ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project drivers which is needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA will be included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ en@@ cer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; K@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by up@@ lifting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can move in &amp; K@@ DE ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to KM@@ id .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( property events , or tex@@ ter@@ ings ) . KM@@ id determines the process used automatically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
seat support . if you exit &amp; K@@ DE ; while playing a song you will start S@@ id for the next time with the same song .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , you can select ... from the File Open . it appears the usual file dialogue with which help you select the song you want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also make a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Windows into the &amp; c@@ mid , and it also works with several songs simultaneously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play a piece of music , open it and che@@ er the button to play in the tool@@ bar , select the entry to play from the menu piece or do the space bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please note that &amp; mid ; one piece automatically starts , as soon as you drag it to the &amp; c@@ mid ; ( with several pieces they will add to a collection and then played one another . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once &amp; c@@ mid , a piece plays out , you can jump to any spot by using the middle button and drive with the kno@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you find that a song is too fast or too slow , you can change to the arrows left and right of the pace . to get back the original pace , click the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , then a pressure on the button break is played as a pressure on the button break , interrup@@ ts the reproduction . note the space bar while not playing , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lyrics may be stored on two types in a piece of music . some pieces use text lines , others use lyrics and other both . some pieces do not have a text : - ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; c@@ mid , you can set up which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type will be determined automatically . if you do not have the option to change it manually , so you have the option to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to set up an event type , select the entries tex@@ ter@@ land@@ ings or lying events . same function also have the keys 1 and 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files which you will summar@@ ize . in this section , as you can use collections efficiently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you &apos;ll find this in the menu collection under the point Organ@@ ize .... click on New and give the name for the collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying , and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as original . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have more than one collection , you can adjust the induc@@ tors in the collection manager . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
into the temporary collection all songs you want to add to any other collection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when leaving the application this collection is not saved . concerns , if you add a lot of pieces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to add songs to a collection , it has to add a song using the button . it appears again the File dialog , with which help you can select the song . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a second method to add a song , depends on setting automatic adding to the collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when automatic add to the collection , a piece will be added to the active collection ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when automatic add to the collection , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied . the collection will then be added to the collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and select the song and then click on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can select the order in which the songs may be played , and the songs are played back in the order , as they have been added to the collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you add songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to play a song , select it in the collection manager or use the selection list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to jump a song , choose the button next song , the entry next song from the menu or press the arrow right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to reverse a song , choose the button , select the previous piece from the menu or press the arrow left . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click on the button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the temporary collection can &apos;t be deleted . however , this doesn &apos;t matter as it is stored when leaving &amp; c@@ mid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is essential to syn@@ thesizer , which are not General MIDI capable . in this case the MIDI @-@ Map General MIDI Events will be translated into events that understands the syn@@ thesizer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , you can create an MIDI map which converts all the events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the change type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et , and thus becoming a trumpet if originally a piano should play . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you only have a sound card , you do not need MIDI map because all sound@@ card GM are compatible ( including AW@@ E and G@@ US Cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI files . so you need to edit the appropriate file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all required measures for playing a piece of pieces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every section may appear only once , except the Key@@ map section , which may appear so often as desired . but for this , every occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Name of Key@@ map &quot; Name of Key@@ map ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Op@@ tions ... EN@@ D
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that one section begins ( except for Op@@ tions ) and EN@@ D , that the end of a section is reached . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please send me your map file as email , so that I may offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be used for devices that are not General MIDI compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this section , as the patches of General MIDI is shown on your specific keyboard , the general use looks as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please note that the left side of the equation is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to lay all tones above , in the tone with the number M . if your keyboard , for example , do not take a gun ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which may include a tissue in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so if an MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 ( guns on your Keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please note that here is the term drum patch of the patch , with which each tone is a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ing instrument ( drum , pel@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc . ) , and not the one that means the tone of the same drum ( as some keyboards have it ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Key@@ map section will be used to attach , such sounds on a given channel or instrument . the use is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , and their presence . so you have to create 128 entries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can define multiple Key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument , you only need to use different names in the first line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; key@@ maps are mainly needed to train sounds on the perc@@ us@@ sions channel . take a look , for example , the included key@@ maps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this section can be used to link some can@@ als to others . if you want to exchange for example the first and the second channel , simply do it in CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , these settings are useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a given channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , assembled according to the following pattern : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
n is the channel which is shown on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option you will need to change the Key@@ map option on this canal . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option to change the patch on this canal . in this case patch x is used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example , to always use the perc@@ us@@ sions patch on the perc@@ us@@ sions channel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio can be multiplied in which ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der event will be multiplied with the value n ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed until the value of 40@@ 96 , so it will not be used in the map file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this setting is needed to play a keyboard , which will play a Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , try some keyboards to play on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; c@@ mid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use an MIDI map , simply open the MIDI settings dialog . you will find these in the menu settings , point MIDI settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the channel view is a window with a whole range of pi@@ vi@@ atures ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these bar@@ racks , see which sounds are played . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a given channel . if you have changed an instrument , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the channel view has two different views to show the played sounds , and view in the Settings menu under the point channel view : settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speed LCD displays the speed , which is played with a song . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down , use the arrows left and right of the LCD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece has to be played . it contains the same MIDI file on two different devices , as well as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , I can not force anybody , &amp; c@@ mid ; but you can use a similar sound quality , while a mp3 @-@ file requires a similar sound quality . with an MIDI file you can also change the single instruments , speed &amp; etc . they have control over everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that can happen if you have compiled a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; c@@ mid . to fix the problem , you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add any files one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acceptance , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; c@@ mid ; window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to add automatic Add to the collection , otherwise files are added to the temporary collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can convert the arrow keys to the left of Tem@@ po@@ - LCD , to slow down the playback . to double @-@ click on the LCD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;ve been on a &amp; K@@ DE ; desktop an &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows with my MIDI folders and to@@ k@@ mid ; in this way I need to play if the collection is played at the end or I want to play a file in the window of &amp; k@@ mid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to listen to a file quickly without it to a collection , turn off automatic adding to the collection , and the new file will be added to the temporary collection . open files &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. access only want to add automatic add to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection contains exactly this one MIDI file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then you can also record , including B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these people have sent MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , I encourage you to program further on &amp; c@@ mid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I studied mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a ( Spain ) . I studied mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a . I try to take a bit of time for my hob@@ bies . I try to play MIDI files for my hob@@ bies . I have to do MIDI files in making music and make phr@@ ases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to know where they can download MIDI / kar@@ a@@ oke files , if you want to make an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; c@@ mid , please write to me an e @-@ mail : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ kis@@ .@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they really make me a huge joy when you send me a postcard from your place or a Mi@@ di@@ - / kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group , but if you want to send an MIDI file , you should get in touch with me as I might have the file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &amp; c@@ mid , I wrote &amp; c@@ mid , completely written in my free time and I will therefore empha@@ size it . I would therefore only recommend that I get feedback from users ( post cards or e @-@ mail ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wai and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - correction of error that the pitch of AW@@ E cards was too high .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my thanks also applies to Jose L@@ us San@@ chez for testing the G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ ek@@ er , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and of course , my thanks also applies to all these excellent musicians in the net that give us this wonderful mi@@ di@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , &amp; c@@ mid can also be found on its website which can be viewed as htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ ver@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ ht@@ ml . you will also find links to websites with other kar@@ a@@ oke songs , &amp; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer as the sound quality depends greatly on your sound card . it &apos;s not the same if you use a FM radio or a AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card you have to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ D@@ EM@@ O _ ON@@ LY@@ V@@ I@@ SU@@ AL . it works as if you had a sound card so you can &apos;t hear music .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; K@@ DE ; mail@@ ing@@ lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files from M@@ Player or Phon@@ on formats , as well as to play DVD , VCD , or TV and Camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the documentation for &amp; c@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; K@@ DE ; installed on this computer .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website to new versions or send the question to The &amp; K@@ DE ; user mailing list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the playlist . and finally , there is a window with the playlist . and finally , there is a window with the playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is possible to save the preferred connections with the menu book@@ marks , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries , you should use the category of continuous play@@ lists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarchy and all its sub@@ groups to the current category and playback begins with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and continuous play@@ lists can also be changed by direct editing of XML configuration files . of course you can only do if you click on a name cli@@ cked on it and as next working mode . by clicking a sub@@ group only the XML content of this particle is displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after changing XML files , must be selected from the menu with the playlist and select either the participant mode or selected a different category . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all changes are lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without using the playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result of the convenience of the author &amp; k@@ mp@@ layer , some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the animation when starting and closing can be disabled by editing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c and modi@@ fying &#91; General Op@@ tions &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 indicated option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can simply be inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; k@@ mp@@ layer / ml / k@@ mp@@ layer / intro@@ ver@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ mp@@ layer / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the animation does not need to be short , it will automatically stop by opening a different source . this would end in the end animation , however , the user can stop the application a second time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an easy example of a Start @-@ Animation can be the ads of a favorite photos ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / glu@@ es ; In the source package of &amp; k@@ mp@@ layer ; are contained in the source package / some examples of SM@@ IL that are supported by &amp; k@@ mp@@ layer ;
there is a rider to configuration M@@ Player in configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ mp@@ layer ; here the path of the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things can be adjusted .
another tool for troub@@ les@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ mp@@ layer . here is the output of mp@@ layer .
there is no rider for this ren@@ dition to be configured in the configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ mp@@ layer . everything must be configured by manual editing of the image ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ Mozilla &apos; module :
&apos; Flash &apos; can be play@@ able inside &amp; mp@@ layer ; it can even be included the special field Emb@@ ed for YouTube in the playlist .
so that the &amp; mp@@ layer ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages and has to be used as a service provider for the M@@ ime type Application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog file access by K@@ DE .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; mp@@ layer ; can be used in a console application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . if there is no error , the back@@ end output is to be checked in &amp; mp@@ layer ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this always a pre@@ set back@@ end for a particular m@@ ime type ( of course only if this was determined ) must be done by manual change of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should play all og@@ g files :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; mp@@ layer ; can play of TV cards , either via M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this requires k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV , you need to use to be used device and the TV channels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to configure the V@@ DR ( Video Data Recorder ) settings in the mp@@ layer is the dialog in the Settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there is no need to be found out of which one is selected . the correct coding method must be found ( e.g. it is PAL @-@ West Europe ) .
since the V@@ DR support of k@@ mp@@ layer only X@@ Video can use only ( probably this type of playing video equipment is not working ) . this is why the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension must be functional for the X server . this is why the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension must be functional for the X server . this is why the video file must be included in his configuration file ( / etc / X11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internally , the KM@@ Player is used for sources different names . at the time of this documentation , these dv@@ d@@ na@@ v@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , scrip@@ ture source , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . when they activate , they start with playing the playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are there hints as I can do my CD@@ ROM drive , if I play it from him ( not from the v@@ cd : / / ) ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is done as user root after integration of the device . it is absolutely sure to make / dev / c@@ drom on the CD@@ ROM drive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ ine only picks up slowly , why does my CPU have to test on their performance every time ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
note : the answer is over@@ hol@@ e. k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer does automatically require the last saved value only the first time x@@ ine will test the CPU .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of these components can be used in the &amp; Linux ; distribution will be included . for installation , documentation of the distribution or installation CD / DVD should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; k@@ ile ; project includes some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions , enabling simple installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the k@@ ile ; website included . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; K@@ DE ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all proposals are requested for documentation . if the support for this project or documentation is requested , the contact about the k@@ ile ; website should be established . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to get questions or when you comp@@ ile , extensions are requested , this should be addressed on the mailing list k@@ ile @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the use of all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ desktop . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the ability to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphic interface and attachment tools for these . finally called &amp; k@@ ile ; the ability to operate as well as conversion and attachment tools for these . finally called &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and the powerful project management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and you can learn the hand@@ book of Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile , can be read directly with the editor of Prince &amp; Kate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right exit : La@@ y @-@ TECH . used to operate the ur@@ k &amp; tex ; it can also be used to use a la@@ e ( English . lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; it can also be a less sophisticated but more realistic interpretation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , here is only a good view to &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is not the ultimate book to do so , such as H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 da@@ isy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as other marking languages includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction , with which the general characteristics , such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text file , will be closed with the command \ \ &apos; { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ &apos; { document } . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the high @-@ speed assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a unique feature for the fast preparation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile , which provides a few mills for the creation of the document . it can also be done on the document related settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; article &#91; Letter &#93; , Book &#91; Letter &#93; , Book &#91; Profile &#93; , Book &#91; Letter &#93; , Book &#91; Report &#93; , Report &#91; Report &#93; , Report &#91; Profile &#93; , Report &#91; Profile &#93; , Book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , Book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , Book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , projector &#91; Read &#93; , Films &#91; Prosp@@ er &#93; or custom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
en@@ coding : this is set to set character en@@ coding . modern systems increasingly use UTF @-@ 8 en@@ coding as standard . if UTF @-@ 8@@ x should be used ( to correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) documents ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this list contains the most used packages for de@@ lat@@ ex ; for free , they can only be selected in the check box . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; articles ( DIN ) , The book ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the documentation class of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German texts ) you should always find the use of German texts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new users are now not worried about it , only a short description of functions and further information is given in the section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; hur@@ ry ; offers - as well as other source code editors , but the used commands to see that any mathematical environment is not closed . however , you should be able to save any mathematical environment . however , you will be able to save any mathematical environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when setting up a new command ( e.g. \ \ the { command } ) , this function can be created in the menu ( e.g. \ \ with { command } ) . this function can be used in the menu settings dialog . set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands can be disabled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all documents are normally divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; sub@@ set the signatures of the document into the following elements ( part is the most light and sub@@ stan@@ tive element ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the document in the structural view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files may be very helpful . as soon as a DVI ; file &#91; file extension &#93; created by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI ; viewer to the corresponding line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as font , converting and printing from DVI ; -@@ files for various systems and systems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when looking for example , the elements of the DVI ; file with the editor can be cli@@ cked , and as soon as soon as a element in the DVI ; file is cli@@ cked , it will be cli@@ cked to the appropriate place in DVI ; viewer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Master @-@ Document : this function is used in working with multiple files . using a master document the work is simplified with other integ@@ .@@ tex files . in the use of a project a project @-@ wide master document can be adjusted project settings .
fast : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result will be displayed automatically ( if no errors are available in the source code ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; monitoring of file : in this mode the DVI ; file on the n@@ der@@ un@@ gen@@ â has been for@@ ce@@ able , and there is no call to &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after rapid construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in selecting the tool tool@@ bar the three large boxes should be developed for the fast entry of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The instructions for the sub@@ division are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the field of selection is for items such as keywords , mer@@ gers , notes or references . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
name : this command is intended for a section that creates a picture or a different element .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference : is used for the reference to a fixed name ( selection , list ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when using quote , a selection list is displayed with literary inserts . for the editing of &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; the author has good experiences with &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; -@@ files can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; written by hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last drop @-@ down box is used for the general text of the text for the main text , the Fu@@ Ã © notes etc. are used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when calling &amp; k@@ ile , two selection criteria are available : 1 . the wiz@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and st@@ acking settings . 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brackets according to the command \ \ &apos; class will contain the settings for the command . the font is not set at the beginning , this can also be done in text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the above source code , the &amp; lat@@ ex has to be compiled . the simpl@@ est way to this is the use of construction or the push of a button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the source code must be stored before comp@@ ile . &amp; k@@ ile ; for storing the storage automatically .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the comp@@ iling of the document fails , should be chosen in logging after the errors . if used by rapid construction &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; this is not the case , should also be assessed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a environment ( English environment ) is a text that is covered differently than the remaining document . for example , a report with the font list is to provide a different font in the surrounding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; \ \ &apos; , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the changes will only be careful within the environment ( of \ \ , { environment } until \ \ end { environment } ) . there are no fittings ( number ) for opening within a environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , there are many possibilities to enhance the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . these commands may be added either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
\ \ &apos; book { adver@@ h } : this command is for the cur@@ b pressure and is as long as G@@ Ã ¼ l@@ tig before it is closed with a \ \ &apos; { adver@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be cur@@ ated with \ \ &apos; s { word } .
\ \ Qu@@ ote : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ begin { Qu@@ ote } and ends with \ \ end { Qu@@ ote } .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the background is presented to the source code with the lat@@ ex , a step @-@ by @-@ step instructions for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the wiz@@ ard has been entered a bit text , a few adjustments for the better legi@@ bility of the document should be accomplished . a quote , a few positions in the fat and cran@@ ial pressure and a poem to be applied to see the differences of these commands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the document has been viewed , it can be turned back to the editor by editor View or Str@@ g E ( internal viewer ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and fun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
DVI ; is a separate file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ ca ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability of several drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output like printers , &amp; mail@@ box ; / PDF -@@ transformation or computer screen shots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file the same steps are printed as for the preparation of the document ( see ) . in the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can be printed correctly ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tool@@ bar conversion is the conversion of DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is created , the conversion can begin to add other formats using the P@@ FE button in the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to add the direct jump from the editor to the added position within the DVI ; file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers an appropriate setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; bin@@ aries files . for this purpose only Modern under Settings K@@ ile must set up ... tools building has to be selected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to search for the fore@@ sight , the mouse cur@@ sor has to be positioned in a line of the source tree and close on fore@@ sight . jump to the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer will then be done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; it is done with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ Put the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document by &amp; k@@ ile ; open and set ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; as text editor can set up ( Settings oc@@ ular@@ line ... Editor )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if using quick @-@ fitting of &amp; DVI ; viewer cannot be able to receive an error , this will display in the logging file or in the news window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the logging file may be used to check the error source in the source code . in the editor you can click on the error in the logging file . in order to be able to check the error in the logging , you need to enter the error in the logging . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once click on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to choose the template for the document . the default mut@@ ations are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when selecting a remote document , a document can be used either by the reason or the wiz@@ ard for quick creating a new document . further information is included in the section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
high @-@ operation users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for virtually all documents . templates can be stored and loaded in order to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template - either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file open or created a new file . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template by means of an existing document and selecting file from document ... Cre@@ ate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when creating a new document out of a template by a New document , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or string code ) . these variables can be set up in settings ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings of which variables be replaced : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CL@@ AS@@ SO@@ P@@ TI@@ ON@@ S $ $ : this string is being replaced by the input in document class . typically they are used in document class . typically they will be used as : \ \ document@@ aries &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CL@@ AS@@ SO@@ P@@ TI@@ ON@@ S $ $ &#93; { items } .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wiz@@ ard , and the associated entry commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when creating a new document , your own template can be selected instead of the standard machines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex works ; a simple way to creating a template , should be searched on the internet and the steps described below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers with the possibilities of reading and high@@ lighting of many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for them directly from &amp; k@@ ile ; can be carried out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to learn more about Kate and Kate ; and to learn more , the manual should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile , you can start reading works directly with the editor of &amp; Kate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference that can be called for the menu help La@@ Te@@ X reference . you will be able to find a valid description of nearly all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use of them as well as their syntax .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; double @-@ click with a tr@@ unc@@ ated road , around the &amp; tex ; that means that in this way in clicking on \ \ par of \ \ par . \ \ par . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when pulling the text with penet@@ rated lin@@ ker mouse , the text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when using the arrow keys you can also select parts of the source tree in the editing window .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; hur@@ ry ; for example , fitting the different types of source tex@@ ts and empha@@ size them . for example , the lat@@ ex commands differ from normal text and also the mathematical formu@@ la@@ e are highlighted by another colour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many assist@@ ants can be added to each other . this is a separate type of book@@ marks within the text . the volumes are empha@@ sized , so that they are automatically ski@@ pped when entering a character . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; k@@ ile , . although &amp; Kate , have already under@@ gone many environments and groups and therefore under@@ line ; special commands for their selection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; records a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing on both sides ) . this extended meaning is not meant to contain tables , &amp; lat@@ ex : -@@ commands and all other rows of the source text . this means that the shut@@ ters are separated by two empty lines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the word radi@@ ated under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection has also an extended meaning as this command also has &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands with a coloring ( \ \ ) command and an additional star ( * ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to listen to a part of the document it can be balanced out of this first and removed through the entire line . &amp; k@@ ile , offers the following commands for a faster result . under Edit removing are the following commands to delete the text : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remove a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile , is included in the description to edit records . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was already evident that environments can play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; k@@ ile , for further orders under editing environment for a better simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this command , jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed right in front of the command to open the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this command , jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to the surrounding area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the cur@@ sor is before or within the command \ \ takes place , the end of the environment is inj@@ ected ( or vice versa ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the input of many wa@@ sted ambient commands can quickly get lost . this command close the latest environment , so the closed environment structure will not break down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by stap@@ les { ... } . among the Edit Te@@ X group there are some important commands that match the Edit surrounding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this command , jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly before the gentle cap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this command , the end of the current group is inj@@ ected ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the lock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the cur@@ sor is before or behind the bra@@ ins of a &amp; tex ; group # is , the other end of the group is inj@@ ected ( or vice versa ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when entering many wa@@ sted groups brackets , this command can quickly be lost . this command close the last open group , so that the wa@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex will not break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex , two simple instructions for the application will be used in &amp; k@@ ile . for the purpose of the application the sign is used . &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case as well as two . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this automatic insert of double quotes can be set up under Settings K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X to be switched on and out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also use the specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or French ) , and with German or French announ@@ cing signs . there are also many other languages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you look down from Shift ; Sp@@ read and k@@ ile , the current position within a lists environment ( e. g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , if the current position within a lists -@@ environment ( e. g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , it is not only a line @-@ down but also the command \ \ item . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
close within a tables environment . close &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with a pin @-@ end break .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to under@@ line default and lat@@ ex ; - or custom @-@ defined environments . you can set up ... La@@ Te@@ X .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some users can classi@@ fy the columns into tables surrounding and all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) ; seek &amp; ile , according to the most useful tab@@ ulator in the column ; while this tab is not added to the columns of the current tab@@ ulator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although &amp; Kate , this is already a good source code , this was built in &amp; k@@ ile ; in order to set up specific commands ( usually for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) all these modes are set up for various working modes under settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a new setting with the command \ \ begin is { surroundings } , &amp; k@@ ile , automatically add the command \ \ end { surroundings } after an empty line ( for the text ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the bar key is removed , the last letter of the input is removed and fully ref@@ uted to the whole list . on the other hand , the list may also be reduced by entering a further letter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are protected by &amp; k@@ ile . alternatively you can jump to these positions via edit diving brands and the desired parameters can be done afterwards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under settings k@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile , remo@@ del@@ ing settings to these lists ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands as well as lock@@ ers of the general language used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the command mode is not optional for the use of environments . on the other hand , a few letters with \ \ &apos; s will be entered and the use of the whole procedure will be used as often as &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for the processing of environments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you enter the whole area or the ke@@ yst@@ r@@ zel Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment will be done automatically and it appears to be terminated in the simpl@@ est way and will be finished by pressing the input bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after thorough , the environment will automatically be closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile , recognizes that it is a lists environment , it is even a first \ \ item command . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under settings k@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile , remo@@ del@@ ing settings to these lists . this mode is used to list the list of processing Mode ; and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; supports user @-@ defined lists of remote strings that are used immediately by setting strings . the lists can be created in ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l which is used for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the letter L was entered and the word can be diver@@ ted through the men@@ tion@@ r@@ zel Str@@ g + alt box , the letter L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; large ham@@ bur@@ ners are not helpful for automatic los@@ s@@ ation . however , many winners in a document has been written more than once . so , &amp; k@@ ile , the whole has been written . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this mode can set up in the menu settings K@@ ile . here , the swelling for the display can be determined here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dialog graphics look for graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics of graphics formats , the sections should be considered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PS -@@ files are not as known as PDF files , but we offer an excellent basis for the changes and new orders of pages . if the PDF file is newly arranged and then it can be converted to ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be able to read the results of the work , the source code must be compiled in the volume of creating comp@@ iling , converting and creating views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the comp@@ iling of the source code for ob@@ server such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the additional conversion can be turned into a PS file via Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file converted into a PS file and be viewed by Alt ; 5 the PS file .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when using control pressure , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if not a single viewer should be used , each time a new window will be opened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new project is asked for the project new project .... Hier@@ in will be asked for the following information for the project :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when entering the file name , the relative path of the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r file must be specified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the script function of &amp; k@@ ile , allows for use by EC@@ M@@ AS@@ cript -@@ Ko@@ de . the scripts can be managed in the vertical glue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the API scripts are not yet developed yet , and can be moved in further versions of &amp; k@@ ile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , it has to be said that the evaluation environment of the scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a system@@ wide object ( = k@@ ile ) has the following methods : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; tet@@ ex , and &amp; tex@@ tured ; are supplied with many documents . this includes documentation for the packages and a further &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not just a description for es@@ r &amp; tex ; and it is not only for a description of all programs ( but a few important pack@@ ets are described ) , but rather is a fully categ@@ orized document for a certain form@@ atting . because it is a very large document it is in &amp; k@@ ile , divided into three important book@@ marks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the quantity of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tured ; the small application is not always simple ; / tex@@ tured ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k to which a database with all to &amp; k@@ ile ; supplied with all documents and includes a graphic top view .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this application expects a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if it is inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book , you can then remove the current work@@ book folder and specify them in the field of other folder the desired folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted each time when my pro@@ c is started .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as already said , everyone who worked at the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentary already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there is now a great graphical surface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the right file inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is , then they can simply select the current work@@ space . if not , select the current work@@ book and specify the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it comes to a copy of the screen , their file is fla@@ wed . please check the reported errors and try again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the file is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if not , delete the current file with the current file and select the file names using another file - file selection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you only want to know whether the file well is well , click the well @-@ to check selection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for use of a &amp; DT@@ D ; the file selection is specified in the &amp; DT@@ D ; ( external ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( external ) , file selection . both for the Rel@@ ax@@ NG verification is necessary as well as for the Rel@@ ax@@ NG verification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should the processing file be selected in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; then they can be selected , then remove the latest file and select the file selecting file names using the other file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter the file name , as the result will have to be given . the file is normally stored in their home folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plug@@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; may have a lot to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; therefore , the plug@@ in system will benefit immediately and must not wait until someone can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements can be found further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to install a plug@@ in or a K@@ Part , we start plug @-@ in Edit menu with the Edit menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this dialogue allows you to manage and add any contained plug@@ ins . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug@@ ins without a storage location is used &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path for searching plug @-@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people often work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties Project dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves to identify clear identification .
one member can have several roles in the project as well as for example both team manager and sub@@ project leader .
the user can look for himself from the list of team members who he is . this is done by the list of Team member and the S@@ etz@@ e button . the currently selected member ( its identity ) appears as bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the attitude of their own identity are important in terms of news and comments . see for further information on comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the overview of your team , there is another advantage by the capture of the members of the Team : it can be an event for information to the team administrator when something happens . see for further information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event actions are actions that are carried out if something happens in the project . one example would re@@ mark the opening of the public , or send a script that will add a file to the CVS as soon as it is added to the project , &amp; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project settings dialog , events , and will be edited and deleted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an email will be sent to the address specified in the recipient list . the addressing can be a team or sub@@ project leader . , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
comments are special comments in documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
notes enter is simple . it can be selected either the note -@@ listing from the editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment area followed by comment text .
notes can be sent to a defin@@ able member of the team . in this case the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( Role ) is a role in the project : team leader Sub@@ project leader after the enri@@ ching or sub @-@ project leaders to en@@ rich the corresponding range or sub@@ project names as shown in the following examples .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nick@@ names and roll@@ ers names are independent of big or small sp@@ elling , but space to the brackets and the : make the note invalid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and form@@ atting . the DT@@ D @-@ agnos@@ tic is and web@@ based form@@ atting and scrip@@ ting languages supported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings are at@@ tain@@ able via the Settings menu . here only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings will be found , a short description for others can be found in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the settings can be set up by settings Qu@@ anta . this dialog extends over a few pages that are covered in succession .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed . the entries are :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; big / small sp@@ elling of tags : large / small sp@@ elling of automatic tags . normal Groß / small sp@@ ell@@ ings means that tags are inserted , as they are described in the everyday XML files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; large / small sp@@ elling of attributes : large / small sp@@ elling of automatically added attributes . normal Groß / small sp@@ elling , the attributes are added as they are described in the everyday XML files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; optional tags automatically include : if checked , it is optional for tags , for which the closing day is optional , it is inserted after the &amp; gt ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automatically include optional tags : as above , above all other tags with the exception of simple tags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start and closing day automatically : when switched on , the closing day will be changed and vice versa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
automatic set of acc@@ ent characters : controls automatic conversion of ac@@ cent@@ ered characters into the corresponding en@@ coding during typ@@ ing .
M@@ IM@@ E types : mim@@ ic types used to identify various types of files . the default values can be restored using the Standard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; standard string en@@ coding : coding of newly created or in other ways as with opening open files ( where the coding of the file has been revised ) , but this setting will be out@@ lined by the same in the project properties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not detected , but this setting will be out@@ lined by the same in the project properties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; creates regularly backup copies , so that the document can be recovered from this backup at the next start of the program . this is not the same as saving the file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editing area or an own view ( or documentation in a box ) , which allows documentation to preview and the source code simultaneously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put the window settings back when the next start is useful when the user interface has come through changing the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views , it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the warning message segment is used to control the control of the option , displaying war@@ nings by attacks of no more in@@ quire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the place around the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; to change , it can define the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code view in the shared mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the illustration of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be adjusted in detail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of mouse click on the structure tree , it is possible to change the action by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the field of structural settings the visibility of the tree can be opened automatically when editing the tree and how deep in a change of the structure tree can be stopped automatically , while empty groups are found , while empty groups are not found in the current document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the section for setting short cuts ( a kind of templates ) that can be un@@ folded in bat@@ ches . abbrevi@@ ations are available in groups , each one can specify a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ cl@@ ause causes something else than in a group valid for Javascript . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plug@@ ins are managed to manage the plug@@ ins . plug@@ ins are K@@ part Applications of third side , which can be re @-@ used by any K@@ part application ; in inser@@ ting a plug @-@ ins must be the following : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
address : the path to the plug@@ in if it &apos;s not located on a standard like $ K@@ D@@ ED@@ IR / lib .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; input : this information will be delivered to the plug@@ in , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; component in the &quot; Only @-@ reading &quot; mode , check if the plug@@ in ref@@ uses the store . only beta @-@ K@@ parts usually refuse the loading if this option is not selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the Plugin : is this enabled , then tests &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the plug@@ in is not available when the plug@@ in is not available at the moment but it will be installed later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; starting from version 3.3 , the troub@@ les@@ hooting is completely re@@ developed . a de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ plug@@ in concept was implemented as well as the support for the d@@ b@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently only a plug@@ in is available to support the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in@@ qu@@ ito .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with choosing an appropriate de@@ bu@@ gger plug@@ ins in the project settings . with the button in addition to the de@@ bu@@ gger plug@@ in , the specific settings can be changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; user interface :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a view , displayed in the content of over@@ grown variables , appears normally in the left hand dock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a view , in which all handles points , are listed with line numbers and conditions . usually appears in the lower dock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a view that is shown in the issue ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bug@@ gers , appears normally in the lower dock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or a part of the following functionality is available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this action , the connection is made to de@@ bu@@ gger if necessary , or it spl@@ its the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bu@@ gger , so that a de@@ bu@@ gger that normally doesn &apos;t have to be considered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the counter@@ part of de@@ bug@@ ging session starts the session . close the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , or stop the l@@ umps according to requirements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sending an HTTP request to the server for a de@@ bug requirements . this is equivalent to the use of a browser , in order to see the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger to start with the execution of the script and the current line continuously . if this happens when the script is stopped , the execution will start before a debit request will start the script begins with the request . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger to start with the execution of the script , without information on alert variables and the current line number . if this happens when a script requirement has been given , the execution will start as soon as a requirement is made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger conduc@@ ts the next instruction in the script , without entering functions or include . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger conduc@@ ts the next instruction in the script , although possible when possible in functions and include . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the instruction and go to the next so , as if there would be the current one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens a dialogue in which a variable or an expression can be entered , which should be supervised , the monitored value appears in the variable view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you can adapt to your needs and how you can help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; help to become better .
document type Edi@@ ting packages ( DT@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to facilitate support for marking and scrip@@ ting trees ; you can make &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developer , easy to use and productive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; DT@@ EP ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files with the extension .@@ tag@@ . tool@@ bars are handmade , the text and instructions may include faster into a document as a user could ever . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; DT@@ EP ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details on the conversion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool bars . shortly , one &amp; DT@@ EP ; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the content of the properties dial@@ ogs , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the day shows a fast inser@@ tion of tags in a document without any danger of a typ@@ ew@@ rit@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tag folder are nothing but folders . they contain only the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder enter the name of the description language and version , so available . ( for example , ht@@ ml @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declar@@ es whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many users a better insight and more information when working with them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following chapter describes every element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations are explained in a simple manner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the root element of an Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but only contains the definition of many tags and nothing else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
type of tags is a script function . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid for the day of day class . the name of the basic class for this class . ( only family 2 )
valid for the type Method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if yes , the day has a common bond attributes and the attributes within this tags may be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag , which is an element of element . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; describes a attribute of a tags . this element can only indicate the name and type of attribute . additionally , there are more tags to describe how this attribute is to be displayed as this attribute is to be displayed , etc ; This is a only element type element . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speci@@ fies the source codes for the attributes used in tag Edi@@ tor@@ dialog , and in the attribute tree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p methodology within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used for achieving the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and method@@ ological name . the arguments to be handed over to the method . can be blank or % day name % that means the name of the current tags .
a b@@ bin @-@ tag group@@ ed with the elements of a list . it can occur for an attribute description only once . it is a only element type element .
speci@@ fies the attributes of a tags within a dialogue . this day can occur only once in a dialogue ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present in the dialog for every field ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is there a list of elements that may be defined within the defined tags , this element is an element type . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is there a list of elements that end a day . this element is an element type . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all Tag@@ XML files must start with one &amp; XML ; output : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 @-@ 8 ? &gt; and have to be cha@@ ined and closed properly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; space indicates nothing but watch &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and , particularly in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; can &apos;t be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog on top at &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to launch and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this function is not currently available . currently the check takes place when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; diagram &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; sch@@ ema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ as tag . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP will be described . the file name of this Tag@@ XML file is to be over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .@@ tag . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; vo@@ id &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &gt; &quot; _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is as fairly simple and there is a editor that can be edited using DT@@ D . for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; should be done with the following entries : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&#91; general &#93; Version = User de 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 transi@@ tional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Tran@@ si@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
a action can be set up with settings ... created . click on New Action to the same dialog :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this added action is assigned a ke@@ yp@@ ad . with clicking the button , a ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes can be assigned with K@@ einer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the simpl@@ est action . a text can be entered in the detailed settings , and in the execution of the action this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this promotion , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that the document can change or use as input ( or parts of document ) or the various see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ EP@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , the name of the scripts and interpre@@ ter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although qualified paths are allowed is it recommended to use 100 % scrip@@ t@@ dir / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts in the command line :
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file / from the document name is removed .
% p@@ id : is replaced with the PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance is running . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it is used by the external script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the above mentioned methods , a script input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us can be determined on the default input . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; selected text : the selected document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally only with this setting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two kinds of output : error messages which will be displayed on the standard edition , which is set to the default output : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create tags in logical groups . in this case it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add actions and configure promotions . select Settings promotions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window , editing the Edit mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
complete all the necessary fields and add the day to matching tool@@ bar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete everything and , if the day attributes has and you can plan their use , activate dialog &quot; Day , &quot; when available , so you can enter an input when using the action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is this a ugly symbol . who should mem@@ ori@@ ze the action with this symbol ? replace it before we have difficulties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we &amp; k@@ icon@@ edit ; , graphic other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ icon@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select size others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please note that the created symbol does not only help you to mem@@ ori@@ ze what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; DT@@ EP ; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to that the day start , I decided to create a start button . by using green ( green is mostly interpreted as a symbol ) , or at least , a message to the user indicates that clicking on the current document will be inserted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after creating the symbol , it must be associated with the action . this happens through the menu with Settings promotions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choose the folder where the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; press the button and continue with other tags , so there is or confirm or confirm with OK . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suppose you want to add some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; functions to tool@@ bar , or set it for better overview through several parti@@ tions . open the tool@@ bar and select the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to select the separ@@ ator ( at the top left ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds a tool@@ bar to the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , I would like to have a quick possibility to access the kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please note how the separ@@ ator does not know the group@@ ing . one who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar , could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button is the opposite of the start button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by try all symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you don &apos;t exist in the right folder , it will be your regular folder , but your tool@@ bars ( s ) should be stored in the proper folder , so that their tool@@ bar must be loaded ( s ) if a file is opened from the appropriate type . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the most not@@ e@@ worthy extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or form@@ atting language you like . that &apos;s why I describes this chapter in my personal use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; - Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory , if somebody has done it for you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two parts in this process . first you need to create a existing documentation for the form@@ atting / script / etc . , then you have to let the doc@@ r@@ c file . we will then let the second part we will deal with you here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
# K@@ DE Configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path @-@ file , relative to this file ; e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index ( e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # 2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ ht@@ ml ) = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ ht@@ ml
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation is something like :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level of the top element = PHP 4.2 . PHP 4.2 = Table of Cont@@ ents , # G@@ etting Star@@ ents = Basic Reference = Basic Reference = Basic Reference = Basic Reference = Basic Reference = Basic Reference = Basic Reference = Basic Reference = Basic Reference = Basic Reference = Basic Reference = Basic Reference = Basic Reference = Basic Reference = Basic ...
note that # before G@@ etting starts and Language Reference . that shows that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with private contents . there is no known limit for the box @-@ depth ( except by reason ) m@@ das@@ h ; but try it out .
it is refer@@ enced that the table of contents will be refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and visi@@ bly at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ das@@ h ; folder shown ! ) .
spaces don &apos;t affect anything but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; res@@ sources .
this section is to be displayed in the doc@@ r@@ c file that is used to display the context of context @-@ sensitive help . for example when writing a &amp; PHP ; -@@ scripts the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fet@@ ch _ array functions would be displayed . there are only two types of records here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and file binding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a simple list of scre@@ ed separate context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now you can save your file doc@@ r@@ c or save it according to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / dev / qu@@ anta / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / directory for local or global use . then create a folder ( like doc@@ r@@ c ) and copy your HTML documentation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are sure that these good and worth are shared , please send your doc@@ r@@ c files to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; community . they will not be rich toward the best web development platform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the res@@ ett@@ ling resources ( DT@@ EP packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or else who will send you an email , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the scripts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all the other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; users are checked and only available when our team needs them as correct and useless for publication where it will be available for our team as well as for later users . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when loading , you will be asked for your personal GP@@ G key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase will not be saved ) , or in the case you have several keys you can leave a blank ( URL preview can be empty ) and with clicking OK the upload will be started . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the up@@ loading can upload from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package to the tool@@ bar and in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after downloading a resource , still before installation , investig@@ ates &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource has been cau@@ tious . if the integrity is given and the resource can be canc@@ eled , a message appears with the statement of the resource of the resource . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is possible to work on XML languages , which currently does not work by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it may be time consuming because hundreds of day files can be needed in everyday XML format . there is the simpler way to convert DT@@ D to an DT@@ EP package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D charging and conversion of a DT@@ D . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the DT@@ D description that should be used . after that the following dialogue will appear :
objective name : the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type definition page : the string in the ! doc@@ type tag as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC - / / W3@@ C / / DT@@ D / / DT@@ D / / DT@@ D / / ISO / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d should be released
fine setting of DT@@ EP after the conversion : when activated , leads &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after conversion the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; it is recommended to use the details of the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this option .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , there are some key concepts . to understand this and full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this chapter tries to create exactly these concepts without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; little Ben@@ ef@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the work@@ space in three areas shared : global , locally and projec@@ t@@ related . this distinction applies a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; available , available in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this allows to secure the administr@@ ators different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which is then available in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
local items represent a personal collection of web@@ design for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that it can only use this user personally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these projec@@ t@@ related elements are only available within a certain project . this can be stored within a specific project . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which is the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several major areas : the editing window , the tree views , the boxes with information and the tool@@ bars . please beat in , and for further information on these areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can select the boxes with the right mouse button to re @-@ upload , delete or up@@ loading the document , delete or up@@ loading the document , skip to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the editing area , right @-@ click menu will lead to a further context menu such as basic machining steps ( copy / paste ) , editing the text under the mouse cur@@ sor or open the file , if the string is described under the mouse cur@@ sor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the top end of the editor &apos;s tool@@ bar , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Tran@@ si@@ tional works as a standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is displayed . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the tool@@ bars will be adapted to the new functions and related user needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really light . if they want to insert a single day , e.g. &amp; lt ; then click to insert the data for this just one day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the client views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navigate them to open and through strips . in the representation of boxes , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation Bau@@ man@@ views are available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project management is a powerful tool making &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it displays all files in the project and allows you to manage the files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or delete the files from the storage medium can be added to the context menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another way of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , whole site &amp; etc . there are all options open to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
templates can be divided into three categories in which connection they are used . global templates are always available from the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; working area only available for the respective users and templates in projects are only available in the project . more to templates is available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here you will find information about the available scripts . the concept of incorpor@@ ation in global , local and project works also here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information to a script . via the right mouse buttons there are further functions to edit or send via email . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this view , the internal structure of the active document shows the cur@@ sor in the document on the position of the element . by right click of an element opens a list of commands in terms of navigation and refresh@@ ments of the tree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tree appears among the other tree views . with it , many quickly attributes and nam@@ ing rooms can change the change of all available attributes with few mouse clicks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here &apos;s the complete documentation of the web @-@ technology for your development . you can create their documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you can create your own documentation , and can be edited and reviewed by adding a folder doc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two car@@ ers at the bottom end of the window , can be reached via the used information : the news window and the problem @-@ window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this box shows information about each in Qu@@ anta running script . for example the used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D is displayed .
this box shows all errors in the Mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; scripts that are carried out will give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool@@ bars are extensively developed and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the respective command . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bars is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; sends the tool@@ bar as a com@@ pri@@ zed T@@ ar @-@ Archive by e @-@ mail ; if they can secure it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as any other and load them !
it is reasonable if you want to adapt the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it has a number of options to get to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options available . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems when starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 bin folder . also you should make sure that no older version of &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H in front of her bin folder . same goes for &amp; Q@@ t ;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; optimized for a rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a wide range of powerful functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with a obvious , expandable Mark@@ up @-@ language editor , which would make it an absolutely superb web development tool for &amp; K@@ DE ; so it was done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not longer on pure &amp; HTML ; restricted is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive Web development tool . summar@@ ize : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; therefore the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , to the af@@ ore@@ mentioned claim must be stated that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; K@@ DE ; it &apos;s not only this possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to expand as they need it for their needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; enables web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can expand productivity quickly . by means of self @-@ coated actions , scripts and tool@@ bars . ( read more about it in the program ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for fast web development , quickly converted to a sophisticated editor with many powerful features . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developers have left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more detailed documentation is available with help : / qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter your help or k@@ help@@ center help : / qu@@ anta ) .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time when you open a file , which is not located on it , whereby the oldest entry is taken out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this allows you to save code parts and all files as templates for later use . should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project procedure , only an error is reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; converted when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board , special characters are included in the clip@@ board , allowing them correctly displayed and not understood from the browser as a form@@ atting agent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
converting the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; description which is the correct route to insert special characters and space characters in &amp; URL ; it is primarily used for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s in the anchor day .
switches the block@@ ings to or out . it allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift key .
go directly to a line number . that &apos;s very helpful when your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error messages available !
search a string or regular expression in the selected folder . a type gre@@ p or used with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shows the news window or not on . that &apos;s the window , in which you see the display of scrip@@ ting and de@@ bu@@ gger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
out@@ - and switching @-@ up of the problem at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the main window is activated when it changes to the structure tree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; displays the tool@@ bars from the main window . this column allows you to put book@@ marks with a mouse click . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu with the entries previous or next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sors in the document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
book@@ marks from other open documents appear in the menu according to the file name of the other documents .
opens a existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ projects are stored with the file .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; searches for new files according to new files that could be there . that enables e.g. graphics files to copy files into your project folder , or to add them to the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
downloads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and if you have downloaded further inputs / output modules ( Ki@@ o slaves ) .
settings such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project managed . in Chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Projects you will find the details explained .
does a project tool bar . these are stored in project You / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a dialog to save your tool@@ bars , allows you to select the type of tool@@ bars : local or project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens a dialog to add a new tool bar . this creates only the name . promotions must be saved using tool@@ bar , or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remove a tool@@ bar from the visible area . they do not delete it from the hard disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this you can send their own tool@@ bars to someone ( maybe at the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) . the menu opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endi@@ x .
allows the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server where everyone can access it . see in .
charging a &amp; DT@@ D ; you or anybody else has made it and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format .
invite / refresh the du@@ ti@@ tes from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it is useful to ren@@ ew the entire &amp; DT@@ EP ; if this globally and a write permission is not present in the global K@@ DE file , the shop fails .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar , there is a sub@@ menu standard in the tags menu , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
allows access to the current day setting dialog when there is one . this entry is always available in the menu tags and followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub @-@ menus .
activ@@ ates or disable the smart inser@@ tion of tags . currently it works only with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . intelligent import means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us is ref@@ using when this day is ref@@ usal to contradi@@ ct the rules .
in the plug@@ ins menu the available plug@@ ins are listed below the menu points listed below . click to activate the plug @-@ in plug@@ ins disabled .
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available maps depends on the original ; - version .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the type of line identification . very useful when you know people know the other OS platforms to develop . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D document ; using the external application Ti@@ dy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instant switch@@ over between different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , the switch mode can sometimes need or un@@ beautiful graphics . recommended is the card mode , which is also the default in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub@@ window . using a selection the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
switches the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changes in this dialog will affect any application that use the K@@ HTML @-@ Part , including the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
direc@@ ts the behavior of the editor . in the documentation of &amp; Kate . you can find details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a dialog will appear in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bars or which can change the series . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this should create an help according to the mouse cur@@ sor environment , but is not implemented yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project , developers can always use assistance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed best from above , as after filling out the project name the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will automatically be completed with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties Project Properties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name file is completed automatically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ project file . by default it has the name of the project in lower@@ case letters and without spaces with the extension of web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can access the server address of the machine to which one wants to access the local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exemplary .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the chosen recorder will be an adaptation needed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the folder where templates are stored for the project . it is a rela@@ tional path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be adjusted instead of the standard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the folder where the tool@@ bars can be saved to the project and tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be adjusted instead of the standard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this allows you to add files from the local file system into the project . multiple files , or entire folders can be selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this setting is great if you have static we@@ bin@@ ables which you want to download and change . with ser@@ ene scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc . ) you have to proceed differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hin@@ dered when files , which are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , are supposed to be embedded in a new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this option , all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make an exact selection of good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this displays a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by clicking on or , by removing the tick , cl@@ inging from the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings , which simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can be upload in the menu with project Properties in the menu @-@ window , or with the ke@@ yp@@ ad Shift ; F@@ 7 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some settings correspond to those in the project assist@@ ants and are described in . the additional entries are explained .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholder can be possible ) to re@@ locate the project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; additional option to top , also files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the project view , which will be loaded when opening the project , and can be read more about project views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , the desired de@@ bu@@ gger can be selected . more information about G@@ ub@@ es can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in can be set with the Op@@ tions button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the sub@@ window profiles upload , high loading profiles ( see in ) can be adjusted , as well as the display of a tree view for each profile , displaying a separate building site for each profile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the sub@@ window event configuration you can switch or delete these actions , change or delete events . event actions will be executed if a previously particular event occurs , such as the sick@@ le of a file . see details . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us opens ; the last project that was opened . you cannot currently influence this behaviour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to open another project , select project Open Project ... from the Project Project or the Symbol Project opening up from the tool@@ bar . projects will be displayed and allows selecting a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file will be saved automatically if you want to save changes before leaving , if you want to change changes before leaving , when you download a new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
project management gives access to the files in the project . there you can manage the files in the current project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; folders , however , are missing the entries to open and open with ... using the right mouse @-@ click pop@@ up menu : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , different profiles may be selected . the profile contains information on the location of the upload files . see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; allows to remove the current profile . if only a profile is available , the button is blind@@ ed to prevent removing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the password will keep in the kernel and password . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary , and the rather un@@ secure password on the disk space does not come into question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will stop the transfer , or simply leave the dialogue when you change your opinion of up@@ loading . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , many high loads are created and thus up@@ loading the project ( or parts of the project ) on different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog will display : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the name of server , to which the files should be copied . either a full qualified domain name or an IP address work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
transfer protocol to upload . the list depends on the version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and the installed Ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; file ( local ) and NFS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the port for transfer . usually , this does not need to be changed except the network administrator operates a service not on the usual port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on your anxiety , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a risk . use the password stored on the plate , so it can &apos;t be easily read , but everybody can easily see them in plain text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . it can be loaded into a project that means multiple files and tool@@ bars , and replace the currently open files and tool@@ bars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; views can be saved in the menu or Project Tool@@ bar , accessible via Settings tool tool@@ bar , open or deleted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; with which one has to do most , not only increase productivity but also allows you to adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to its own work@@ places . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; best known about the tool tool@@ bars . use and adding to the Add tool@@ bars will be treated in the section Add tool@@ bars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tool@@ bars and the symbols can be adjusted either via the tool menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which new tool can be set , or can be specified in the dialog where actions can be displayed on this or other tool@@ bars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries of action and action are displayed , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tool@@ bars and actions on them can set up set up in the menu with settings tool@@ bars ... and set settings dialog .. set .
templates are in the main document skel@@ et@@ re , code @-@ schn@@ itz@@ el and files to link . templates are basically suitable as a usual system with extended organisation and interfaces . templates are in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; available in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the restrictions you imagine to the fil@@ esystem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supplied templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the start of each template . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
binary is everything that is not pure text . it can be inserted every file except text , meaning images , &amp; PDF ; binary templates ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples are usually found in the template of global templates . additional information to the templates is available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; documents can be produced by any text type . in the basis of these templates , new documents may be created . you will normally find a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in corresponding ways to be efficiently found . see for more information on templates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this type of templates is useful if not a new document is available on a template but the same text area to be inserted back into the documents . you can find everything from a comment on a complete menu on Javascript or Perl basis . see for more information on templates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the name says , these templates serve for all websites as templates . you are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder hierarchy . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; create a document structure according to exposure ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) and choose file as model save as a local template . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once this has been done , you notice that ( even if it is not saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select text in your document and click on file as a template to save selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily moved with drag and drop to the template . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be done in a template folder , such as drag and drop or inser@@ ting over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can select and secure a folder permission in the file tree or in the project files to create a name for the template , but of course it can be stored as local or global template . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project templates allow a very target @-@ oriented procedure . you can insert the header or foot@@ er and link them with them . additionally , you can shape some things while using templates in projects very deep in mind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the template in the sub @-@ window templates is based on the files laid in $ K@@ D@@ ED@@ IR / share / templates / Templ@@ ates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates /
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to specify the behaviour of a folder , click the right mouse button to click on the folder and select the following dialogue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a drop @-@ down box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is blind@@ ed , once el@@ ter@@ nal attributes is per@@ ple@@ xed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is enabled by default and suitable for everything except the regular folders in the preliminary survey . if nothing appears that it would be explicitly activated in this path . if nothing appears , it is likely to be found in a regular folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permits or sent text for templates in this folder , which could be general header or foot@@ er for all templates for a specific project and allows copying contents into a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , we have the pop@@ up menu ( indicated that mouse button press ) through a full command collection for adding folders , and copy templates from one place to another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ editor and V@@ PL ; source code editor in two parts : the editor @-@ editor will replace the source code in two parts : the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; Editor .
the V@@ PL ; Editor is working as follows : it invites a document as a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and switch to the source code editor in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; Editor on a document , the &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; source code . there is no plans to change this behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second mode works just like the first , except that at the same time the changes are activated in the source code editor and in V@@ PL ; the ke@@ yst@@ ander will be activated from a window to others , whereby the position in the document is maintained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; Editor , and the source code editor can be set up automatically via Settings Qu@@ anta . in principle it can be set between synchron@@ ization after a click or automatic . basically , the recommendation applies : a small pot for fast calcul@@ ator and a large pot for slow motion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suppose you want to change the title of the web page , so it is possible to select document characteristics when a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor you can change the following document by the V@@ PL ; this allows you to change the following : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself , e.g. keywords for internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added by pressing the two buttons below or removed . a click into the list allows the change of the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword number 2 on the contents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CSS rules are the new way of designing of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules using the list , just as with the met@@ a @-@ elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is possible to include an external CSS style template , pressed onto the file button and select the corresponding file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of the cur@@ sors is as usual in a text processing , by means of arrows , possible . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and deleted by R@@ AN@@ TA@@ ST@@ E or Rem@@ net@@ aste . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inser@@ tion of tags is made in the same way via the tool@@ bars , as in the source code editor , it is necessary to insert tags previously available already existing tags or any other surrounding anchor must be removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some tool@@ bars like the tables assistant or the lists @-@ assistant are disabled . they are later used in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists will need to be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the examination of style sheets . in contrast to other programs for style sheets the search for certain elements is possible and the design of the style template can be followed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to comp@@ ile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; you need to comp@@ ile , except &amp; K@@ DE ; still the lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are available at a typical installation by &amp; K@@ DE ; already available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; halt in a template , on a place in a x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g loaded style or x@@ ml file or on the current node . new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db Comp@@ ati@@ bility mode can be set to wai@@ ver reference points in a specified file and line number and be activated later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the complete path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without a path name . fil@@ en@@ ame on the same folder as the upper@@ most loaded style template to work folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g Is the following entry possible :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this command , it is checked on a partial or entire agreement with a pre@@ age called my@@ ME or a specified mod@@ us@@ ername , which matches the string template with any QNAP NAS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP ME &quot; will be added according to the rules of the X@@ SL : test@@ 1 is used and updated ; extended to htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a modified storage point must be dissolved for the associated UR@@ I and line number . this is automatically re@@ done when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . mounting points are re@@ examined shortly after starting every run .

&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a program for bug@@ ging ( de@@ bug ) in X@@ SL style sheets ( X@@ SL = Exten@@ sible Styl@@ es@@ he@@ et Language ) . it has similar commands like the Unix / Linux de@@ bu@@ gger g@@ db . there are three ways to perform a style template :
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g --@@ moun@@ ts ; --@@ par@@ am &amp; lt ; NA@@ ME@@ gt ; -- long &amp; lt ; NA@@ ME@@ gt ; --@@ output &amp; lt ; NA@@ ME@@ gt ; --@@ output &amp; lt ; --@@ verb@@ ose --@@ incre@@ d@@ 8@@ input --@@ end@@ f@@ 8@@ input --@@ refresh + X@@ SL@@ Source + X@@ ML@@ Data
start a shell . enter the &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; command &quot; help &quot; to get an overview of the help .
includes the parameter with the name &amp; lt ; NA@@ ME@@ gt ; and the value &amp; lt ; V@@ AL@@ U@@ E@@ gt ; and V@@ AL@@ U@@ E@@ gt ; add to the X@@ SL ambient variable . see also the documentation of the &quot; add@@ par@@ am &quot; command .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; takes the conversion 20 times when the --@@ repeat is specified , the conversion will be made 100 times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
input documents are treated as HTML files when the support has been activated in lib@@ x@@ ml .
activ@@ ates X@@ Inclu@@ de processing of input document if the support has been activated in lib@@ x@@ ml . this is the default .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on systems with installed Read@@ line library , you can use the arrow keys on / off through the commands to date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several commands require more than one argument . quotes can be used to set up phr@@ ases as an argument . &amp; quot ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; &quot; set .
Templ@@ ate _ NA@@ ME : a valid name of a template that consists of the ASCII characters 0x@@ 00 to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a fully qualified name like &quot; X@@ SL : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name . &quot;
fil@@ en@@ ame : a valid local file name on the user &apos;s system . on Uni@@ x@@ - or Cy@@ g@@ win systems the name is allowed to have the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; as a short form for the personal folder . on R@@ IS@@ C @-@ OS systems are also allowed .
P@@ AT@@ H : a path to change the work folder . on some operating systems the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; will be replaced by the path to your personal folder .
data : the XML @-@ data or XML _ document being processed by the style template . see also &amp; lt ; FI@@ LE@@ NA@@ ME@@ gt ; and &amp; lt ; UR@@ I@@ ts ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; running time commands : { bye _ BAR _ exit _ BAR _ quit } , step , step@@ Up , step@@ down , next , continue , run , trace , set@@ list , options &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are many graphical tools for compar@@ ing . so why &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 , let me explain why I wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the merge was very complicated , because one of the workers had undertaken many changes at the same time . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I couldn &apos;t see what exactly changed within these lines . and there was no clu@@ es to the places where maybe only the revers@@ al had changed . the merge of these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , could display differences within a row and changes to white signs . later , a lot of other useful functions were added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , if you would like to compare quickly text , simply copy it into the clip@@ board and add it to one of the comparison window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ ing and merge of folders . this function transformed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , almost into a fully @-@ fle@@ dged file browser . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also 3 @-@ way assemb@@ ling is fully supported . this is useful when two persons work independently of one piece of codes and changes the original file . in this editor , you can even edit the result . the screenshot shows three source files when merge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; diff@@ 3 ; also helps you with the same and merge full folder . this screen photo shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder merge :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; diff@@ 3 ; displaying the exact differences and close the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you have to check co@@ ats , you will like this function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; differences in white signs and tab@@ s are displayed visi@@ bly . if the lines differ in a certain number of white characters , you can see it at a glance at the column on the left side . ( no trouble is changing . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a file is equal , and the other differs in a row , then the color indicate which file is different . red color means that both can differ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if all files are in the same name , but in different folders , you can make the Ti@@ p@@ par@@ work by writing only the file name of the first file . for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
diff@@ 3 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 folder with folder 3 folder and folder 3 folder
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Open dialog allows manual inser@@ tion of file names , select the selection via the file browser ( file ... ) or select a last open file from the list box . you must not leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files will be executed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also select a folder via the button . if you select a folder , then you use the same or merge files for B and C , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when mer@@ ging it , the input field is active and cannot be processed . however , it is not necessary to specify an output file immediately afterwards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the set @-@ up button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before starting with the same / merge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . the comparison starts immediately . in the open dialog , you will not need to select files , you can easily connect the dialog button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from a editor , and let it fall over a comparison window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what thought is behind it ? sometimes contains a file , e.g. several similar functions . if you need to figure out what these functions are , they would need to compare and compare these functions . now , you may need to copy the relevant sections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
note : currently you can remove anything from &amp; diff@@ 3 ; only the text of text is supported in a comparison window .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warning : some editors interpret the pulling and placing text into another program as cutting and inser@@ tion ( instead of copying and paste ) , in such a case your original data could not be lost . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the upper part of each text box is the info @-@ line . ( note that window C is optional ) . ( note the mouse is optional ) . ( if the path is too long for a file , let the mouse make a bit over the line . then , a little relief window will display the full name . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three source tree species are assigned letters A , B and C . A. has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a difference is detected , the color is different . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( merge ) good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; links to the text indicates the merge column . when differences were found , the column displays the corresponding color . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with some programming languages the color is not so important . ( C / C + + , e.g. , white signs are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre @-@ processor and in a few , rare cases relevant . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vertical line , which separates the merge column from the text , is interrupted at the places where the respective source file is dotted , the line on broken lines is represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result window ( below the comparison bars ) also has an Info line with the wording output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the text file . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts dis@@ solves is save down@@ lighted ! ! ! ( use the buttons to find next dissolved / un@@ resolved conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only two compar@@ es are used , each difference is also to be solved manually at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will not be visible . it will be highlighted by the color background color for the current area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , through the automatic merge or by manual editing no further line is left ; no line in the source code . this text will be displayed neither in the final stored file , nor in a marking that you may copy and paste them elsewhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the text &amp; lt ; merge conve@@ x ; however , appears in the clip@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . go careful with this function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : when selecting the sources you can ignore and ignore the options numbers or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; navigate primarily with the picture profiles and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are used in one of the windows , si@@ f as you can use it from other programs , si@@ f as you can also use it from other programs to navigate by clicking also to navigate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the eye window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the insert button you can switch between insert and over@@ writing mode . ( default is the insert mode . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a click with the left mouse button in one of the summar@@ ies columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows at the beginning of the respective group ( as already mentioned in the merge and edi@@ table settings ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons to navigate to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous step ( tr@@ l @-@ down / tr@@ l @-@ image reverse ) or to the next / previous un@@ solved conflict as conflict . therefore , between sol@@ vable and un@@ solved conflicts has to be distinguished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to copy the marking in the clip@@ board , you need to copy the copying button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or Str@@ g @-@ insert ) . if this option is activated , then you will be able to automatically copy the contents of the clip@@ board by mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; line files are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system . Unix flavors are using a line @-@ forward code \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use the line @-@ up of the source files , that is why you should use &amp; diff@@ 3 ; neither with binary files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the options and list of the most recently used files will be automatically saved and restored at the next start . ( menu adju@@ dic@@ ation - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 set up ... )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choose a script with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog displays fonts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use it . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you enable this option , differences will be displayed in ital@@ ics . if the chosen document does not support this display , nothing happens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be tra@@ pped automatically . on these systems , the button will automatically create an odd colour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this option is checked , when pressing the tab button the appropriate number of spaces is inserted . otherwise , a tab character is inserted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you press input or return , the default line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this option is checked , you will automatically copy any selection into the clip@@ board . it will be able to copy manually into the clip@@ board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can select which line type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly common selection on the used operating system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when compar@@ ing files is tried &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all completely identical lines can be ignored in the source files . only during this first step , white signs are ignored . in this step , white signs are ignored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a carriage back sign &apos; \ &apos; on the end of one line , but then they could save files with different sizes on the side @-@ side @-@ compare comparison . if this option is checked , this option must be disabled . in default , this option is down@@ lighted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in default , this option is down@@ lighted . in the first part of the analysis numbers and related characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; ) are ignored , but they are treated like white signs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in default this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white signs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inten@@ sively for even smaller differences . the option is activated in default and large files , but slowly with very large files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in automatic shift mode , this setting determines how long the results will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
solves automatic all conflicts in white signs by using the chosen file as a source code . ( default is manual selection . if you need this only from time to time ) if the automatic selection may also be used in numbers or comments if the options are ignor@@ ing or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments are enabled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these options are treated in the chapter for scanning , folders and announ@@ c@@ ements . check for details below documentation for directory comparison and merge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a file is stored and an older version is already existing , then the original version is used with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
adap@@ ts to the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current running program . they need to finish and restart the change . ( this option is active in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is connected to the control centre . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following code settings can be adjusted separately for each entry . if you activated this option , all entries are used for all entries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the code for coding is a short note , which is the local en@@ coding . ( this can not be changed here and has a purely informal character . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adjust the file coding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted , as the coding for each file can be individually adjustable , can even be compared with different en@@ coding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which code to save is used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they may not work with your code@@ c . ( e.g. , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the pre @-@ processing command can only be set with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
turn this off to supp@@ ress the changes of changes in white signs in text or review ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignor@@ ing or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments are enabled . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this selection is only available when you compare three files . but in normal mode , all differences in colour coded over@@ si@@ ren@@ al column are displayed ; C , A &amp; B ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; C ; C or B &amp; B ; it will be displayed next to the normal still a second over@@ si@@ ft column with the required information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen , for long lines . simply drop the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arran@@ ges the comparison windows next to each other or over@@ lap . this can also be useful to display long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , look at the differences and then decide freely to merge the files . a simple click starts to merge the merge file as default for the file name . ( if this function is used to restart the merge re@@ file , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when reading a file it is first presented to this external command . in &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use this function as for removing distur@@ bing parts or for correct inser@@ tion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when reading a file it is specified first to this external command ( see above ) , then the output of the command is specified only at the line of the command . each input line must have an associated edition line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thought behind it is to allow users more flexibility when setting the di@@ ff results . but for this , an external program is needed , and most users would not want to program the good news . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while experim@@ enting experim@@ enting , you might begin to understand it , and perhaps like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs to support very similar things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ignor@@ ing numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre@@ set command for line off right . &quot; s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Each sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a match , and each hits will be replaced by nothing , so quasi deleted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , you might want to perform several arguments at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the arguments from each other . example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of used you can also use something different like per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / replacement / switch &quot; Ho@@ wever , per@@ l needs some details other . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) are needed . for example : \ \ &apos; . example :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the data after the normal @-@ processor are maintained for the display and to merge . the further operations only change data , which sees the line @-@ like Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ off @-@ processor can see the output of the normal pre@@ process as input . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pre @-@ processor commands are very useful , but as in any function , the text changes or differences hidden , you acci@@ dentally notice certain differences and destroy important data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; often , programm@@ ers need to edit many files in a folder . this is why you can compare and merge full folders with &amp; diff@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
... making a proposal for each object ; you can adjust the proposal before the launch .
... can simul@@ ate the merge and depic@@ ts the simul@@ ated changes without it truly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; exec@@ utes selected actions with all selected objects ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is similar to the compar@@ ative and merge of individual files , and you only need to open a folder to the command line or in the dialog file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if three folders are collected , then folder 1 is used as a basis . if no target folder was given , and k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note that only the comparison of folders will automatically start the merge . to select the merge , you need to select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 button . ( further details follow . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the reading of the folder you will inform you a little news window on current progress . if you lose the folder , only the files are listed , which are compared to then . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when scanning the folder is completed , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each file and each folder was found during the scan , is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the folder structure is normally represented together . you can open a folder , click on the + / - click on or by clicking the arrow keys on the left / right , or open all sub@@ directories with which you can open and fold all the folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you click on a file , the file comparison starts and it appears a comparison window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detailed window to the selected object . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as shown in the above picture , the colors of red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in identical entries , the colour is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; folders are considered identical when their total content is identical . then , folders have the same color . with folders the age is ir@@ relevant for its colour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow becomes and later when it is old is red . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the goal if it exists ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; A and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the goal if it exists ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the goal if it exists ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; A , B and C cannot have the same file type ( e.g. if a file and B is a file ) : bug : contra@@ dic@@ tory data types . as long as such faulty objects exist , the merge cannot be started . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A file and B is a file ) : bug : contra@@ dic@@ tory data types . as long as such faulty objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mode for syn@@ cing is active if only two folders and no explicit response file specified , then cho@@ oses &amp; diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
... A and B do not exist but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user can see as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; right after the merge file only B ; B after A. )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when two folders are re@@ directed and activated the new file instead of merge ( uns@@ af@@ e ) is activated , but the date indicates , but the date will not be removed , but the date will not be removed . if such errors are not removed , the merge of the folders will not be started . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the merge , a file is finished after the other . it &apos;s Status column shows that if the merge is successful , and in accordance with other messages , you should make a final review and see if the status is OK . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if in setup dialog the file compar@@ ative analysis is chosen , K@@ diff@@ 3 will display other columns , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for sol@@ vable conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or consolidated . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you may collect either the selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all entries ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please note : if you do not have any target folders , it will be used as a target in the three @-@ folder merge mode and to synchron@@ ize A and / or B as a target . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries can be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options to be ski@@ pped in the folder structure . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to merge all entries : select directory directory / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key short@@ cut ) : select the action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you still exist without contra@@ dic@@ tory data types , a message appears on the incorrect elements . you can then select a valid promotion for them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you merge all entries , a dialog window appears with the options to run , simul@@ ate and break down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you only want to see , if you would like to see what would happen , you will receive a detailed list of all actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; diff@@ 3 ; then carries certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( merge into a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( see the screenshot ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you &apos;re done with a file , select or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t stored , a corresponding dialog will appear . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 will continue his work with the next story . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; on an error , there will be a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you can try to try another action for the entry or solve the problem in any other way before you proceed to merge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if some entries were group@@ ed individually , these entries are not included in the current session . even if you change these entries , these entries are not included in the future . only if you change the merge operation , these entries are re@@ group@@ ed again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 set up ... ) has now a section called directory @-@ merge with these options :
only files that fit onto the specified pattern can be displayed in the element tree . separate the pattern using a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; you can see the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on . the default is * .@@ file must not match this pattern .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree . there can be more than one pattern to be entered . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree . there can be more than one pattern to be entered . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
ignore files that would also be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ matic created files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this folder is specific with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file system files have a default attribute . in other file systems a previous score is selected . this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not . this option is in default .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared if the option is switched on , the files are compared to which the links show . this is down@@ lighted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the option is switched off when the option is switched off , the links are treated like normal folders and repeat recur@@ sively . ( note that the link will be treated like normal folders and cras@@ hes correctly . ) This option is shut down in default . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a complete analysis of each file through and shows the statisti@@ c columns . ( the number of sol@@ vers , un@@ el@@ o@@ ily and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and essentially slower when it is applied to files that do not contain any text . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you compare great folder to a slow network , it may be faster to compare the change date and the file size . if you use caution , this option is down@@ cast off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar to the chan@@ ges@@ et date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical , when copying the chan@@ ges@@ tion date . please be careful when copying the chan@@ ges@@ tion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activ@@ ating the synchron@@ izing mode when two folders are compared and no target folders are given , and the results of the merge files are identical . this option is shut down in both folders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are differences , the copy of the newer file is proposed as action . ( this is considered to be in@@ secure when the other file is not also modified . ) This option is not shut down in any case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a file or folder will be replaced or deleted , then the original version will be renamed . if an old backup file is already existing with the .@@ original extension , this will also affect the merge of all files . this option is enabled in default . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normally , the file assemb@@ ling view remains visible to the merge of individual files ; you can switch the window cap@@ ers with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want to switch the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ click . yet , you can also merge a single file from the merge menu . as soon as you save the file , the status will run directly and the file will not be enabled if you restart the folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this status is lost when you re @-@ read the directory again : list the list menu : new &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of Ki@@ o @-@ slaves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders to open on local or remote host@@ els .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has another syntax as local files and folders . a few things you should consider :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a path can be relatively , or .. included . it is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blank - &gt; % 20 , etc . for example has a file with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the used protocol . it follows a short list of limitations : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or it may not be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then , a file is adopted as a link target . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no way to edit appro@@ vals or modification date . ( note that this option is only possible with local files . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main reason is currently being used as a differences in currency . Dev@@ ils start first to start the built @-@ in differences . to start K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button via the differences viewer , then select In K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally you need &amp; diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . if it is applied as a part file . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file should exist . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the kon@@ quer@@ or you can select from a patch file and select from the text menu preview in - K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part . besides , this does not work if the original files have changed since creation of the patch file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if &amp; diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the same of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . the merge or the same of folders is not supported in the K@@ part mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now it &apos;s complicated ) , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 has already pointed out that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been using GPL programs for a long time , and I learned a lot while visiting the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers who have walked this way or let him go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have compiled the program from sources and to configure the configure script using the configure script in / us@@ r / local but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resource for user interfaces ( e. g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find more information on this topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are used first and not identical , but if only one non @-@ white characters is used , this is the line as not identical to each other , this is the case that is O@@ FT@@ EN the case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the editor will notice each difference in the files where it begins and where it ends . however , this important information is lost because the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create an extra @-@ file format that could save this information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effort was so far too big . you can always restore a particular version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text , another editor should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after removing text is suddenly washed ; no sr@@ c notes , and the text can &apos;t be removed . what does this mean and how can that be removed ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors to highlight differences . even more her@@ eby would be confused and l@@ acks the purpose . please use another editor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you very much !
to be able to use all functions of &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.1 or later .
information about how to use K@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE you can find on the homepage .
a list of the latest changes you can find under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source package .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to comp@@ ile and install on a system with &amp; K@@ DE ; use the following command at the base folder of the &amp; cl@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir indicates the folder in your system , in which K@@ DE is installed . if you are uns@@ af@@ e , you will find further details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you should not have problems in comp@@ iling , please tell the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ mailing lists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cut out ( Str@@ g @-@ X or r@@ sch@@ alt @-@ removing ) into the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert the text from the clip@@ board at the current cur@@ sor position or replaces the current marking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only differences : files that are identical in all folders are not shown in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in the current program version , you need to re @-@ read the folders using the function Update . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only entries are displayed , the differences are not included in the target files . if the target folders are not able to merge into the target folders . ( the behaviour will probably be modified in a later program version . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please note the buttons to select the source with the lab@@ eling A , B and C below the menu bar . if you are attached to one of the selected group in the result window ( if the lines already exist ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed by clicking on the button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in default , this option is down@@ lighted . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white signs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a preview of all virtual working areas . it is quite practical to shift the running programs on the working areas , to finish it or move them . this works both inside a desktop and in several . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual fields and display applications , and applications can be selected and can be moved on desktop and desktop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved inside &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . movement is possible both inside a desktop and other work surfaces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Con@@ text menu depends on how the right mouse clicks is cli@@ cked , if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; however , the context menu is only cli@@ cked on the empty background and the entries to maxim@@ ize , maxim@@ ize , on desktop and end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . appears only when cli@@ cked on one application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . will only appear when cli@@ cked on one application .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this check box is marked , windows within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager can be moved with the middle button on the desktop and can be moved to other areas of work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when this field is crossed it will appear in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the name of the virtual work space is shown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crossing this field lets the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager to display the numbers of virtual work areas . if it is displayed with name , the names will be provided with file numbers , &amp; cover ; 1 . desktop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this field is crossed off is the background of any desktop as background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this field is crossed , the current programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; only the empty spaces are shown to enable their selection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here &apos;s the view of the program window . simple displays the window with its standard symbol and pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here you can see the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; classic leaves &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; included in a 2x@@ n grid ; horizont@@ ally shows all virtual working areas in a vertical line that is very good for displaying sides on the desktop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager Mini@@ atures in the Control bar . it has the advantage that it can display and move in size , the windows as symbols or with its content . moreover , it runs outside the Control bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
click the Right button to set up in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and followed by sel@@ ector switch ... lets the dialog settings appear .
currently this cannot be changed in the dialog box . you can do this manually :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or V@@ I. If you do not apply to your system administrator or opt @-@ in to your system administrator . in this file , you must enter the key wind@@ ow@@ transparency mode and assign a value to this file : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
da &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package base k@@ de@@ base is required to install the K@@ DE basic package .

&amp; Kitt@@ y ; is a screen lu@@ pe . you can use with &amp; k@@ mag ; a part of the screen should be used as if you want to read a bit of the screen so as if you want to read a bit of the screen . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; kis@@ ses ;
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanding at new functions . it is optimised for use on powerful computers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you start &amp; flash , a window appears as shown above . the window appears as a magni@@ fying window . in the following this window appears as a magni@@ fying window . in the following this window displays the screen window and is referred to as a selection window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the default setting , the mouse is enlarged like a moving magni@@ fying glass . alternatively , you can set a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( screen mode ) or the area of the mouse cur@@ sor at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to avoid the mouse cur@@ sor in the enlarged window , please note that the mouse cur@@ sor is displayed . please note that the mouse cur@@ sor is not able to recognize the form of the mouse cur@@ sor . this is always the standard K@@ DE ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ cur@@ sor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the selection mode , you can adjust the selection window to your needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; move the mouse cur@@ sor in the magni@@ fication window and hold the left mouse button , so you can drop the contents of the enlar@@ ging window and move it with the arrow keys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you additionally use the &amp; Shift key , click or the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the drop window will remain and only move the lower right corner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; likes ; possesses a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer to insert in a file ( to insert it later into other applications ) to turn the picture and much more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; starts and stops the update of the display . stopping the updating , that the required CPU time is about 0 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the Update Rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , H@@ och , Very high ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this mode a selection window will appear . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Kitt@@ y ; uses your introduced Quick commands to save files , open a new window , print , re@@ load ( with the button document re@@ load in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and susp@@ ici@@ ans &amp; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as well known as &amp; c@@ ud@@ fier ; it is a screen saver . for this purpose you can use a magni@@ fying glass to enlarge the small @-@ printed in a newspaper or photo . this application is used for different people of use : from research or artist to a web designer or visually han@@ dic@@ apped .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can use the pain caused by clicking the mouse to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you can consult your computer without pain using the use of your computer . unfortunately , you should consult a doctor if this is not done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to make it clear : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is able to avoid pain caused by clicking on the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse as well . and as with all ergonomic auxiliary means : the result can fall differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and runs a mouse click away as soon as you stop the movement shortly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the intelligent comp@@ action activ@@ ator , power &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; move it until the end of the mouse is done . in this way you can run the drag on pressed mouse button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sof@@ ten@@ ing time has to be ri@@ fied after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; click a mouse click .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the box is switched on , the shooting down time ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here the time of the mouse is shut up , before the mouse is released again , when the mouse is delayed again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this function is enabled by clicking on the right and back , followed by a break by clicking on right and back , followed by a break by clicking on the right mouse button . a slow eclip@@ se left and return a double click . such movements are started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .@@ txt for the first time , but can be changed later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the sound is delayed , you can move &amp; K@@ DE ; to reduce the response time . open the sound system and watch the tab . there is a slide sound buffer that you can set up a lower value to sh@@ orten the response times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started ; this feature is currently only available at &amp; K@@ DE ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other windows environments . at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments please check out how to start a program automatically .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; set all settings the values back when opening the dialog box . have you already pressed the button to use , the settings are reset to the latest press of users . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , initially using the pres@@ ets . in particular , you should leave the intelligent blocking . if you have used to automatically push the intelligent mouse click later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use the audible click , it may be necessary to reduce the response times by &amp; K@@ DE ; at sounds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first you should consci@@ ously make yourself a mouse click without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on locations in the browser window , which does not show any link . you can therefore use the mouse to such places until you want to use them again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when your mouse falls off , you should clean your mouse . that &apos;s usually quite simple . the trick is that you don &apos;t just clean the mouse balls but also the rolls that touch the mouse ball . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first you have to remove the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse is different from mouse to mouse . however , it should be clear when you look at the under@@ side of the mouse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the roles in which the ball was used . you can easily scra@@ pe off the ball with a flat blade or the finger@@ nail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in very rare situations the operating system breaks the design of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , if you have just started moving away , meaning that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool does not mean any more by rele@@ asing the mouse button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; move under another window manager and move a window .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the solution for this problem is that you can carry out a mouse click . herein , the status of &amp; k@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will be restored and you can work as usual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
problem : when you enter text you try and k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cur@@ sor to another place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor there , where you want to have it . but you can &apos;t use the mouse on a neutral area of desktop if you don &apos;t want to bring it out . safe zones for the mouse cur@@ sor are useless , the gray surfaces around the tool@@ bars and the cover lines from windows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to work with intelligent comp@@ action , but I do not create it to edit text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intelligent shifting is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and it takes its time before you can cope with it . however , it is probably possible to put it into the clip@@ board or to insert it once again . here are some advice to do that : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not use the intelligent blocking , if you just start using it &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; insert text as you like , while you move the mouse cur@@ sor to the other end of the text and click here again the mouse button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will always use the audible mouse click . thus , the mouse button is pressing a sound like a mouse click . then you can use the intelligent comp@@ ress even without the audible mouse click . but this requires some practice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to be able , the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X window should be installed . that should be the case on most systems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the functionality of the audible mouse is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers , which are set up properly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; enters the mouse button once the mouse cur@@ sor is short @-@ har@@ dy . this program has been developed for people who suffer the R@@ SI syndrome and the actu@@ ating of the mouse buttons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so that a certain time is waiting for a pulling @-@ off process , before the mouse is let go . in this way the drag and tear with the mouse can be performed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&amp; mouth ; is a program with the dum@@ b user can let their computer speak for themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , a mute users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list of conver@@ sations sentences , which should be said again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the first page of the wiz@@ ard ( left screen photo ) , enter the command which will be used later for the voice output text . further details can be found in the description of the setup dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the second hand , select the default text editor . you can often choose text passages without typ@@ ing them . the passages of text can be processed naturally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the third page ( right screenshot ) , you determine the dictionary of the selected language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can read the words lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only properly sp@@ elled words will be taken into the wording . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main window of &amp; mouth ; is clearly arranged and includes an input field for the keyboard hub of your sentences ( the lower white field on the screen photo ) and a se@@ wage memory of the already spoken phr@@ ases ( the upper white field on the screen photo ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have k@@ mouth ; you can enter the sentences in the input field , which you want to hear . each spoken sentence is attached to the running memory . you can select it sentences which should be spoken again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the setup dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialogue contains two flas@@ h@@ cards , voice output and settings , page Wor@@ ter@@ eph@@ emer@@ al and the page K@@ TT@@ SD card . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the input field of the voice card , enter the command to call the voice generator . in the box below the input field you specify the string character , with text to the language generator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; mouth ; knows two kinds to pass the lyrics . select the check box when the text should be shared as a standard input to the language generator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed as parameters . you can use the following plac@@ eholder : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the command on speech conversion depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation to your language generator . examples for this you will find in the App@@ endi@@ x . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a voice service you will use as a voice service to add the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD card . if this is successful we will be able to use a standardized interface for voice output and that is currently in use in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the first drop down option after selecting a text passage , you will specify what action is triggered by the list of text in the Text passage menu or in the list of text formats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the selection of so@@ fort , the chosen text passage will be inserted directly and in addition to the selection of in the input field the chosen text passage will initially only be entered into the input field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the second selection box closing the editing window , you can define whether the text editor will be automatically saved when closing the editing window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the selection of text editor book , the book will be saved . if you want to check changes , the text box file will not be saved . ask if the text box will be saved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the page Wor@@ ter@@ eph@@ emer@@ al contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the wording . in the main window in addition to the input field indicates &amp; C@@ mouth ; a selection box , if this list allows you to select more than a dictionary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the buttons on the right , you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add them to a file . below the list you can set the name and select the language for the dictionary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this source , select the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reading the words of the individual words can simply compare the word list with Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , in order to include only properly written words into the new dictionary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth , then asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries should be summar@@ ised , and how they are weigh@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this option you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth . automatically add the words into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary in the course of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main scope of the window for editing text compass books is two divided . in the upper part the text box books are displayed as a tree structure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the bottom part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change only its name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to add actions such as new text passages or books or delete selected text passages and books , you can either reach the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or a drop @-@ up menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the order of text editor books or text passages , you can change through drag with the mouse to the new position or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chosen text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of memory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chosen text is copied to the clip@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of memory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the currently active proposition is spoken . if text is located in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected phr@@ ases of dec@@ ei@@ ves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this menu entry is crossed with buttons for frequently used commands , the tool@@ bar is placed directly under the menu bar . by mouse click on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool bar can be moved to another place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this menu entry is crossed , there is a narrow glue in the lower part of the main window with clu@@ es about the condition of &amp; k@@ mouth ; indicated , if not crossed , this status bar is hidden . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this menu entry is crossed , a post@@ p@@ able bar code with entries will be displayed . by mouse click on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool bar can be moved to another place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
probably you have entered the command for voice output not properly or not complete . open settings box ; open the page General Settings and specify the command for voice recording on the voice card . ( see setting dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for further details . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Festival is a language edition of the Edinburgh University . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are currently supported . the license allows you to use the festival for free and without restrictions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that festival is installed in the folder / us@@ r / local / festival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Free@@ TTS is a written voice generator . currently he only supports English language versions . the license allows to use Free@@ TTS for free and distribute it without limitations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , Free@@ TTS is installed in the folder / us@@ r / local / fre@@ eroll , with one of the three following commands : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the third example , the data must be switched on as standard input . ( this is the recommended example of Free@@ TTS application ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ ec@@ ars into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to insert text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our example , Ha@@ de@@ fax is used to convert German text in Phon@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assum@@ ption that Ha@@ de@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA in / us@@ r / local / mb@@ ro@@ la are installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , Ha@@ de@@ fax likes the final sign of the text so that additional signal needs to be added . the full command is more complex than in the other examples : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / us@@ r / local / mb@@ root / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o / t@@ r / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all parts of the command must be written in a row , sending the data as standard input must be switched on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the voice output dem@@ on by &amp; K@@ DE ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently in use in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the voice is done only in K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use as voice services as voice services in &amp; mouth ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD card to setup in the setup dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to use &amp; mouth ; you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally as memory for the language generator ) which depends on your computer and its configuration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; mouth ; is an application that cannot speak text by the machine , which can &apos;t speak text by the machine . a list has already been saved , which the user can re@@ produce again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
note that &amp; mouth ; no voice syn@@ thesizer contains . on the computer a voice syn@@ thesizer must be installed .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you are not set up for the first startup , the Car@@ ei@@ Card spokesperson are displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the card information is displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most TTS syn@@ thesizer offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or such that is set up in volume or speed . you should also use several variants for a syn@@ thesizer before you want &amp; use , because the program speed sched@@ uling features the standard speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printer spo@@ ons for the same printer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you click on the Car@@ dig@@ ger speakers in t@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the card file name will appear . this will then automatically appear when you run kt@@ ops rock@@ ing and no or@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all types of speakers appear in this list . the preferred speaker appear in the list . the su@@ preme spokes@@ man is used for voice output when applying no speaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to further push the speakers in the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
click on one of these buttons to address your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; -@@ System .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choose a m@@ oods here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a Jun@@ gen@@ - and girls agree to choose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you click here , the new speaker will appear on the Car@@ ei@@ Card spokesperson . to change the settings of this microphone , click Edit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can already use it . go back to the card tab and check that the TTS service from &amp; K@@ DE will be used . now you can use the voice card to make text read and manage to manage text .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have at least one speaker , you can open the voice card system by &amp; K@@ DE ; click on the card @-@ card information to open this card file . here you can set some general options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this starts the K@@ DE TTS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , and you can set text orders and read the TTS system by &amp; K@@ DE ; de@@ activated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if t@@ t@@ sm@@ gr finished , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , if the field of voice is activated ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is crossed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this check box is marked and t@@ t@@ sm@@ gr appears automatically in the system area of the Control bar , it disappears again as soon as the reading is completed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the buttons in this series you can start text orders , stop , stop and record . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the buttons in this row , you can read the latest text in the &amp; K@@ DE ; or open a text file to read . you may also change the speaker for an order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click on Apply or OK , then all changed settings are taken on all pages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the card memory card is only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started , click on the card and tick the card on the card ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser from &amp; K@@ DE ; you can read the text of the displayed web page . please check the text that can be read before . after short time , the voice output should begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web site . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ st@@ ressing and other invisible brands are also read . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; Kate ; the enhanced text editor by &amp; K@@ DE ; you can read first text , first read , and select the text that can be read before . then select the text issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also works when &amp; Kate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ anta ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Noti@@ fy is the mess@@ aging system of &amp; K@@ DE , which you will be notified by you . you can read the text of this news from &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation ; in the IR@@ C program from &amp; K@@ DE , you can set up various kinds of messages . for example , you can create a message in which your nick@@ name is common . with &amp; kt@@ ts you can then read the IR@@ C message @-@ text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
supports a &amp; K@@ DE ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , appears a menu entry in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; filters for string cut@@ ters offer a good opportunity in &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is a good example . you removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages that the K@@ mail sent , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as this can be accepted as provided in most cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Fil@@ ters , text will be processed until he is sent to the Speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for the improvement of pron@@ unci@@ ation to replace false spoken words or short@@ cuts , or deal with certain defects of speech thes@@ ia and their voices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to understand the work of filters , it is important to know how the program is working with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four kinds of texts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of screen re@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority . it will be read all other orders and keeps these orders . if the issue of the screen reader is read , the selected jobs will continue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
war@@ nings is the next priority . this stage is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is used to get hot . a warning has priority and keeps the issue of messages and normal text . these orders will continue after the warning of the warning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; messages received the next priority . a message canc@@ els normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that enters the room . while you are looking for a long text on a website , you can welcome someone else . &amp; K@@ DE ; messages are also messages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest are simple text orders . each order , which you used from the boxes card orders is a text order . text orders are intended for the issue of longer term lyrics , which have no particular ur@@ gency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all four order types are working in queu@@ es , with the exception of the issue of screen re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such a reading , this issue will be stopped and finished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first you have to know that filters can never be applied to the issue of Screen Re@@ aders . you will be applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text orders as well as &amp; K@@ DE ; messages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; filter process the text , giving it further to the next filter . at present there are three kinds of filters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; filters are implemented as modules . in the future , there can still be further types of filters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sub@@ assemblies replace parts of a text by other text . the resulting parts can be delivered either as words or as regular expressions such as : - ) by text or as regular expressions like : - ) by text or for the transformation of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; K@@ mail ; in a better understand@@ able form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ Um@@ former use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) um &amp; XML ; included in a format in another format . are some X@@ SL@@ T files for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; included in SS@@ ML .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or subject to a speaker . if you have sent a female voice for example , you can read text from K@@ DE messages over it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each of these various filter has adjustable rules , according to which he does not apply to a speech output . if the filter indicates that his rules cannot be found at the next filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ notification on &amp; kt@@ ts is sent , it is processed by all activated filters , which are processed by the filter in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows the list of the furnished normal filter . isn &apos;t a filter off , it is not activated and is not used . filters are re@@ produced from the top to bottom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click here to add a new filter . select the type of the filter , and it will be shown below the following configuration dial@@ ogs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to set up a string of characters you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as compar@@ ative text , then the text will be replaced with the appropriate spare text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name , it just needs to be different from the name of the other filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column match and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column replacement . the list will be re@@ produced from top to bottom .
click here to move the marked word or regular expression in the list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file to save the current list or delete the list from a file to the existing list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a language written , the filter is only applied to display a list of languages here . click on the button to select a list of languages here , if you hold the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l click here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here a value is entered here , the filter is used only if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , K@@ mail &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can get the application ID application programs with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example , &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID Cop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 can only be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the drawing filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with one entry in the box this filter if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when compar@@ ing words , the string gri@@ pper filter regul@@ ars in the form \ \ s Word \ \ s. the words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ating characters ( spaces ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this manual you will not find instructions for writing of regular expressions . if you have the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; print@@ outs can be am@@ big@@ uous in the package .
XML @-@ trans@@ formers translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format in another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such forms . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . it can be only installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is available via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H is enough also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the speaker filter you can send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the Car@@ ei@@ Card spokesperson , or to a speaker containing specific properties . you can define , for example , that texts by K@@ mail can be read by a female voice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you put a text on the filter , it is looking for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected according to the speaker , and sends the text on the map speakers . with the speakers you can send the selected speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a value is entered here is a value of the filter if the text is contained in the given regular expression . on your system the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ editor &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; available on the button to get help with the input .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression in the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the text is specified by you , the speaker is selected , the speaker is selected to meet the desired requirements . click on the button to view the dialog box selection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
use these buttons to save or download all settings or delete all settings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only then apply to the text , if all conditions apply with one entry in the box this filter if you have to apply at least one condition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the language edition API , by &amp; K@@ DE ; to give a TTS capabilities to their applications . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module , with the voice syn@@ thesizer can be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that your syn@@ thesizer can use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface for both AP@@ Is you can find on the K@@ DE ; Acces@@ sibility website ( htt@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications for voice output services across the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface by &amp; K@@ DE ; from the kt@@ ts@@ d over the object K@@ Speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , text is the text for reading and option a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands , please enter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open two &amp; console ; window . launch a window in a window , then c@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of the mentioned language syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have set up &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ conversion filter , but when using the module for festival web pages are not read . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to an error in the 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone , so that S@@ able is not able to use this voice and make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H can be found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause mistakes in syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , so that whole sets are ski@@ pped or only Kau@@ der@@ b@@ sch will do . what can I do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , make sure the option is set to match the correct value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be fixed by a string of string . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; KT@@ TS works with any voice syn@@ thesizer , which can be started on the command line in one &amp; console ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list of the above languages may be incomplete or dated . so , you can also consult the description of syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the program &quot; Speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher , uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice syn@@ thesizer . if you want to expand &amp; expand by using another syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the support of SS@@ ML and is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can not install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to comp@@ ile &amp; comp@@ ile , you need a current development environment from K@@ DE ( Version 3.4 or newer ) including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the source files for the &quot; Speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have downloaded the source texts from &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can download , translate and install the tar@@ ball for each night or install the program with the following commands : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before you go &amp; use ; first use whether speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher works with your language syn@@ thesizer correctly . you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ u ; it is used to develop the program @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . the t@@ ms@@ bu@@ cher program should be so further developed and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer required .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a long text is broken into individual phr@@ ases . the user can go back , repeat the issue or cancel the output . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an application form text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; for example , you can request the attributes of the preferred speaker for the output . if you want to learn a speaker , the language is used , otherwise it will automatically choose the best matching speaker . if you want to learn more about it ; if you want to learn more about it , you can see one speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you click on the Car@@ ei@@ Card spokesperson or click on to add a spokesperson for the list , the boxes of the module Inter@@ active is shown below . details on modules can be found below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter the path for the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path is contained in P@@ AT@@ H , you only need to enter festival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the string code for text that will be handed over to Festival . by voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts , this setting is automatically applied . in general , Western languages are ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 apply , e@@ aster@@ ly languages such as Czech or Slovak , ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with these shooting developers set volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some sli@@ der and display these grey , the chosen voice will not be given to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n @-@ voices will be loaded several seconds due to their size . if you check this check box , these voices will already be syn@@ thes@@ ized when starting K@@ TT@@ SD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this tick is not selected , you have not yet opened a speaker ( or to click on users ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this check box is marked for the start of t@@ t@@ sm@@ gr the program window in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this check box is marked and t@@ t@@ sm@@ gr it does not run yet , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text . thus , you have the opportunity to read or otherwise control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here are all orders given in the queu@@ e , together with the application which has set the order , the number of phr@@ ases and the straight processed set . the speaker ID is equivalent to the ID card . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the buttons in this series you can link sat@@ ise in your order , which is selected in the list below , or not every order is composed of several sets ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a click on OK , all changes of settings ( also on the other card cards ) and t@@ t@@ sm@@ gr will be smaller to the icon in the system section . click on this icon to show the program window again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here only text orders are listed and managed . spending of screen re@@ wards , war@@ nings and messages are not displayed . further information on the message types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the type of audio output . if a component can not be selected , it has been compiled or fixed without support for the corresponding audio module , or not load the necessary libraries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for the audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you have to select at least one module . see also the PC@@ M device . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
adjust the speech speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % corresponds roughly half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % of the double normal speaking speed . that these settings can be implemented and the program Inst@@ x must be installed .
click on users to take care of the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; -@@ System .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . you will need to figure out what device works with you . in doubt , select Standard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this card , you can set up special actions which will always be carried out if the text order is interrupted from a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language orders : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of screen re@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority . it will be read all other orders and keeps these orders . after the issue of the screen reader is read , the retained orders will be res@@ umed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
war@@ nings may be the next priority . this stage is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is subject to hot text . a warning will keep the issue of messages and normal text . these orders will continue after reading the warning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; messages have the next priority . a message canc@@ els normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks with &amp; mouth ; yet somebody welcome someone who enters the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a text message is interrupted by a message , warning or issue of a screen reader , add &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output in the queu@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this audio file will always be played if a normal text message is interrupted when the guiding sound is active as well as an introduc@@ tory message , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings on this card only apply to normal text orders . for messages , war@@ nings and spending of screen re@@ a@@ ders there are no special promotions if these messages be interrupted by a higher priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to start reading with &amp; drop messages , start ct@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click al@@ erts . the card messages will appear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check this check box to shift the reading of &amp; K@@ DE ; however , this setting is not checked , the remaining settings are de@@ activated and &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads no al@@ erts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications are recorded in which a sound is played , of &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . if you click on the button , a dialog will appear in which you want to add the application and the event you want to add . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this event reads the news , conversation &amp; conversation ; if anyone mentioned your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all events that are specified in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
use this drop down box to determine what &amp; kt@@ ts should do when an event occurs . you have the following selection options :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have selected custom text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholder : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can enter here the features of the desired microphone . standard cho@@ oses the speaker , which is shown in the list on the map speaker as top entry . see also . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note that there are three levels of events . otherwise , this action is performed for any particular application . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of particular application . as the last option the action comes to fru@@ ition which was specified below standard ( all other events ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the event All noti@@ fications for application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list , as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use the button to store the settings for noti@@ fications in a file . if you want to use stored settings from a file , click on Del@@ ete . all entries except all notification will be deleted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard to mark text for a speech output . furthermore , trademarks for controlling the voice of voice . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W3@@ C standard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following limitations are available :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , since this is the default voice used in the SS@@ ML edition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the settings for speed or sound in the festival configuration dialog is not available on 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ ot@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &apos; 1.0 @-@ 8 &apos; ? &gt; &lt; ! doc@@ type U@@ PU@@ BL@@ IC / / / W3@@ C / / DT@@ D / TR / Speech @-@ Syn@@ thesis / syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ .@@ dt@@ d . who has slept in my bed ? asked mom Bear . who has slept in my bed ? asked the bear of the bear . &#93; &#93; &gt;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two kinds of filters - normal filters and stat@@ limits filter ( SD@@ B filter ) . thus , you can also start reading or stop the first set when the voice syn@@ thesizer does not directly support it directly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here you can see the setting limit@@ ing filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , it is automatically set up as an umbrella limit@@ ing filter . you can change its settings or add further incorpor@@ ation limits to beginners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the simpl@@ est you learn the setup of the speaker selecting , and select the speaker selecting : select some features and verify the selection of speakers . for this purpose you must have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter selection is in@@ effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; then faster start reading , since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can take very long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can request text orders then on the boxes card or cancel , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these reasons , the normal sentence limits will be automatically set up when you start the t@@ x@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be disabled , unless you know what you are doing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; randomly compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ posi@@ tional and inser@@ ting a tab@@ ular sign ( dec@@ im@@ al@@ code 8 ) to the stat@@ ute limits ( tab characters are automatically removed from the text by the filter ) . note , that the standard stat@@ ute filter keeps the drawing function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; K@@ DE ; messages ( for@@ ce@@ ) , war@@ nings , messages or the issue of screen re@@ a@@ vers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have removed from writing the normal setting limit@@ ing filter , you can paste this by using the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of speech , you can review the speaker settings for the application . the card card is displayed if &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
use of the standard feature ( the upper@@ most on the Car@@ ei@@ Card spokesperson card ) . in other words , no speaker properties are specified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use the best microphone to delete or edit all features of a microphone , choose &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise it elec@@ ts &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker , which is the most presented in the original features . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
select the method for entering the desired language properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the features of the desired microphone . if this property doesn &apos;t play a role there is nothing .
mark this check box if the property should have priority over other features . you can also place multiple markings here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the language is a critical factor when understanding the issue , it is always used as a priority property . you will probably know that a certain application text will be displayed in any other language than that in the working environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use all properties in the field speaker , which is most likely to er@@ ase , click on the selection button and then apply to speakers which are closest to the following . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this case 0 stands for the last text order in the queu@@ e . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number is the entry 0 required ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ oc@@ t@@ sm@@ gr cras@@ hes immediately , when it is started . I have compiled de@@ bug support , but I do not get trace@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the audio output over AL@@ SA does not work if I need to play music at the same time with another application , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ts ; a message appears at the &amp; console ; a message appears at open PC@@ M . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on your system , the problem that conflicts with AL@@ SA will prevent conflicts between several PC@@ M devices , which can be found on the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ Per@@ t@@ .org . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have downloaded an additional voice for festival on the Internet . I have installed it , and can &apos;t use it in festival but t@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not show that voice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / Tabs / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / Vo@@ ices . as guide , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL , in which you have found the voice to the developer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the audio card there is a setting speed . so that this works , the program So@@ x has to be installed and above the surrounding variable P@@ AT@@ H . some Syn@@ th@@ esi@@ as@@ mod@@ ul@@ s such as Festival Inter@@ active offers a setup for speed . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; settings for the speaking speed are ignored when read@@ out ; &amp; HTML ; read on your own tags , where the speed is controlled . ( see ) or if you are super bold , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML . ( see ) or if you are bold , change the speech speed up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not create that web pages are presented with a female voice , but I have a female Festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day S@@ able GEN@@ DE@@ X seems to work . in order to convert the X@@ SL file to converting SS@@ ML to SA@@ B@@ ER the GEN@@ DER tags . the same applies to VO@@ ICE tags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have added an own character chain and now I can go back in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no longer sat@@ el@@ ise forward or go back . on the cardboard boxes , the order consist only from a set . what am I doing wrong ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , call@@ signs , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) are not allowed to filter out . use a filter for setting up limit@@ ing instead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some users live in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts with the audio output . if your system has to read , you can &apos;t play music and then start a text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de still does not support real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current set will still be read . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the audio program So@@ x is used for general adjustment of speech speed , but otherwise it is not mandatory .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Festival is one of the best free TTS syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and it will be multiple voices and languages with &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need to install at least one language . help it to be delivered to the instructions , which can be delivered with the Festival . if you want to read websites , you need to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these voices , you need to comp@@ ile an additional module , so you need the source code from the festival . the German voices are subject to limitations when passing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; best , use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; that allows the management of the network interfaces , of routine and DNS settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a series of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K menu c@@ contro@@ l@@ centre ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create a simple surface for the user :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after installation , a new module settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center is displayed . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be launched by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network settings in &amp; k@@ menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot be installed and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device might show and configure the network properties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in most cases , drivers for the network hardware and other devices are installed and set up . network tools later added , the drivers need to be loaded by adjusting the following files , according to the kernel version . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the module settings will be loaded , if the module settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when starting module network settings this , the platform will automatically detect the platform on the system automatically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the platform cannot be detected , the hands can be selected from the list , which can be permanently hit the distribution and the Rel@@ e@@ as@@ est@@ and . by marking the settings the network settings will be automatically set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the change of network settings is only possible in system management mode . before , all the options are displayed in system management mode . in the system administration mode you can only be previ@@ ew@@ ed . in the system administration mode you can only be previ@@ ew@@ ed . in the system management mode the input of the module is required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the system management mode , the full functionality of the module is available . these are divided into three riders : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tab network interfaces can be used for managing the network devices of the system . all available network interfaces can be displayed .
the specified network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button interface ... in the dialog device can be set up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using the automatic selection , the TCP / IP settings are carried out using a DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP Server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP information will be required for any system startup . in the list box , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , will be selected according to the system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with choosing manual , without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , the TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field IP address the sub@@ net mask must be determined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it should be ensured that the IP address of an already existing IP address would not lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping to the &amp; console , you can determine whether the desired address is already in use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
network devices can be activated or switched off as required . switch @-@ off of a network unit is activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on demand , network devices can be activated or de@@ activated . disable the activated network equipment by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speci@@ fies the IP address of the computer in the local network , which medi@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the computer is more than one network interface , the interface must be selected via the network in which the gateway computer is selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer with DNS support replaces a full domain name due to the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer is requested in an IP address like 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the calcul@@ ator for nam@@ ing up part of the riders name resolution allows easy administration of this list . entries can be added , removes or modified .@@ DNS entries are set up in the list with the buttons up or down in the top priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by pressing the button , adding ... from the group machine to name resolution can be added to a DNS server . it will be added to the new nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button . the entry will be inserted in the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the group machine to name resolution , choose an entry and then click the button Edit .... It will show the dialog Edit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list known by name is host @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP system . it is used primarily for boats , if no DNS server is available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normally , the list contains well @-@ known calcul@@ ator some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv@@ 6 addresses will still support you in the future version 4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computer and click Add .... The dialog of New Ali@@ as will be shown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter the name of the well @-@ known computer and click the button . if the well @-@ known calcul@@ ator has multiple ali@@ as names , the button add several times and enter the other alias names . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
select an entry of a well known computer from the list and select Edit .... The dialog box editing will appear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be carried out one of the following tasks , then with clicking OK the list of static hosts will be updated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings used in the Module network settings are not immediately available in the system . in order to activate the changes , the following command must be removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the homepage from &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net that you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; K@@ DE ; and Q@@ t are installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download and install the rpm package , and install it in one &amp; console ; with rpm as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
alternatively a tool with a graphic interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution can be used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE ; not , but additionally , the development packages are needed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is recommended only by experienced users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should afford this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first section of this chapter , there are important information about basic network technology in the second , all by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; modified configuration files are discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this section can not replace further knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information is medi@@ ated over the integration of the PCs into a small ( home ) network .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv@@ 4 ) . IPv@@ 6 has never seen great distribution . therefore , IPv@@ 6 is expected to focus on the common IPv@@ 4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most important information is how to assign IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; workplace is the contact address given to a valid IP address or if available , the IP address cannot simply be chosen arbit@@ rar@@ ily ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when placing an own small ( home ) network the IP address should be selected from a specially reserved area to avoid IP address conflict with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded to the Internet . therefore their use is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for smaller networks , addresses are usually used in the area of 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the range is large enough for networks up to 250 machines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the net mask is mostly set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all computers will be in the same network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first one is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the net address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . usually , the address is assigned to 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 of an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this part contains the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this file is sometimes changed in DSL connections , so it doesn &apos;t surprise if in case of active DSL connections there is another content than established there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ S@@ Econ@@ cage . another stand as expected can occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&amp; cr@@ on ; is an application that allows you to run other programs after a timet@@ able in the background . it is a graphical interface for the system cr@@ on .
when starting from &amp; cr@@ cr@@ on ; you can see a list of presented tasks and associated environmental variables . if you use &amp; cr@@ cr@@ on ; if you are using &amp; cr@@ on ; it will appear both for all users of the system and the internal tasks . every folder can be re @-@ opened and folded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a de@@ activated task , program name and parameter will not appear and below description will be disabled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the variable environment variable , otherwise , set the existing environment variable for all the listed tasks except power . when a de@@ activated variable appears as a description . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create a new task first , choose the tasks folder . then you can then click on the right mouse button to select the tasks folder and click C@@ tr@@ l ; N press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter here the name of the program . you may choose either a relative or an absolute path name . if you want to search the program first , press select .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the minute ( s ) , to which the task is to be performed . with &amp; cr@@ cr@@ on , you can specify the minutes in fifth steps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you specify both Mon@@ at@@ Day ( e ) as well as week@@ day ( e ) , the program will be carried out either on the 1st and 15th of the selected months regardless of the week &apos;s day , no matter what date they fall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for creating new tasks , changes will only become active if the c@@ ron@@ tab has been stored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to cut out a task first , select the remote task first . then go to editing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , you can also click on the variable button to select the variable and enable you to display the variable name and value of the variables . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if all tasks and environment variables have been entered or altered , you still need to save the c@@ ron@@ tab . select the menu item Save . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , you can press C@@ tr@@ l ; S . changes or additions to tasks or variables are then actively active . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it appears the standard K@@ DE ; -@@ Print dialog . if you choose valves , see that there are two additional &amp; cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the printer dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; print the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users , the extended per@@ missions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cr@@ on . for example vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; cr@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command c@@ ron@@ tab to change the schedules of the user .
a PO@@ SIX @-@ compliant &amp; UNIX ; for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; cr@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands by &amp; UNIX ; to learn time and date .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first aim was to save several archives on a band . the first aim was to save several archives on a band . the first goal was to create a surface for tar which presented my wife : how much longer it takes , if you feel ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before a band can be used , it has to be mounted by &amp; co@@ dat ; this can be done in three ways : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; dat ; trains the band back and read the pre@@ ten@@ er information of the band . recognize &amp; k@@ dat , the tape on the tape , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape is supposed to be format@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the pro@@ claim , is searching for the matching index on your record . if it is not found , you will be asked if the band index will be re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive , to indicate that the tape has been incorporated . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the contents of the band can now be searched for the tape . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before throwing the belt , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to achieve this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; dat ; speci@@ alize in a change of symbol for the band , that the integration of the band was solved and displays a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be rejected without any danger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before a band of &amp; k@@ dat ; can be used , it has to be format@@ ted by &amp; co@@ dat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a band type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to save data . this process does not have to be format@@ ted before using the tape of &amp; k@@ dat ; if you do not have to form@@ ulate a tape before using the tape , DA@@ T drives on the other hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after entering the band name and the capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; with the formation of the tape . all data on the tape is lost ! after completion of the form@@ atting process , the tape is automatically integrated and ready to use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you start the backup process , you need to select the secured files . that can be done in three ways : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file , or folder is secured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
select a f@@ use profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
mark files in the local file tree with a tick . only the so selected files and / or sub@@ folders are secured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the right mouse button on the local file tree , and select the menu in the menu ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the backup has been introduced , the dialog box will open up for backup . in this dialog you can even check the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog will show the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only test the selected file or folders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick , only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
please click on the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry ....
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the test procedure started , the dialog settings dialog for checking . in this dialog you can review your selection and check the work folder for checking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have confirmed the settings for checking , the dialog will show the progress of the audit process as well as data throughput and the remaining time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you can be able to restore the restore , the files need to be recovered , and this can be done in two ways : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choose a file or folder in one of the archives , which belong to the tape set . it will only be restored the selected file or the sub@@ folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the desired files from one of the archives , with a tick . it will only be restored as selected files and / or sub@@ folders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the right mouse button , click on a file or a folder in one of the archives and select in the menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the recovery process has been started , the dialog settings for restoration . in this dialogue you can review your selection and change the work folder for restoration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have confirmed the settings for restoration , the dialog will show the progress of the recovery process as well as data throughput and the remaining time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , it is necessary to re @-@ create the tape inde@@ x@@ file using the band content . this process del@@ etes all existing In@@ dex@@ files for this band . you can re@@ write the index to two kinds of tape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a safety profile with the currently selected files and the default settings are created . you can make the following settings for a f@@ use profile :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current work@@ book , where the backup is to be done . the list of the secured files will automatically be updated accordingly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all folders that are listed under the backup files , that only those files are stored on the same file system can be found separately under the file system . each entry is considered separately from the others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , it will only have the files that have changed since then . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the name of the file , which is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
delete the snap@@ shot file before the call of tar . this causes all files to be secured and a new snap@@ shot file is created for the next backup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; ts ; and lt ; it was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can set up settings via the K@@ D@@ at menu ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can be made :
the complete path to device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / Tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ design variant of the tape device .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is this setting active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is bound to load the drive . with some drives this is necessary before reading or writing imple@@ ments can be done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this option is enabled , the option is tried to lock and put the cast out of the tape drive . perhaps this setting doesn &apos;t work with all band@@ ages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if enabled , the option is switched on , automatically cast out the tape . use this option to flo@@ ppy streaming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the option is enabled , tried &amp; G@@ dat ; not all drives support variable block@@ ages . no matter if this attitude is active or not , you need &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block@@ size will be assigned to your tape drive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the band . this file should only take one memory block onto the tape . the contents of the file consists as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( n byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is host : seconds , which hosts the full name of the system in which the tape has been format@@ ted for seconds that has been format@@ ted since the era .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .@@ k@@ dat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the files on the tape are pure tar -@@ Archives , which can manage directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar do not work as long as they do not deal with incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the content of a backup association . this symbol is only active when a band is bound . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ viewer for system logs , which allows you to run information about your system or where the system allows the different protocol files . beyond that , provides quick access to information about problems that occur on your server . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; provides users to understand users , what makes your computer in the background . the task is suitable for unwanted users , which cannot know where you can &apos;t know the different protocol files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log enables easy access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log will therefore try to be filtered and analysed some extended functions with their help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; a number of useful functions . among other things include :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many other functions are also included in addition and are explained in other chapters of this manual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you can see in the following screenshot , &amp; quot ; functions are available , using the individual protocol lines of a protocol @-@ file easily and sort them out in the next chapter of this manual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the start was tried &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log - first the main protocol version of the system - the system protocol will not be displayed , so you don &apos;t have the protocol files in the folder / var / log , for the normal user usually don &apos;t have permission to read . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also use the filter bar , in order to filter by a selected crit@@ eri@@ on or according to the filter bar . in default , a string line will be displayed when in one of the columns contain the string selection string . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also select another entry in this place . for example , select the string from the filter string and enter the name line in the filter bar ; all the protocol lines , which were sent or created by this process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this option is enabled in default settings , and helps you to identify the important protocol lines . protocol @-@ lines of the level error are displayed with an ob@@ sc@@ ary color as the protocol lines . the colored display of protocol lines can be shut off setup dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would you like to display only certain process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in the cr@@ on protocol ) , so you can see the process identification ( PID ) in the column process . in this case you can use filter bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , you can activate the option on new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new version lines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log : allows displaying multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ folders . to open this feature , use the entries in the menu to open additional sub@@ window and select a log @-@ window in the menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; has a dedicated website to htt@@ p : / / ks@@ ystem@@ log@@ .@@ or@@ g. a site you will find further information about the sources de &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ;
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; in addition you can also find in the following folder of the &amp; C@@ DE ; -@@ Subversion Archi@@ vs : ks@@ ystem@@ log ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Archive
welcome to &amp; K@@ DE ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section sets a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the system V In@@ it is quickly developed for the control of the program start @-@ up by the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . and that &apos;s why it is easier to use , more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will not go further to historical aspects here ( because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ it binary file is below / s@@ bin and not below / etc . this is therefore important , because perhaps someone could try to rev@@ ise a machine on System V In@@ it , without a new installation and new format . therefore , you need to make sure the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SY@@ S@@ V In@@ it differenti@@ ates from the BSD In@@ it , that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are instead directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folder : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for every system service that you need to start at the beginning of the system or during the change to another run@@ level . system services include such things like set@@ serial . such calls are not only started to r@@ c.@@ local .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; r@@ c.@@ local should lie on the one hand beneath / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it , even if you do not want much use for it . you can also use a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run something when you start riding a little . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kernel searches at different places after the program in@@ it , and starts the first to find it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point you can throw a look into the second column and probably determine that the default run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can repair it by restart the system restart and execute the following : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but how does it start now all the right scripts ? if you command ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d then you probably see something like the following :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will notice that in this folder there are no real files . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how does it start and stops in@@ it actually system services ? quite simply : each of the scripts is so written that it is an argument like start and stop . you can actually run this script by hand on the command line : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would read the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and when the K includes a script , the script is called up with the argument . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people want to set up a simple way for many purposes . I could run &amp; run ; a server running level , that is just htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc . , I could also run a user ; &amp; K@@ DM ; , Network &amp; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was used as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another index is easy to say . simply drag an entry in the field of available system services to one of the six rounds level to start it on this level ( or stop it ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also move scripts between Run@@ lev@@ les or move the position within a level , while the entry is removed from its original run@@ level ( or its position ) . this only does not happen if they take an entry from the field of available system services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : entries are moved , if you select it into a new run@@ level . to select them from the menu Edit or from the context menu or even if the same entry has already existed in the target range of action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sorting number one entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must process the sorting of the bo@@ unding entries before you again try to insert the system service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : currently there is no way to restore entries , which were thrown into the Recy@@ cle Bin . so be careful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can use the tab key to activate the different work areas ( avail@@ ables 1 Start , run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc . ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection top or below .
to move an entry into another round level , move it into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to manually change the sequence number or the name of an entry manually , press the dialog button to change the changes , or press Es@@ c to dis@@ card the changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before they are executed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . def@@ aults to the global file ( $ K@@ D@@ ED@@ IR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ r@@ c ) . otherwise they will be saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; otherwise they will be saved in a local k@@ sy@@ r@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ lev@@ eln , and now the machine starts fast . what can I do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter the L@@ ILO Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in individual user mode , then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be okay ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under run@@ level X but they are not executed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ( D@@ LD ) , then you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read details in the manual of distribution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the species , such as system services in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies the configuration for proprietary import programs in these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately not a standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v are planning an extension of the program for that approach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are using a different distribution , please check if all configuration files are available ( as &amp; eg ; Apache / htt@@ p@@ d ) just do without a message if their configuration files are not available or fal@@ sely furnished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can be even different from version to Version . if you are using a different distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this manual can be added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program , you can manage the users and groups of your system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it &apos;s sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you have made changes , you need to save it . either use the corresponding icon of tool@@ bars or the entry Save in the menu file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ user ; is an easy application . the main window consists of two flas@@ h@@ cards , the user and user group list . to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog box or group characteristics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some card cards are displayed only if you have enabled system settings , if you are installed on individual settings , if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the card password management appears if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD -@@ Uni@@ xes .
this card will only appear if for at least one single file system constra@@ ints ( Qu@@ ota ) is initi@@ alized and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ zable by the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the fil@@ esystem ) . here you can change parameters for each user . the limitations of each user can be changed in KB :
these parameters can be individually adjusted for each file system . the current system fil@@ esystem is selected with the help of the fil@@ esystem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the card contains groups informed about the user &apos;s group associated with the user . furthermore , the user belongs to the primary group . furthermore , the user can select a member in other groups by marking them in the big field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the dialog box features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to add a user or a group , select from the menu user or group or click on the matching button button . edit or delete the selected user and the selected group works as anal@@ og@@ ical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this module , you can add , remove and modify the boot password , remove the boot password , remove the standard operating system , remove , alter operating systems , remove , change , and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
