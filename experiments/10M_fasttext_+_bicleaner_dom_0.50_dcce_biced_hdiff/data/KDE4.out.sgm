<seg id="2956">Welcome to & KDE; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; this section sets a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">"" "" "" "the system V Init is quickly developed for the control of the program start-up by the system in the & Linux; world. and that's why it is easier to use, more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD init." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further to historical aspects here (because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"" "" "" "the init binary file is below / sbin and not below / etc. this is therefore important, because perhaps someone could try to revise a machine on System V Init, without a new installation and new format. therefore, you need to make sure the old init was removed from there if there was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2960">"" "" "" "the SYSV Init differentiates from the BSD Init, that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are instead directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following additional folder:" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for every system service that you need to start at the beginning of the system or during the change to another runlevel. system services include such things like setserial. such calls are not only started to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">"" "" "" "rc.local should lie on the one hand beneath / etc / rc.d if you need it, even if you do not want much use for it. you can also use a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run something when you start riding a little." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2963">"" "" "" "the kernel searches at different places after the program init, and starts the first to find it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"" "" "" "at this point you can throw a look into the second column and probably determine that the default runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can repair it by restart the system restart and execute the following:" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start now all the right scripts? if you command ls -l in rc3.d then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">"" "" "" "you will notice that in this folder there are no real files. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2968">"" "" "" "how does it start and stops init actually system services? quite simply: each of the scripts is so written that it is an argument like start and stop. you can actually run this script by hand on the command line:" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2969">"" "" "" "this would read the httpd server. init reads the name, and when the K includes a script, the script is called up with the argument." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2970">"" "" "" "some people want to set up a simple way for many purposes. I could run & run; a server running level, that is just httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc., I could also run a user; & KDM;, Network & etc." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was used as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another index is easy to say. simply drag an entry in the field of available system services to one of the six rounds level to start it on this level (or stop it).</seg>
<seg id="2973">"" "" "" "you can also move scripts between Runlevles or move the position within a level, while the entry is removed from its original runlevel (or its position). this only does not happen if they take an entry from the field of available system services." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "" "" "note: entries are moved, if you select it into a new runlevel. to select them from the menu Edit or from the context menu or even if the same entry has already existed in the target range of action." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">"" "" "" "the sorting number one entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must process the sorting of the bounding entries before you again try to insert the system service." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2976">"" "" "" "note: currently there is no way to restore entries, which were thrown into the Recycle Bin. so be careful." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to activate the different work areas (availables 1 Start, runlevel 1 Stop & etc.) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection top or below.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another round level, move it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
