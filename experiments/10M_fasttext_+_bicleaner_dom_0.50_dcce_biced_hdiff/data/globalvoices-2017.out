&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , American writers and sports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist because of an American film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter that led the mur@@ der@@ ous con@@ spi@@ racy of an oil painting with judges who had inc@@ lined his interest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was captured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; free after Method Man , &quot; I was it , as if it is the absolute truth , everything else is that I would like to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admi@@ ration for the USA was only enhanced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always said : &quot; America is the only country where I ever lived , whose variety is so inviting you can always be and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like minded people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I even wrote a very warm love letter about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
a lot has been written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most outstanding aspect of his ascension is for me as it goes with his initial face .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he never stops behind the mountain , as it is so beautiful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague , and publicly declar@@ es his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ American and Women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless the people responded to his statements and tuned in dro@@ ves for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 13 million votes he won in Republi@@ can Pre@@ elections , was the highest number ever reached by the nomin@@ ee candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was speech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person ? I asked myself ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was able to put tr@@ ump and his voters in accordance with the people , whom I met in Phoenix during my time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , wants to enter@@ tain people from around the world , with whom I could talk about Islam and its past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ quir@@ er , &quot; the current publisher of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ quir@@ er , &quot; did not agree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ ha@@ tia and I met us at our common love for basketball and we spent a lot of hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix One &quot; at stake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ umps In@@ toler@@ ance also stands in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced during Sandy B@@ ahr , who fought for their lives and husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like their son . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it still fits to the engagement of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who has always helped me to get used to the complexity of the American life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then we were still Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors who helped me a lot with my career .
those people and those through their em@@ bodied values deep@@ ened my love for America .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while tr@@ ump his way to the nominated Republi@@ can Presi@@ dential candidate , they offered me a stop and the equivalent of his Limited Vision of America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 8 November 2016 there were over 50 million Americans , mostly whit@@ eness , the presidency of a man despite - or perhaps because of his contemp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conflict with the idea that humans voted for Tr@@ ump , because they were either condemned to racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were ready to over@@ see these things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps it is un@@ fair to describe the Tr@@ ump voters as a breed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to order people , one of my friends , is exactly what has led us to this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is superf@@ icial and respect@@ ful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way , and think . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it shows people that their concerns and fears are not considered over the hec@@ tic changes in their communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could it be that these voters , most of which are white for Tr@@ ump , because they want to reg@@ ain control over a country that has disappointed them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in other words , they might say that they are still important in this America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who comm@@ ent@@ ate the cruel decision to raise a man who looks with contemp@@ t on those who look different than he . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( An@@ m. of WC . : as much as &quot; suppression of white against all other Eth@@ n@@ ics &quot; ; as much as Sch@@ leu@@ der@@ trau@@ ma ) , as it was the big Van Jones , exactly what America had made so great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have always may , America welcomes everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ ite , whose history as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Donald Tr@@ ump gives a huge part of the white America this promise , and says : to Hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole term of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is again on the helm , they say . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq and what he said in the eve of the election . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hillary Clinton at a rally of Hillary Clinton had a word @-@ change with the crowd .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , had a place in your America ? &quot; he asked Mr. Khan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crowd rep@@ lied with a loud &quot; no ! &quot;
&quot; do Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; filled the quantity .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your Americas ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered them .
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they called them and their voices were lou@@ der .
&quot; would someone not like you have a place in your America ? &quot;
he received an unanim@@ ously and silent &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan ended with the words : &quot; God is thanks , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is not your America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the land , for which his son was fallen , sent him a message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this now is Tr@@ ump Country and said the message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find any place in this new America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that breaks my heart .

what has the mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca in common ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the music , which is played in both places , has not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the outskirts of a large land@@ fill land@@ fill only 16 Kilom@@ eters south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; a ancient colonial town which is very popular among tourists and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a few years now La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Music ban@@ de ) in the municipality has now been playing existing symph@@ ony orchestra , which with their musical instruments has the possibility of over@@ coming poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a school @-@ school with 100 students has become central interest to the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the municipality , located in one of the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of Mexico , is known for their drug abuse and gangs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who launched a musical project and the youth thus offered a rare hope . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the young band members take their comm@@ it@@ ments to the musical group very seriously in the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI means :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once they come out of school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are always laughing and playing with shiny eyes and play in the action day for trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
music from garbage
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are playing the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village situated on the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ on in the capital - on instruments produced from recycled waste material : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; music with re@@ produced instruments , which are made from local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycling led by Fa@@ vio Chávez with making parts of the fall into instruments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ ins , c@@ elli , contra@@ bass , saxophone , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums all produced from the tr@@ ash . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music by Beat@@ les , from Frank Sin@@ atra etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an article in the Los Angeles Times Fa@@ vio Chávez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , rec@@ alls the beginning : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first it was very difficult because we had no place to teach when we had no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live with their children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this changed as a Fa@@ vio something , which he had never seen before : one out of waste produced violin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , there is a whole orchestra which plays on instruments made of recovered material and is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a documentation N@@ ames &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) draws on musical performance :
the world generates approximately one billion tonnes of waste every year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who live with him and of him are the nu@@ ances - like men in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspiring talent in tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can combat the illegal fishing industry
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that tac@@ kled wild illegal fishing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this post , written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports targeted on international , practiced solutions for environmental problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the re@@ published occurs as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the common use of content .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already run illegal fishing in li@@ beri@@ ical waters before it visited the other coast of Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the East African countries were thus raised and inc@@ lined above them to welcome a criminal law of this kind in its co@@ asts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Kom@@ oren , Mozambique and the Seychelles mobil@@ ised fast@@ ly against the ship . they refused to feed one of their har@@ bours and refused to give him a fishing character . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you just refused , &quot; the Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading employee of the Ken@@ yan fish@@ eries authority , was part of a team that discovered the ship again and followed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region , and it wasn &apos;t able to catch fish there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia , because of the pil@@ lage of the country &apos;s fish stocks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the core of this initiative , which protects the criminal practices and protects resources , was founded by F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO stop illegal ( Il@@ legal Fish@@ eries stop ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aside from Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network were six countries that had sold the Premier from their waters at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and stand up with each other when it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , leader of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts project En@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is captured is hidden because it is extremely difficult to track down because it is illegal fishing a leading cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the obvious dis@@ agreements of existing laws , which should be protected by which certain habitats and types can harm the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems which have a delicate equilibrium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but while actions against illegal fishing were once hin@@ dered by bureaucra@@ tic hur@@ dles , and even through the sna@@ il @-@ emp@@ ties , these actions happen today in real @-@ time , with tracking at F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communications platform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the individual countries can exchange lic@@ ences for example to susp@@ icious activity or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port insp@@ ections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive , if they move on the open sea using satellite data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this enables the authorities to identify ships that are in prohibited areas , such as susp@@ icious driving routes - such as susp@@ ects that a ship invites his caught fish to other ships on the way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideally , such investigations can show whether the parties involved a fishing license where they were on the way and possibly also whether they have a criminal det@@ ox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; countries that are against illegal fishing can be denied by the acceptance of such ships in their har@@ bours , which means that the ships may not be able to sell their cargo to the figures as in the case of Premier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about substantial financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worth it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , head director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the already mentioned platform was created to gain lost turnover of 20 million USD , resulting from eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year due to the illegal f@@ ishers that penet@@ rate into East African waters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing trips that attracts the region &apos;s commercial fishing from all over the world . these also include those illegal f@@ ishers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among them practices such as sailing under false flag , counter@@ feit license papers , speci@@ fying fan@@ ta@@ si@@ names , fish protected species and fish in nature areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you use the missing international cooperation and make the weak@@ nesses of a non @-@ seamless control system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I could not start a ship illegal and a country could then say &apos; You &apos;re not allowed to run my port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; and this leg@@ ale can@@ y@@ hole attempts to close F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far the closed front works .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 trials of susp@@ icious ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has exposed criminal networks , which had f@@ ake licenses in Tanzania . there are ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has found whis@@ per@@ ing ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to his cooperation with Inter@@ pol , the international authority on crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing over great distances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i , susp@@ ects ships accurately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evol@@ ving , helps to protect illegal ships all like . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief Analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at Tracking , a N@@ RO , which also offers technical assistance with fish@@ eries data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the ships switch off their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be ort@@ et by satellites . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cop@@ eland helps to build a system , which connects various information levels . the ISH will help F@@ ISH visitors to help discri@@ min@@ ate ships with greater precision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations have influence on the undoubtedly global issue of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos and President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened together with Google and the Oce@@ anic organization Oce@@ ana , a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by means of every single tracking ship worldwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get a better picture of this to get a better picture of what happens , &quot; he says . &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite , and to bund@@ le their resources for an investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts has a similar project to run , in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only crimin@@ ating , but also qu@@ en@@ ching them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ships that have f@@ ished earlier without license and had barely expected with consequences , know that they are monitored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ki@@ ila @-@ i , some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH are now a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries sales , since fis@@ her boats buy more lic@@ ences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the insp@@ ectors found there on board the tow@@ ing nets , whose use is prohibited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice this success . &quot; the effect is so strong that we now copy other countries , &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; we also disappear several hundred million dollars annually through illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are six countries together to join the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force , as well as the illegal fishing industry , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; With certainty , even more such initiatives and structures will also be created in other regions . &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member of Somalia could report its first major triumph : in October there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship which was under false flag , and were not only used without a license and were now forbidden . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also banned in forbidden waters which are reserved for Fischer from Somalia . &quot; with the take @-@ out of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they can proceed with illegal fishing . &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special , collabor@@ ative way to protect the oceans is actually working throughout the world .

the street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of heavy demonstrations .
they are regarded as protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on the President of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the government of Venezuela had rejected the opposition of opposition to a referendum on a referendum on the political and economic crisis of the country , the Veneti@@ ans continued to find negotiations on the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the has@@ h@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the cap@@ turing of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate is also led in other parts of the country - amongst others in the low@@ land region Bar@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira in the central north @-@ north Bun@@ de@@ pot Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on the Isla Margar@@ ita in the State of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the political and economic situation in the country deterior@@ ates continuously , which makes it noticeable in the everyday life of the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans by a acute lack of food and drug . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many representatives of the Opposition saw in the removal of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro the chance of a fundamental change ; however , the holding of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises in their newest articles the context of government decisions as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and awareness of the highest in the whole world , the referendum held for many as the only way to cap@@ itali@@ ze its institutional structures and to close a new government flush . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the election campaign Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Diam@@ r@@ á@@ tica was put together into the way for the election of the National Assembly , which followed the opposition from the opposition to the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro in which the opposition to the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the proceedings against President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the proceedings against President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call has been commented on Twitter among other things as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as far as Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday , and on November 3 , all to Caracas to Mira@@ flo@@ res Palace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the first demonstration in the programme of action &quot; The re@@ mun@@ ition of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , October 26th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pictures of the fairy @-@ tale , which are published in real time , testify to people in numerous areas of the country , but also struggles with polic@@ emen as well as advoc@@ ates of the government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most commonly used images shows a prot@@ esters that calls through the protective plates : &quot; will you kill me , because I have hunger ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; particularly large waves beat the message of bur@@ sting suppression in the centrally located north @-@ north town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local Cathedral , in order to protect themselves according to their own statement before the police and the armed authorities of the government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests continued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police forces , including these women in the An@@ den@@ state T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira don &apos;t wear skirts ever , because otherwise you could not see what many nation@@ alities do not have ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile a Info@@ graphic makes the turn that forms the degree of op@@ pression per day :
thus the dictatorship was supp@@ ressed the land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many representatives of the government had asked the validity of the demand for a counter@@ part procedure - this was now proven by the presence of countless people on the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other values were taken as a further step in the fight against a government that made little over the devastating economic crisis , making it better to resist critical votes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they took us so much - but also fear !
the marty@@ rs always take more of frequency and intensity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans reported the media , they were too hungry to participate in a strike , instead of working or buying shop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an adap@@ ted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was premier@@ ed on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ inian news page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the interview was translated into English and is published with friendly permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentine city of Córdoba . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an adult , he said Qui@@ j@@ ano at the course of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera , in the province of Córdoba to his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the process , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were examined during the Argentine military dictatorship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; starting at the burden , same name as his father brought up to the brutal military operations in prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he has suffered enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he kept the secret sec@@ rec@@ y for 34 years .
in the situation I believed that was ok .
I felt like a secret .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child with 15 years , you don &apos;t notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , I couldn &apos;t realise that my father was a th@@ ief , Fol@@ terer and mur@@ der@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ eri@@ an officials . during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 he was the Deputy Commander of the Secret Service Division 141 in prison La Per@@ la .

recording of the archive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppressed , who is charged with ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in nearly 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who witnessed the mag@@ nit@@ ude of atro@@ cities , which he had witnessed as a boy , and he declared a German Supreme Court against his own father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his story shows that great power has a parent over his child , and how this child chose a way of redemption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I had friends with a young guy , fighting for martial arts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told my father of him and a few days later , he showed me a black and white photo and called me to identify my friend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said :
you are a dick@@ head . you have friends with one of the ERP friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it only indicates that they don &apos;t waste you one day , and then I must rescue you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ac@@ ron@@ ym ERP stands for Ej@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolution@@ ary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolution@@ ary Workers Party of Argentina .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , he banned me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he told me I would be a secret .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine , because my father had raised me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the military base I had to destroy Pap@@ ers who had heard the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simple everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

then the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos; .
my father took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first and last time he made me wait at the entrance in the car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he took me the second time he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he gave me a little in a blanket of wick@@ edly , and told me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that it was a big Kl@@ ump@@ en silver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on that day , I went to the other end of the Bar@@ ac@@ ke where the stolen objects turned off and kept me with a guard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in and saw a Lie@@ ge , tor@@ tured on man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she looked like a March @-@ bed and a metal fe@@ ather .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later I found out that an end of a cable was attached to it . the other end was fortified at the body of the person , which was tied there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they rarely captiv@@ ate a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , poured him with water and pursued him a charge of 220 volts to the gen@@ itals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the sten@@ ch there was terrible ... like a dirty wind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; years later when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body in need is in need . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I never forgot that smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked , How is it only possible that a man can do so much harm to another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ I knew that these people were killed &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - to the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and turned aside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z , a civilian who also was accused of trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses where naked people were bound with the face down - all were tied in hands and feet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
near the entrance to the people silent on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when my father observed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; Why do you look like as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why didn &apos;t you get me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried .
I know this because my father told home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides La Cu@@ ad@@ ra there were some rooms , designated as offices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero went down there a man and killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( according to survi@@ vors from survi@@ vors , Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused of the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , was also indicted by students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , head of the memorial La Per@@ la , leads through former torture chambers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the path that you came here came in , is also the way you came here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when looking at the card , check that they took about this route and then tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here their names were changed , and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dis@@ covering . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ck@@ ra till the arrangement of the above came that they should be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the lie - Euph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the van@@ ishing of their bodies , in most cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &apos; Battle of War &apos;
my dad brought all sorts of things with your home .
back then at age I had no idea what the &quot; war graves &quot; - as they called it - was .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when I was at the military , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear to me that war gra@@ bs a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military marks , which one is fought against a enemy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano with his son .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when one goes into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ tables , clothing , paintings , money ... sti@@ fying , then this is not war but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is theft .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always asked what my father , the leader of security forces , was able to join this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an officer at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house , and to steal everything in it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a crime , and I answered : and you , who were your cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not crimin@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explo@@ ded anger , beat me , and cried , saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and move around you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we don &apos;t need anyone else !
thus my father was .
I have no only good memory of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I said in the process , I showed a photo of back then I wore a jacket and a run@@ way pul@@ lover from wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothing to home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , the defence accused me of being a co @-@ carrying case of this crime . I resist , no problem , they can lay me on the burden of what they wanted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was there anyway to predi@@ ct .
&apos;@@ the dis@@ appearance of the body is the last ab@@ h@@ ous act &apos;
now where I am older I am sensitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have children . if you first have children , you recognize the value of a life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one develops , and recognis@@ es that it is wrong to kill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I even went so far to say :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so good , so during the dictatorship of man , did you ex@@ ult over the dead ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why children are kid@@ nap ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one day my father brought a girl with her home , his mother had been killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always asked the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they could have simply put them into prison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I reck@@ on , it was simply decided to kill these people . but why not release their cor@@ p@@ ses ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did these people not even have families that were handed over to their mort@@ al rem@@ n@@ ants ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ appearance of the body is the last abom@@ in@@ able act , which one can do to man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my father told me when the democracy was again introduced , they played machines to eliminate the mort@@ al rem@@ n@@ ants of the prisoners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have been crushed and removed somewhere - no idea where . &quot; you will never find something , &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but something always remains .
&apos;@@ I have seen how to kill people ! &apos;
just to clari@@ fy it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thought , to view my father , was created during a conversation when he was under house arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did him accus@@ ation because of all the atro@@ cities that I had to see .
then he suddenly told : &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have not killed anybody . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt disgu@@ ised by myself and in@@ quired of me why all patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they allegedly defended , were really good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I shou@@ ted :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how to kill people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have committed terrible crimes , and you forced me to participate in a child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he just resist@@ ed &quot; Na &quot; then bent me . &quot;
exactly what I did .
in 2010 I re@@ paid the first ad .
I finally knew that he was a criminal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can anticip@@ ate me that I am vo@@ ke , I finally told my own father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest standing before the end of the trial .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was indicted for 4@@ 16 crimes : including severe , illegal de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 98 severe cases , torture followed in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of one under 10 years of age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the Spanish &apos;s mag@@ nit@@ ude of the verdict .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera was committed to crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August , 1975 and December 1978 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 43 Sub@@ si@@ ers were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases the court was sentenced to life imprisonment in 28 cases , and in six cases there were hands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
eleven of the original 54 def@@ endants died during the trial .
# La@@ wn judgement : murder , torture and rape by ministers . # Es@@ war@@ heads
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the def@@ endants were members of the military during the dictatorship , former military personnel , former police officers and civilian staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he raised the following words to the chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory conceived by un@@ human heads .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the verdict is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations , who have worked for years on righteousness for the victims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , born in 1995 by the Argent@@ inian organisation H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who killed the children of people who were murdered during the dictatorship , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the process took over three years , but the research took 39 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ in@@ ean government handed over the country to La Per@@ la , so that there was a memorial to be established by human rights organisations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

a translation mistake makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; terrible drivers &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sign with the transmission errors at a center in Kyoto , where you can extend his driving licence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the photo was distributed in social media .
adaptation of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Japanese city Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long his driving licence , in the last month witnesses of a very special translation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a sign the jap@@ an@@ ese word was for@@ ce@@ able ( ko@@ rei@@ l sha ) , the &quot; older drivers &quot; means , but perhaps also with leaf@@ lets and # 8@@ 212 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from 1 @-@ 20 September on electronic adverti@@ se@@ ments in the entrance area and in the building itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was often shared in social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the error was grieved with Julian Holmes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the daily newspaper Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how did it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto just un@@ acceptable , &quot; said Holmes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the faulty English translation was initially removed . the name @-@ drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; aw@@ ful driving &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate , if they are not quite correct as &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Kyoto exc@@ uses for trans@@ lators . furthermore , she explained that the error was already mentioned in the text and that the translation was not checked on their correc@@ t@@ ness before it was published . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows the ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sorry that older people felt s@@ worn by the in@@ adequate correction ( the translation ) of our part , &quot; said the Police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast news set some more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; elderly drivers in Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; was den@@ oun@@ cing as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers have been involved in accidents , but quite cause to worry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture as for example , 1.@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 460 deaths were caused by sen@@ iors . this represents a share of 10 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ten years later , in 2014 , Sen@@ iors 1,@@ 80@@ 3 caused a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the number of accidents fell overall , the proportion of sen@@ iors caused accidents in the same period increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the named repor@@ ter brought comments on the light in the published version of the article comments to light , showing what pre@@ judi@@ ces against older drivers will he@@ ap up against older drivers : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the article on Yahoo over the translation error received the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; terrible driving &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , the translation is not at all , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that it &apos;s a true translation error . &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true discovery for this bizarre mistake in English .
photo by Flickr user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of trans@@ lators are mani@@ fold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to transfer , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the original text and active language skills to transfer him to the target language . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter requires the active rule of the target language - something that is in case of native language . generally , the belief that trans@@ lators should be in the target language - not in the initial language . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus a French native language was supposed to translate for example from English into French - not from French to English .
photo by Flickr user Karl Baron .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many Japanese companies don &apos;t employ workers with English as a native language , language into English . this may result in lack of understanding for the translation , expense or relatively low number of English native speakers who may learn Japanese . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some companies that even have no foreign staff , do translations , nevertheless let the Japanese staff be considered to be the best in English , no matter how good or bad his language skills are really . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

machine translation are also widespread - often with funny results .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ using and tra@@ itors sets that arise by machine translations , that this technique can still not replace a human translator . this is particularly true for some languages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the stran@@ gely English formu@@ lations in Japan , including the tra@@ itors print , often used T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be understood or even understood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo by Flickr user Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless . but by big companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards , one can expect more careful translations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city of Kyoto will hopefully be a serious source of translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and c@@ ens@@ ors on the Internet and TV
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ bo@@ con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to P@@ ren@@ sa y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ elan Internet users had no access to the online transmitter Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , other users wrote that the internet connection of V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV were also no longer accessible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also other online channels contributed to the protests in Caracas , which were organised by op@@ position@@ ist groups backed by the government of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the protests began early April , after the Supreme Court dismissed the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks on the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is linked to VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
# C@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that websites of Venezu@@ elan Provider once again are locked .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among the Veneti@@ ans with Internet access and especially in the times of un@@ rest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditional media have been delayed since 2014 with reporting about protests . then , the Commission threatened with monetary policy issues and closure if they continue to report on the demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have logged into @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net without cable TV and informative national television channels .
amazing that it continues to buy cheaper than just two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed later that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible through a locking of the domain name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also applies to the website , at which the National Assembly transfers their sessions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier surveys of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet provider may use DNS to respond to DNS servers of certain domains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds fla@@ wed or denied the request when calling such a website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third locked channel , the transfer was set off on Thursday , April 6th , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V @-@ c@@ ann Elvis Flo@@ res , who carried out the protests in Caracas live , was taken into custody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Flo@@ res was beaten while he was in custody in custody .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was released eight hours later , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V returned to the show again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although some channels are still accessible on YouTube , it was also reported that the government regul@@ ates internet links : thus the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ an@@ os will continue to increase access to multi @-@ media coverage about the current events in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a Report by Kur@@ turally , who is published by Global Vo@@ ices with friendly permission of the authors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the article is part of a series with the title &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ elan , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; F@@ ed cows , acc@@ ru@@ ding schools , &quot; ) which is edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she did not work together with the family who lived there , eating . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly before gradu@@ ating from the university , she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride over them . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the one has become something , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a has never been treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for her family . in Paraguay , one referred to the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money exc@@ els her under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter . in exchange the child eat food , an apprentic@@ eship and a roof above the head . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , what is not mentioned , is that the children will have to pay for many days of home@@ work that will never be paid and all this within the framework of a contract which you cannot lift . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay , this is known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go in Paraguay too because of its involvement and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organizations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after gradu@@ ating from his studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she spoke to Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected witness , resear@@ ched and p@@ ran@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tried to call things on behalf , as the feeling of gratitude , which is in@@ gh@@ ted to Cri@@ adi@@ tas , will certainly be silent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since one hand , the family , who can close their daughter in the faith that they can improve their position in society and make something out of itself , &quot; can pass a different family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the family bears the girl with herself and jus@@ ti@@ fies the exploitation by faith that they would not give you a chance , otherwise it would not be hungry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the girl is har@@ assed when the girl is har@@ assed , his family will learn about many years later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sometimes they never know about that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen households , but a face . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of heavy blows . shortly afterwards she died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o , who works as an official in the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira beat until they were killed with a stick on Mar@@ ín until they suffered fatal injury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported on the incident .
they con@@ cre@@ ted that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go &apos;s practice for the death of the girl .
they recorded the Cri@@ mean az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several dozen people came together to protest , and demanded that there are &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely distributed in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; compla@@ ined Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without papers it is much easier to hurt the rights of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the neighbors of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organizations require a quick review of the case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o for the murder of the girl , who was sentenced to 30 years in prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be landmark - if the first time in the history of Paraguay comes a case from Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as labour power , they also live isolated from other girls in their age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when her father worked for her father and lost her father and lost her father &apos;s work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their brothers had to work and began to sell , on the street or on the market sweets , to earn money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but they all went on to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital of As@@ unci@@ on in the capital of As@@ unci@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , she had to share the time so that you still had time to learn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was in every morning at five o &apos;clock , preparing the breakfast for their employers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Fri@@ days , for example , puri@@ fy the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished furniture and distill@@ ing the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the school was at the end , she went back home and had time to learn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more they had done with learning , the more leisure time she had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had hunger , but got no unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the library &apos;s library as eating out of the refrigerator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ ies of the Parti@@ do liberal , a Liber@@ al Party , who belonged to power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who belonged to power in 1954 until 1989 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some evenings of the house of Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a to stand up with him and Editorial from Op@@ position@@ ists , such as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , he tried to persu@@ ade them to make the reports of the official media through the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he held it for intelligent , but did not lie with her . &quot; the landlord had found someone who heard while talking about politics , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t allow me to visit my family because they had the opinion that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í , would speak at home once again their native language Guar@@ an@@ í . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Lord feared the formation that they had enabled her to lose again , explains them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it was completely clear that she had paid for everything she had paid with her hard work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discri@@ min@@ ated . &quot; a thing that is almost never spoken , are bul@@ lying and the ch@@ ic@@ ans to whom Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exposed to school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , a Cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not charge anyone home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends in school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my youth , in the time where friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I did not belong to any group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
the society pays the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group in which you can share vac@@ ancies for cleaning staff and children &apos;s cities in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

please contact you .
beginning from Monday when possible .
the display received five &quot; li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman from Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a el@@ dest girl , and gave her phone number . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 year old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; wrote her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third comment was written by &quot; a girl from the inland , who wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the recorded in the display was once again :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friends , I have found one . I look at whether it works with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

bill introduced Egyptian users social media to register with the government

sixty Egyptian par@@ liament@@ arians recently ordered a bill to agree with the Regulation in terms of use of social networks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he is adopted by Parliament , benef@@ ici@@ aries and users must register social media in Egypt to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , then a place would be set up to make use of the citizens to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within six months of adop@@ ting the law , users would have to register themselves on the website of the site with their right name and number ID numbers to be able to use social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will it be missed to do this , so that could bring a punishment of up to six months &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bill , which consists of six par@@ agra@@ ms and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application that runs through the internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , vide@@ ophone and text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not clear how the law is en@@ forced upon , as the draft does not exist , as the Egyptian government should not account for users to ensure that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure the regulation of social media companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad@@ Abdul Satt@@ ar , parliamentary and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a user name for users from the telecommunications bure@@ au and a password . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this could mean that Egypt plans to establish a fire@@ wall on national level around Facebook . because of them it would be necessary for Egypt , to submit information on their identity to access the network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s not known so far that such plans ins@@ ist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ics ( in German &quot; senior research Association &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights , &quot; said Global Vo@@ ices : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I doubt have greatly on technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt , concerning things that have to do with technology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they violent physical public and private rooms can also be done online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I take them seriously , it means that they want to apply a strong monitoring system to recru@@ it a permit or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the human being and also to bring them to a court process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be deb@@ ated by the parliamentary elections and the constitutional complaint before it goes to the deb@@ its . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft is to be maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ation of nar@@ ration on the image area is present , &quot; Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the MP El Sha@@ ha@@ w@@ y proposed a bill of law against Cy@@ ber @-@ crime , in which was found guilty of imprisonment for the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest &quot; to protest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this post by To@@ dd repent@@ bold was published in original at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high up in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the Tier@@ schutz@@ liga H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists of the NGOs work against the oc@@ er@@ ous Persian le@@ op@@ ard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a sub@@ type of the bigger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which erup@@ ted through Africa and Asia , belong to the Per@@ s@@ ish le@@ op@@ ard ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are often less loo@@ t due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why is this certain type of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Raz@@ a in the video shows , &quot; is the Per@@ s@@ ische Leopard the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ ors in the Kurdish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the immune system depends on that a large ro@@ b is present . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indeed , the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard is low and goes towards zero . when the team in the video presented it to a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a trained Bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a loves to see another side of her country that consists not only of war and conflict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for six years , she has been involved with field studies on wild animals and educational programs by Nature Iraq . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2013 , she has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group , and will make sure that protection zones for wild animals are set up in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; launched in early March 2017 , the daily Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o , the progress made in the last six years , resulted in a massive earthquake that prov@@ oked a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima disaster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai that is located in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a pre@@ f@@ ect of Japan in Japan . they had to experience the earthquake and resulting in the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ates were forced to ejac@@ ulate because the ts@@ un@@ ami had van@@ ished whole coastal cities from the map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima experienced a nuclear accident that alone had to leave 160 000 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the special report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o shows from a local view , which has been reached after six years to re @-@ establish the life of the town . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the detailed report of the paper includes both statistics of Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of the person concerned .
the accommodation facility in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ates
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of planned spare parts ( for@@ ce@@ as@@ k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate were finished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could record the largest success under the three pre@@ f@@ ecture , 80 percent of the planned spare parts were finished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ w@@ ate has produced 75 percent of these houses in the end of Fu@@ kus@@ hima with 70 percent the closing light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even six years after the disaster , the ev@@ acu@@ ated of accommodation units ( for@@ mid@@ able , Kaz@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) is still trying to be moved to final spare parts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after thre@@ e@@ fold disaster , almost 80 000 people were forced to live in accommodation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in December 2016 , 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such claims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost 40 percent of the year 2011 ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in shel@@ ters . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated , which were hau@@ led after the disaster in accommodation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for I@@ w@@ ata the number here is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung had been working , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools having been aff@@ licted by the disaster that accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ecture is more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost 100 per cent of the fish@@ eries in I@@ w@@ ata and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation again and only 30 per cent of the fish@@ eries were res@@ umed in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and nuclear accident occurred extensively in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear waste , as only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of de@@ ar@@ able farm@@ land from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , are located in the &quot; nuclear &quot; zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures the tourism has recovered much again , but Fu@@ kus@@ hima still remains un@@ defeated here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tourist tax in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ates are back as much as 90 percent in the same stand as before the mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hima , however , can only be 75 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal cities , it is more difficult to earn their living . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the local population preparing for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to determine an overall picture , the newspaper introduced numerous surveys under the local population and under the ev@@ acu@@ ated people . she ques@@ tioned about the status of reconstruction and also how their emp@@ ties has changed from the ts@@ un@@ ami risk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her introduction of the article the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspaper explains :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the local population in experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the survey brought that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures taken in order to be prepared for the upcoming earthquake and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents say that still did not be done enough in disa@@ sters health prevention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how it is to be ev@@ acu@@ ated by the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ f@@ ecture ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their edition of the earthquake , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has directed its attention also to the situation of the ev@@ acu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hima also had to witness the enormous earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima also witnessed the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear un@@ fail@@ ing to experience Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Fu@@ kus@@ hima almost 63 thousand people were transferred in areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of 2016 there were some more than 23 ,000 people back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima in permanent replacement houses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 2017 , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside of its home @-@ pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the cat@@ astrop@@ hic regions , most of the ev@@ acu@@ ated areas are still to compete in accommodation projects , because the efforts to compete in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ata and Fu@@ kus@@ hima will be competing for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ata and Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the World is small : our Podcast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when people meet people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences seem to be larger than the com@@ mon@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a while , however , one often recognizes that one more links than it seems at first sight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these global connections are important , as they demand our pre@@ judi@@ ces to expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look closely with these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast we discuss topics that get much less attention when reporting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember at a moment , in which they have felt very heavily linked to someone over language and borders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ver@@ on@@ iki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the com@@ mon@@ alities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man talks about the time when she worked with people from all over the world ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences that he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was hospit@@ alized this week , during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia during a protest march to a protest march . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has a skull of trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; physi@@ cians oper@@ ate him on this Saturday , and have now moved to a artificial comm@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
its condition is considered critical .
local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus that quickly spread in Brazil within a few days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the pictures , the face of the police officer is also identified by a hammer attack . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ a@@ io . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the incident , the military police arrested in the Brazilian federal state of Go@@ i@@ ás , that S@@ amp@@ a@@ io was suspended until gradu@@ ating from the active service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pictures show the police officers as he proposes in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his ra@@ vine on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a police officer l@@ acks a police officer and landing on the Inten@@ sive station , his face would be on television for six months and the whole op@@ pression would be justified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ ic@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , distributed as a Mat@@ eus by the police officers , and several medi@@ cs shortly after it hur@@ ry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another video with the same scenes , but from a different perspective , is also immersed in social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50th second .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users now have 10,000 Brasili@@ an Re@@ ais ( approximately 2,@@ 700 euros ) in order to keep a portion of the costs for medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia during which he is in hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .

on Facebook Professor Pablo Or@@ tel@@ la@@ do calls further non @-@ violence against activ@@ ist in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás experienced a wave of political force : here the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ hi@@ me Irish was murdered by his father because he has been attacked by a police force since he has been attacked by a police officer after he had been attacked by a police officer .
police transfer
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , where it came to brutal police lines against demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , demonstr@@ ators put a stage for speakers in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , a rubber bul@@ let and tear gas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the flagship of Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SOL ) , asked the police to refra@@ in on violence against prot@@ esters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once again , the Brazilian media street prot@@ ru@@ des demonstr@@ ating the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window disc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported specific about a bro@@ min@@ ent glass window in order to do illu@@ stra@@ tive with a photo of their title pages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a set @-@ on bus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to tell more about a broken window @-@ disk than the protests of the people , who serve the defense of a special cause . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this must also be recognized if you are strictly against any kind of property damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also here the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; ob@@ tains a absurd , disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violence of the military police are rooted in confron@@ tation with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on confron@@ tation with the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the forgotten villages in Cuba
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar mills included in Cuba are the doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , which is located in the western Cuban Province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - no matter what there are no significant sugar@@ s on site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities were paraly@@ zed in the sugar mills .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the gro@@ unding , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost and after its facilities , until only the frame remained of steel and concrete remained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about 27@@ 2 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changes rarely work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other re@@ signed and com@@ mute daily to the factories , which are still ma@@ ids . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , starts every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry don &apos;t ro@@ b his sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he heard that there are sugar mills in the east of the region , which are in operation after a long in@@ active time , because they were received . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ene reminds himself exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich would get the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sugar cane industry resist@@ ed the pla@@ gues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ effici@@ encies , the bad management decisions and climate change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 , the production of 1.6 million tonnes of sugar was produced , less than 1910 produced amount . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the news would have been a motive for rest@@ less for the country several decades , but the bad harvest didn &apos;t have any news anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old railway au@@ g of the church already saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refin@@ ing of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar@@ cane mills were technically ob@@ sol@@ ete , and hardly competitive , they were unbe@@ atable for the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initial idea was to focus on production on the most efficient factories , the annual production goal was 4 million tonnes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they only left the factories , which can produce sugar@@ s at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euros ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that lead to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plan@@ tations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless the sugar @-@ price increased from about a decade ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar@@ s between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os will remain per pound , according to the 2016 published by the OECD and FAO , the Agricultural and Food Organisation of the United Nations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar exports would generate approximately EUR 85 million for the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will go down to history with security in the history of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro , during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on the process of restructuring in the sugar industry started .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following years , a total of 98 sugar mills , over 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same happened at the Gregori@@ o factory Gregori@@ o Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if N@@ ene is known as a soldier , about the closure of the factory , the word , which he repeatedly does , is fraud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are in the same opinion : not one of them informed that the factory was shut down .
in order to obtain the place they formed a full time - working group .
before the first year of lovers began the first letters to come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was officially written documents that would only be removed in terms of parts that would be removed , addressing and date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ja Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from then on , the responsibilities and letters were more frequent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the still@@ ed factory two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country still had no money , &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
eddy Re@@ yes ( 64 ) years waiting for retirement in a different system that is Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was involved in the breast@@ feeding of the factory , whose construction he helped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 working years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most developed industrial area developed by Cuba and the most important wor@@ kt@@ ops was removed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in many cases , no alternatives for jobs and services have been generated in the municipalities that they were present . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will never know if during the mam@@ mot@@ h speech of 21 October 2002 , the former president in the eyes of the present persons , when he guaranteed that factories were no longer running for five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of sugar mills
sugar cane has only been extracted by the elections since 2004 .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after two years the community of Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for better when a factory is closed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the sugar cane graduated , or better said when they started , they also listened to asp@@ hal@@ ing the road , this dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without a work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they became spare parts .
without a prospective prospective , many young people also left the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area , a food factory was created whose production does not serve once for the supply of the community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant remains impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began working . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after forty days , Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty gave the old soldiers a pension of two thousand pes@@ o per month to spend the years in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin colour , small , with a few teeth and clear voice , is no re@@ tra@@ geous person , yet there is the lies that one told him not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have been aware of it for ten years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ene walks over 65 years in pension , not because it is missing from power , but because it is bitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

you@@ ths of the First Nations communities in all Canada deal with topics that are important for them . they do them with hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of walking workshops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour , workshop director mobile recording studios offer directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original workshops were led by the pedag@@ ogue David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and collabor@@ ated with ten Cre@@ e @-@ Hip @-@ Hop Group The North@@ stars together with the Cre@@ e hip @-@ hop @-@ hop @-@ group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the workshop is increasing that the young particip@@ ates in discussions such as &quot; cultural identity , speech , meditation , love , self @-@ acceptance , or whatever else comes in mind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos where the young people are the main actors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in British Columbia &apos;s Canadian province and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First nation tells the story of the Highway 16 and also called &quot; Highway of tears . &quot; on the almost two dozen women mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered .
the cases were largely un@@ solved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First nation uses the motive of a video player to con@@ vey how important to receiving traditional customs and customs , despite the influence of glob@@ alization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people do not always rule the languages of the First Nations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following song that Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation , the refra@@ in will be sung on Cre@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the young@@ sters involved a little help of Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ stars Hip Hop Group , who gave them a st@@ anza in the dial@@ ect of Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an is available in the heading , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sometimes I feel like I would ever be interested in myself
but I try to continue my days on Earth
that is the day when you take our cry
because we have lost our way to life as a youth
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I believe that we will rise up one day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t want to see how to live a bad life
so they can grow and headed by our youth .
thus they can do this for what they determines the Creator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the commentary volume , the reader and supporters of the Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also adds a post and adds the St@@ anz@@ as in si@@ ren@@ al ( which will also be published on his blog ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

plastic dishes ( in general ) out of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan you can see almost every restaurant of plastic dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , are in close proximity to the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin sandy pur@@ u ( designed , &quot; sculp@@ tural models of meals &quot; ) from each dish that is served in this restaurant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the customers can see these plastic dishes , and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a whole industry devoted to making these plastic dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district , there is a variety of these small companies that character@@ ize the German filmmaker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they couldn &apos;t even call them anymore . however , a new trend is transformed into current mobile accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the B@@ logger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now in the special sale : new with plastic rib@@ b@@ ons decorated cell@@ ars how they will be shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of these artificial foods have been transformed to kit@@ sch collectors , such as in this case : fridge magnets : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ Go fridge magnets for a new exhibition in Tokyo @-@ Station .
the new boom of the ess@@ ences will increasingly be more complex .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this case , a cave @-@ don ( a popular travel bowl with seafood ) has been transformed into a mobile support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile support .
we have also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is an apple which has held your cell phone :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile , this is already a great design . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and this is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the Comic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some mobile support and mobile designers allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case ik@@ ura and salmon is used , a favorite t@@ opping , which is served with white rice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is there someone who would say : &apos; Wow , cool , now I can upset my mobile with laughing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also accept a reduced form in order to surprise colleagues or family members .
our latest mobile phone support has the shape of mel@@ odic ice cream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and Hand@@ y@@ bands from dried salmon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic dishes can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow in case on Twitter to the has@@ h@@ tag #
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to learn more about the origin of this trends , this video gives you an insight into the district K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , which is devoted to the exposure of the restaurant industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in reports and foreign media on the not@@ orious &quot; struggle against drug trading &quot; in Mexico , the missing and killed killed only in statistics , but this does not reflect the scale of human tragedy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reporting on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , head of the victim of the Sin@@ al@@ oa , urged the stories of the victims of conflict in the background . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a day after a violent incident , somebody who have learned the sorrow and the churches that have learned to live with pain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , behind any bon@@ che there will be in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partner whose wounds may never heal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore the Mexican news portal Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ lia launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ er@@ a Vi@@ vi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; speaking with drug traffic@@ king ) that the victims will give up a voice and stories about human beings &apos; pro@@ secut@@ ors and anti@@ trust authorities .
Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project like this :
organised crime does not just fear us for our lives .
the effects are much deeper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , when shops close up because they are threatened by drug dealers and all municipalities need to drive many kilometres to buy something like milk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Pain of Vic@@ tims
a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ v@@ que c@@ ambi@@ an p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; as fear life &quot; ) tells about these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father known every weekend secret graves after his son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez that lost her father , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ew , had lost her father and two sisters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; as every Sunday we are preparing for the task that we have asked ourselves , go out and to the tom@@ bs that we loved to seek . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he should return again , but he never came back . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need education . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is also my mother , which is also here with me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the moment she has no revenues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will be the insurance of my Father , but they won &apos;t pay them out because they require a death certificate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
where should we get that ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ er@@ a Vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only have to show the faces that fear . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility , and the government guidance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ Y@@ HB , a reading of Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexico . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter in which form it occurs : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I know illness and sen@@ sing journ@@ alism for a few years now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I pass every day at newspaper ki@@ os@@ ken and see the title pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from files of specialists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it brings me from the version .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who ref@@ uted or sad . it seems like a lack of respect for the person , who once belonged to this body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she also writes :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks that he is great . and it is not normal that humans will hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of crimin@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , as if they have lost those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see our weakness , if stories are going to blo@@ t numbers on a statisti@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crime of people is incredible with me if the death of six individuals and the dis@@ appearances of 43 students in a neighboring village may be justified &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they are trying to talk about such trage@@ dies , if they don &apos;t touch and are silent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the main district . &quot; in this she describes how an family was destroyed by threats of her business until the end was not only destroyed by her business but also her family apart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you think of everything you have lost and how many people can change your whole life in just a few days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pain about it never fails , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
habits have changed changed , phone numbers also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we only contact us if it &apos;s absolutely necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more we are removed from each other , the better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she concluded her report with the words :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they are killing or kill you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I asked me to dissolve my deepest emotions , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the &quot; forgotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ence &quot; by violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the introduction he has asked questions about how , who cares about the child of a mis@@ erable wife and a man who was murdered by organised crime ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of Mexico &apos;s most dangerous town ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents are concerned about them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Br@@ yan is a f@@ ather@@ less and he told it to teach himself how to make a egg , potatoes , tor@@ tillas warm and &quot; ch@@ ich@@ i &quot; for the babies . this is his name for the preparation of the vial with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tells about the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy , which consists of violence and the learning to live thereby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his childhood was already past two years earlier than he saw only a few blocks from his home , the bloody body of his father , who was shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when Br@@ yan was born in Br@@ yan the situation looked like in Ju@@ á@@ rez :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence was organised by organised crime and fight against the existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of charges of public safety and government government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 , the Public Prosecutor had 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to an average of 8,5 Mor@@ ons per day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are just some of thousands of thousands of stories , which leave the organized crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate the country &apos;s soul . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only a few stories live in view of the head@@ lines , but this project reminds us of those who we have not forgotten . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ er@@ a Vi@@ vi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ tico has created the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traffic@@ king over the past four decades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; Sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by the Flickr user Nikl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages where it is linked to which he is shown on which violence is shown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact check is important at a moment , in which it &apos;s about to raise a rum@@ or or fal@@ si@@ fication of fal@@ si@@ fication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but how is the years being immersed for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , ten@@ ds to pass further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since its first publication , it has been used to capture trage@@ dies , trage@@ dies , which actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this mis@@ pairing of picture and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; incorrect context &quot; in termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - den@@ ies no more careful coverage of events in the DRC , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions to our desire for pictures to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 , a tan@@ ker wag@@ ered the place of San@@ ge in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted and explo@@ ded . 230 people died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been negle@@ cted and thereby devast@@ ated . the roads in the region have become dangerous paths full of pot@@ holes that were difficult to drive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
trag@@ ically the tank truck fell victim to the victim .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; administration officials described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses , including a cinem@@ as near , which was full of people who showed the football world championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
houses of buried and char@@ tered cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to dis@@ comfort .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a picture with the title &quot; That is Nigeria . &quot; by Im@@ g@@ ur users My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12th January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident represent the horrible scenes of this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of glu@@ ed body that are lev@@ elled on the ground while they look at them .
but here the story does not find its end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the years , the same photo was ti@@ pped several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , but real , not related to the trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 the fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the emp@@ t@@ ying villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
ey@@ e@@ witnesses reported dramatically of atro@@ cities where they had to flee .
houses and stores were burned down and dead bodies were burned in streets and bus@@ hes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were reports , which were massac@@ red by 150 to 2,000 people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; no one remained back to count bodies , &quot; said a People to Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were dis@@ member@@ ed or shot or burned .
only from satellite images the following time could be visually displayed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the army point in Bagh@@ dad was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt at the B@@ oko Har@@ am country ( examples from the year 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and here the picture of the DR Congo appeared again , as evidence of the fact and possible extent of the attack was presented : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the picture from the DR Congo is only one in a number of false descriptions ; Africa Check has documented access to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all these cases , the picture was presented as a cover for mass oils . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another step further adds personal comments such as this example , fal@@ sely explained the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture from San@@ ge occurred in Myanmar in conjunction with the deadly prosecution of Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a flash drive , published by the United Nations , those who flee blows , rape and several dead , some by burning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while others reported on violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts such as the following on that these descriptions were brought together with photos from the DRC : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this picture comes from a Saudi @-@ Arabian news page , which testi@@ fied in 2012 , the President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ a Being told about the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to captiv@@ ate this information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original fee , which was picked up on 26 April 2017 , can be called here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other news organizations , the AF@@ P as their source were also fal@@ sely attributed to this statement , but had not associated with the image from the DRC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the global range of false information
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traces of these wrong cuts extend to the years 2011 and 2012 , and actually come from all over the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using a &quot; reverse picture search &quot; you can see how far more information can be exceeded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a reverse picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures under 18.@@ 8 billion pictures , which are very similar to the first picture taken from the DR Congo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they come from a mixed lot of private parties , platforms of social media and communities as well as national publications and are in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some have for@@ warded false reports , they have tried to un@@ mask the fal@@ si@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have bor@@ dered examples of mis@@ use and they are linked to the respective countries , on which side they had been published , and thus we want to display the range clearly than by the language alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the listed countries listed below ( which in some cases were also associated with each other ) , several examples of impro@@ per use can come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some cases which can now be felt entirely ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News frames .
country examples of false cou@@ plings of the picture from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the orange countries refer to pages or servers , over the examples of fal@@ si@@ fication or fal@@ se@@ hood are still available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the countries in Grau are examples that are available according to the metadata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also for@@ gery examples . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a reminder the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma @-@ Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture from the DRC was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeria and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even within Nigeria , the photo taken from the DR Congo is a evidence of the bombing of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in Kan@@ o in public discussion forums . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this news page claimed that the president of Myanmar Th@@ ein was unanim@@ ous in 2012 that mon@@ ks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , and brought the story together with the image from San@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the article has been updated in 2014 , and at the time of this publication , the picture is still contained in it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Spain / 2016 / 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this article by 2014 on students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Catholic close news page An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly explained that the picture was not taken from the k@@ illings , but it asser@@ ts that it was a &quot; similar d@@ jihadi@@ st attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the picture passed into circulation with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to resist the connection with Nigeria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they wanted to achieve that their communities took these events , the alleged in the name of Islam@@ s , a greater attention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
United States , 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture was we@@ ath@@ ered as a proof for the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 , but the messages that were associated with it , were taken up in any religious context . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , the goal was to raise awareness to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a message , written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Pascal &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , discussion about this here on Vietnamese and explained it to the Fal@@ con . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the message that included the picture from the DR Congo , the Organization of Clar@@ et@@ iner Mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Martos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are further examples of an incorrect use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( in the folder in Grau ) , Tin@@ Eye shows no longer fully trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time / date post@@ mark exist on the web @-@ craw@@ ler and they have image data in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all these cases , the picture has only been published after 2010 , the picture finally bears a correct description , but the original fee is not available or accessible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
frames and pictures
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two strong themes or frames , framed by this posts . the first frame focuses on religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the photo was used in relation to major discussions on silence in connection with the assassination of Christians through Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims , the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as through Budd@@ hi@@ sts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a second fragment uses the image to discuss , like an African life , compared to a European or French life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religion do want to understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth to examine how pictures in connection with these efforts will be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a deeper question is what happens if readers can no longer serve faith in these pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with social media , there are many people suffering from un@@ inten@@ tionally to share the water around a tragedy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggests this mood of false and false information , that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and tasted it the actual horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an argument is that the with@@ holding of images of a ref@@ usal is equivalent to recognize the tragedy . sometimes , these pictures are demanded even by the victims itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , the concern is that violent images reader and viewers des@@ ensi@@ ze and emp@@ athy the ability to emp@@ athy ( as for example this study , investig@@ ating how violent media influence others ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while there are things to be discussed in the news media in terms of non@@ violent represent@@ ations , fact it is essential for today &apos;s news coverage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Techn@@ ologists experiment with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . you will need to think about the situation in which a picture of which is a bit suggests , but it can be solved in the context or on completely ab@@ used species . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
any investigation of false supplements should also be considered internationally as internationally .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. un@@ bri@@ ck@@ able ) stri@@ ves to provide language thr@@ ills a selection of words from all over the world , which are difficult or not to translate at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such words are in each language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these un@@ bri@@ able words are already well known today ( as the famous Portuguese acid ) and others , that are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly each attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a word or an expression is not enough , why a full explanation , and sometimes a bit of context is needed to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these unique words have been collected for a full time in an online list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird has decided to focus on small languages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the blog , you can find example words from the VAT of V@@ anu@@ atu , such as : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Stri@@ ve your parents in recognition of it , as they have tried in your younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or la@@ z@@ iness which makes you feel during the cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they ent@@ ail other cultures and reveal other thoughts and aw@@ aken our curiosity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes you influence how we analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page , and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speakers of the &quot; Treas@@ ure languages , &quot; which are appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how Sri Lanka is moving with the worst floo@@ d@@ disaster of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka is currently the worst flood and land@@ slide catastrophe in this decade .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a statement of the cat@@ astrop@@ hic city of Sri Lanka , 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundred people will be missed due to the floods and mud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100 000 people were brought to 304 safe stays . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rain falls declined on Saturday ( 27th May ) , and the water conditions in some areas went slowly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still un@@ accessible areas .
the following images and videos con@@ vey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
flood floo@@ ding in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water stands of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am ants and Sri Lanka Twe@@ et deliver regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the has@@ h@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the degree of disaster .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today in the morning , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in the flood , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded the water@@ p@@ eg@@ els of Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Air Force has five air@@ planes for rescue operations , and another five are finished for transport of emergency deliveries to the residents included in their flooded villages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
various organizations and star@@ tu@@ ps have also provided themselves to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od V@@ IC@@ TI@@ MS in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka deliver important information on flood situation and humanitarian aid .

for all who want to don@@ ate dry foods and the necessary goods for flood victims -

Tax@@ at@@ u@@ f App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asked people to share their sit@@ ing data with the help of the app so that the cat@@ ast@@ op@@ sy centre will be informed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year after the Trop@@ enst@@ ur@@ ms Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; high water remedy &quot; button which allowed the users to pick up a vehicle for pick @-@ up assistance and donations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as well , they introduced a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button which resulted in more than thousands of en@@ quiries and 150 successful boat rescue operations for flood @-@ water and drow@@ ned people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , with which several social media platforms are fully exploited , people in need in need of safety and provide assistance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this prevents loss of other human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to recover the norm@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ ha@@ zi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permission was approved in January at Women &apos;s March in San Francisco , with a neighbour in and love girlfriend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I trust my four years old daughter , familiar to me her children ; she is my rock in the surf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in one minute we call Par@@ ole for the rights of women .
in the next sk@@ ies we tend right to trans@@ gender .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a sea of umbre@@ llas and people , some keep the iconic image of a woman with head@@ scarf high , bound from an American flag , others an@@ gled par@@ ol@@ es against Islam@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend look at me and says : &quot; these things are not concern you , or ? &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; I wonder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already run this entertainment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people with whom I work or people who have known me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar , who know them - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built herself in their imagination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they dispos@@ ed me of Muslim .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice ourselves differently from religion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , in different kind . but somehow we are all put in the same Muslim drawer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drawer is well constructed in our collective idea of such a well that as soon as Muslims , who are not able to fit in Muslim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be mis@@ mi@@ zed by the Muslim Brotherhood
I &apos;m not alone .
this has even happened to the poet whose poetry is the best selling in America : Rum@@ i .
which images are coming to one in the sense when you think of it ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as J@@ al@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Islam , the Kor@@ an and Prophet Muhammad , were up to the day that he died , the centre of his poetry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the Western concept the religion was deleted , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this del@@ etion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists of the reducing images of Muslims ; the western books have been colonial since centuries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this temp@@ ting picture language is determined by the dark man , which should fear and the exotic woman should save one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ground@@ breaking Palestinian scientist Edward Sa@@ id , in the 1970s , took the story behind these pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but these images also stick out today .
our politicians and the news industry and Hollywood continue to exp@@ ose them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have worked for three years in the news industry and I have seen such powerful , incorrect nar@@ rative of our news@@ feeds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this nar@@ rative over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed the reality that have led to nine Muslim women in the last three decades , while the United States did not even choose their first female presidential candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this nar@@ rative fails to recognize that when French , Muslim women are forced to prevent their head@@ scarf by their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a powerful group ex@@ erts its &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; others . &quot;
this strong nar@@ ra@@ tively weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it looks like that the first Muslim prayers were spoken to the American soil of Afri@@ cans , which were brought here with slaves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this nar@@ rative has been deeply damaged by our collective imagination , often S@@ ik@@ h men and children to target an@@ tim@@ us@@ li@@ mic attacks and sho@@ ot@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of these stories we tell and due to the nature we tell them is Islam@@ opho@@ bia today is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion
in the news industry we do more than just tell stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also create nar@@ ra@@ tives , which help us understand the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and yet my industry has failed to failed to capture the nar@@ rative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims comprise the highest grade &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ armed Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to immigrants from the first generation to come from 77 countries .

four decades ago my first parents came to New York to live in order to live their American dream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my mother laid her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue , and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then , when Khan imag@@ ined the Sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were inevitable Muslims and Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but am I a serious Muslims and an American woman ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , when I wonder why I don &apos;t eat pork meat , I say - instead of catching my Muslim recipes or do my hand pick@@ pocket , who carry all Muslims with themselves - &quot; from respect to Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am j@@ okes ; we do not wear all the pick@@ pocket with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must also be no the@@ ological experts in order to be &quot; Muslim , &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional safety checks from the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who endeav@@ or to fight far from Islam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these lies are produced on the current band of a well @-@ formed Islam@@ ist machinery , which is already faulty picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is manipul@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the stories we tell and due to the nature , in which we tell them , Islam@@ ism exists in more than a stranger that breaks down the head@@ scarf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

I want to explain this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was born as Muslims , but a Muslim was born in my imagination , when I was four years old in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if social scientists describe religious life , they discuss the following terms : believe , behavior and affili@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Muslim faith and behavi@@ ors are perhaps not always visible , but they are there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe my girlfriend , my neighbor to see my rock in the surf , that I am Muslims when she could separate our houses with the 15 metres of concrete and air . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would see the ordinary ritual with my daughter when I kept them in my arms , and her the Arabic verses , which are called the Kor@@ an , and called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every one of them I repeat three times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one can &apos;t see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Muslim faith is not always visible , but my Muslim sub@@ ordination is always part of my shadow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be the Muslims in it , as she taught me to come to God , Allah is God , my only Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a people who was colon@@ ised by a &quot; Imperial @-@ British Eastern Ost@@ ini@@ ums @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning to name God , my only Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; belonging to affili@@ ation means to grow and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time to see that my deb@@ ated grandfather wept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of the modern Islam and when he writes about the modern Islam and about the independence of Kas@@ h@@ irs , N@@ ana Ja@@ an in@@ quired about his family in the half century was not allowed to close his arms in half a century . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; belonging to affili@@ ation is that there are millions of Kurds and Palest@@ inians , whose families were torn apart from col@@ oni@@ alists who have divided the Muslim world as their risk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be Muslims in the last two centuries , Europeans have been colon@@ ised by four Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means to know , that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was rejected by a Muslim country over a Muslim country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , a Indian , k@@ asch@@ al sub@@ tan of the British Empire , led by the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous . &quot; since he led the first mosque in England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to my Muslim trunk of 1,7 billion people , deeply moved into our unforgettable family rooms ; our un@@ locked history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means that four@@ teen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops that were distributed over every continent apart from the Ant@@ ar@@ ctic , to hunt weapons of mass destruction that did not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried beneath the ruins of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be an American Muslims , knowing that the suicide rate has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means knowing that if a tragedy goes up the US and carries the susp@@ ects a Muslim name , history is four times more reported than a story with a white attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means to know that four@@ teen years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liberated black slaves with the name of Bil@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means to know that two hundred years ago a African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought into this country .
it means Malcolm X to call a American hero .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the warmth , which I feel , when people filled the airports to fight against Muslim B@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the hope that I feel , when we get up for our dreams and if we say black life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an American woman , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Muslim and a journalist , does not fail to fail to further communicate with multiple bin@@ ders , but to others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the nar@@ rative of the 1.7 billion hi@@ des more possibilities than a mag@@ ician , but is represented in the reduced bi@@ dity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be a mother to take me to care of my child and all Muslim children , knowing that power@@ fully and privileged persons have built on this bi@@ dity of structural Islam@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; structural Islamic @-@ hos@@ tility consists in Muslim Regi@@ ons , which began with President Bush and under President Obama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it exists in the immigration li@@ aison who takes five years old child in hand cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in a country that involves its borders toward people from the countries , which are bom@@ bed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ Fly list , &quot; which takes mostly Arabs and Muslims into visual acu@@ ity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the wars which we lead and the bombs , which we reject Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the stories we tell and thanks to those who we do not tell , we are here today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , researchers at North@@ western University showed a scientifically un@@ true image and b@@ ates them , groups on a scale ranging from 1 to 100 in terms of evolution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conver@@ sations we must guide
we are too deeply dar@@ ing to sof@@ ten the Muslim or the &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we stand for decades back to recognize the roots of our fears and the incorrect and dangerous expressions , that we are in our news editorial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims in the media industry that attempts to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Podcast Lake SO@@ ME@@ TH@@ ING , Say SO@@ ME@@ TH@@ ING by Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the Podcast # Good@@ Muslim Brotherhood ; S@@ app@@ el@@ o Square via black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Muslim , Muslim Super hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I am concerned with this difficult global time , where we are located . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and this moment has consequences which go out over 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a reason that con@@ spir@@ ators theore@@ ti@@ cian , which existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now lead the White House . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have grown exp@@ on@@ ential because they did Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yet another group , which has grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally , has created the &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few years ago , it had not yet been given her ; now they domin@@ ate great areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am concerned about the re@@ alities and the history , which I was not aware of when I was so old now , as it is now my daughter , but I &apos;ve made me of an un@@ question@@ ing Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
things which I leave here like a sandwich spread in my speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things that may aw@@ aken memories , as in all the inter@@ section that makes our humanity out , likes to listen to a story where someone is made to another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , Con@@ versa@@ tions take place under the 8th Annual Conference of Islamic hos@@ tility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than hundred ac@@ adem@@ ics speak about our problems with the &quot; others , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these are not terms , with whom we usually throw in our schools or read that in our newspapers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do I tell Stan@@ ford this T@@ ED@@ X Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward Sa@@ id , who has shown us how war will be guided to us and people by the work of the &quot; others &quot; in the public performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of it , consci@@ ously and un@@ consci@@ ously the &quot; other &quot; as we have no president in which we have no president in which we have already captured a new future with the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for nar@@ rative : preserve urban diversity
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell stories about Flickr @-@ User Daniele Rossi , using the License CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can there be a way , here and now in spite of a language barrier with someone in connection ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) , the story of stories in their original language is a possible answer to this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
global Vo@@ ices reported about another initiative by Steven Bird on a brief initiative by Steven Bird .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but in the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve the language diversity of great cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS had been doing events , the risk that small and not quite as small languages are not shared to the children born there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the makers of the project :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mass mortality of the world may be avoided if we don &apos;t need to accept cities , which don &apos;t have to forget those who are inhabitants to keep them up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while listening often , it is often related to understand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check these events instead &quot; to appreciate to feel , to connect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers will first put their story in their own language and translate them in English . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if the participants are not professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their dev@@ otion and their representation will cause the listen@@ ers to be attached to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they call for laughter and emotions when the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following video shows for example a traditional story of Burkina Faso , which will be told in the language of Daf@@ ing . during this round the story nar@@ rative of Ras@@ si@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the nar@@ rative of nar@@ ra@@ tives for their country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another event , John Ny@@ ug@@ ara tells the st@@ ings of the bun@@ ny and the Pa@@ vian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after expla@@ ining the meaning of his fa@@ bel , John Ny@@ ug@@ ara will speak : &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that does not understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in@@ sen he divi@@ des his feelings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have heard !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling took place in three cities and the organis@@ ers hope to extend this . all that are inspired by the project can be in contact with T@@ LS in order to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ ellers .
Puerto Rico calls for the United States of re@@ mission of sovereign debt
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the aim of a new examination of Puerto Rico public debt , the March 3 , 2017 , various religious and civil organizations participated in a mass demonstration ; the march started at the pu@@ ert@@ orial Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went to Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Citi@@ front for the Neur@@ examination of the debt ) and the Ö@@ kom@@ en@@ ic Church Convention Puerto Rico . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the advoc@@ ate of the debt of debt has also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is their demand :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people of Puerto Rico demands that politicians , banks and government agencies who are responsible for debts are responsible for their corrupt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we demand financial verification and a management committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding re@@ mun@@ eration , in favour of economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are pressed and supp@@ ressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people of Puerto Rico ref@@ uses to pay a debt , which is not their . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to reach their pension payments .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not in the state @-@ conc@@ ession of the United States - suff@@ ers from a severe financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a ruling non @-@ profit organisation without party affili@@ ation with focus on soci@@ o@@ economic development , a law for state responsibility , as an alternative to existing state views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of government infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the measures imposed by the outside will be imposed without the participation and convic@@ tion of citizens , from the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demonstration carried a name &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Syrian Palestinian web developer Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , has been missed for over a year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than five years after he was arrested from the Syrian regime , his supporters and their families continue their freedom and remember the contributions that he did for an open network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this year &apos;s re : pub@@ lica , annual conference on digital culture that will be hosted in Berlin , dedicated himself to the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the French CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara Ru@@ hl@@ ing , CEO of Book Cost of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive In@@ quiry within three to five days , read excer@@ pts from the book cost of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the book that was published last year and is licensed for free , contains a number of articles that deal with free culture in the face of op@@ pression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it says :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this book aims to discuss how movements for free knowledge are being built and what the true costs are , with which this is connected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers , researchers and writers , who are involved in the movements for free knowledge , have seen our news@@ feeds and create something sense from our different experiences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his name was painted from the directory of the A@@ dra Pr@@ ison , where he sat on 3 October 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , we have no information about his current state or residence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Colle@@ ctive memory gives his friends and his family a voice to push for his release , and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to see how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us begin to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , deeds and decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why Are We Here ?
what did we decide for ?
what did we give up extreme beliefs in this process ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in prison by Syrian government agencies , since March 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra @-@ prison , a non @-@ military facility to an unknown place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his wife , the writer and lawyers N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi reported that the &quot; military police force bases on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; commander of the military court in A@@ dra had carried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ ha@@ zi reported that they were contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 , who ordered themselves as in@@ sider of the Assad government and put them informed of a alleged death sentence against her husband . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but his place of stay and condition remains unknown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a pioneer in Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel plays a decisive role to extend access to the public and to know public in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a Designer , Techn@@ ologist and currently over the ladder of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project established in Bas@@ sel , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps there was none of Bas@@ le cultural prototypes looking ahead as the work , which he started using a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to recre@@ ate the ancient ruins Pal@@ my@@ ras . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross of numerous civi@@ liz@@ ations and summar@@ ies Greek @-@ Roman architectural types with hi@@ es@@ y traditions and Persian influences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bas@@ sel could not yet know that ten years after he began to put all these architecture , this architecture that is not only em@@ bodies the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens , but of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this strip in digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time cartridge that will be the public , as well as for scientists and artists in the future of in@@ valuable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
trag@@ ically Bas@@ sel could not shut down this project so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband , to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have spent my overall life to dream of freedom , and Bas@@ sel taught me to embrace her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med by when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel gave me English as he was already in custody .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have learned to read , write and speak English . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who has asked , to write and speak other prisoners of English . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bas@@ sel opened me the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has also taught other prisoners to use computer , at least in theory , without that they actually held one in their hands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a Pro@@ clam@@ ation , which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 , when he was in custody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bas@@ sel and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for a year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him , when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

it happens at every visit .
that I sin@@ king in the world of your enchanting eyes .
that I loose the spi@@ der at the moment in which we embrace us .
that any of the dangers do not matter .
each of the f@@ ences and sh@@ ac@@ kles
I forget the commem@@ oration of the prison
and I penet@@ rate every detail of your voice and words .
to me I carry with passion .
if your eyes say goodbye
and I leave another piece of my soul in you ...
I quickly back to my sol@@ itude .
to retrieve all those moments .
and smile on your absence to we@@ ep and smile .
I bear myself that I will return soon ...

Bas@@ tion &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the 2011 protests against Bas@@ har al @-@ Ass@@ ads , the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian network for human rights ) has disappeared more than 6@@ 5.000 people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who were arrested , or under violence through the regime , were tor@@ tured or executed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until 2016 , Am@@ nesty International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrian refugees since 2011 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bas@@ sel since 2012 .
we repeat today our demand in hope that we must do this for the last time .
Mozambique : due to corruption condemned director to un@@ predic@@ table post office
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims responded to anger over a corruption case , where a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a , which was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years imprisonment together with four other def@@ endants for dis@@ covering 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( approx . 800 000 Euros ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the money came from public funds in the airports of Mozambique , whose advice was CFO Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a between 2005 and 2008 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a was released for a good lead in 2016 and immediately requested his re@@ mark to the company , which was done on April 19 then . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in accordance with a statement of the general general rule of the Republic , who suff@@ ers the proposal , there would be no obstacle to his old post , since the company had not completed a disciplinary procedure after his imprisonment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but many people don &apos;t fulfil the action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the centre for public integrity ( Centr@@ o de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution which sett@@ les into public transparency in an interview with Deutsche Welle , condemned the director again : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; provides a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and illustrates the absence of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression regarding the efforts of our legal system , the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we need to know , is that the company should have direct a disciplinary procedure against the contradi@@ ctions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the firm , however , apparently , does not require adequate steps to use the corresponding functions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , ref@@ uses this behavior and considers the case as &quot; disgu@@ sting &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a would be a competent type , he would have been counsel@@ ed after he was sentenced to half a prison , and half has taken away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could have paid speech@@ es and motiv@@ ating speech@@ es he could be advised and his image polish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has granted to re@@ integrate into the company which he helped to add damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a is fond of for his silence .
res@@ isti@@ ble !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says , the director occupied no moral . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a is rewarded by the State , because he ins@@ ul@@ ted him . I can &apos;t believe that someone has rewarded someone in such way which the state already has taken a massive reward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a l@@ acks the mor@@ als and serve to the state , * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only granted themselves to the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a used the state as it became an in@@ exhaus@@ tible money source , and the state itself is we@@ ary of this man , who was charged and ultimately sentenced to a long prison sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hon@@ estly I don &apos;t know why this man is so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ t fav@@ es it to remember the prime minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remember that a th@@ ief has heard into prison :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , not only remain the first independent president in memory , but also as sharp , in@@ fil@@ ler and inci@@ dentally - prophes@@ y speakers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations , when he was energetic that &quot; an ambitious person , also being able to sell his own ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sam@@ ora said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person is changing , my experience is not that . he changes the tac@@ tic , but he does not turn away from its ambi@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an ambitious person is criminal . &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored by many users
the generic word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chick@@ peas or cra@@ y@@ fish .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to data on Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took its posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people East indi@@ an origin or generally used as an ad@@ jective &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a part of an initiative in Bur@@ m@@ ese Scrip@@ tures , Facebook cen@@ sored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar , &quot; as a part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of h@@ ass@@ le in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements have given an extremely ab@@ ag@@ ious con@@ notation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , it is a word that mostly commonly used by Ultra nation@@ alists as H@@ ass@@ le against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the effort to fight H@@ ass@@ in in Myanmar , the company has cen@@ sored a lot of sensible content on its platform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Kal@@ ar is usually associated with racism today , but the word in itself does not automatically call H@@ ass@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that too , in which they have discussed the word or doubts about his use of use , cen@@ sored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , there are several bur@@ mes@@ ical words with different mean@@ ings that have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , chair on Bur@@ m@@ ese is also written as &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ cr@@ ater A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at stated the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however he had asked his friends on a spiritual way , if they were calling , how he could left his back pain by making a word game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ku of la - &quot; He@@ aling &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ically - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were various reactions to the Facebook initiative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ in win is the opinion that it is a radical nation@@ alist , but it also stressed that Facebook must be analytical to spread all posts operating in the sus@@ pic@@ ion of racism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook is del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it automatically filters the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on fac@@ et .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what it should do instead , is to analyze the post carefully and check it by checking the words there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( switches ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the good is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread H@@ ass@@ ar , receive a pretty good lesson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is now at the time to circumc@@ ise its nation@@ alism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the action is able to send a strong signal to all , the h@@ ass@@ le should spread the efficiency of this strategy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the experience of social networks in China , such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have demonstrated that the c@@ ens@@ orship of keywords often become a cat and mouse game , whereby the user of social networks can be simply start to express their views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described , as Facebook began to delete his posts , when he wanted to tell his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is ban@@ ished from social network : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; when I was attentive to this new directive of Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ir@@ on@@ ically my post office was removed from Facebook , and I was forbidden to sub@@ mitting the lic@@ as , post and share of content for 24 hours , because the post is not saying &quot; the Facebook community standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook has a variety of posts from people who don &apos;t have any negative intentions , or who simply try to show their opinions about the radical nation@@ alists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick Murphy wrote , that his post was removed , who has nothing to do with H@@ ass@@ ar : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mail without H@@ ass@@ le from Facebook .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the post , the author shared his opinion why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more than the beginning of the initiative , for example , the Bur@@ m@@ ical Internet community for advice : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook may have a pleasant intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform , but it does not work like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as such words , there will only be more hatred within the different communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it seems as if they started without local context or technical support and have forbidden words as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; her@@ edi@@ cur@@ ry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even when they found out that they did not have made mistakes , they did not try to correct the f@@ eit@@ ful posts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits , that would have a big turnover , it would be great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fac@@ ebooks automatic c@@ ens@@ orship has cat@@ ered for much s@@ caff@@ old among users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of taking serious , users now make fun and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of H@@ ass@@ language to see if their posts will be taken from the grid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook Po@@ sts that contained no H@@ ass@@ le but were nevertheless removed :

the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and take a look at her@@ cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alistic ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to enhance their voices and their influence has increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among other things , H@@ ass@@ ar should also heat up violence in Myanmar in addition to domestic violence , especially in the area Rak@@ h@@ ine where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to escape . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook was cri@@ tici@@ zed for his failure , the hat@@ ched h@@ ass@@ les on his bur@@ m@@ ical sides under control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but instead of getting the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have better looked at the context than on code concentrated initiatives and learned from them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the inf@@ og@@ amy is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament unanim@@ ously approved a law which aims to offer this practice so that its age is now at 18 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before this change of divor@@ cement , some members were held in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mah@@ ar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state did not inter@@ fere , since that , at age , not the irrit@@ ations said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this happened un@@ noticed by the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contra@@ cting party of UN children &apos;s rights , the min@@ ors , every man under the age of 18 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who had already been married to 15 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago amounted to 8.1 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical central office confirmed that in 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements who endeav@@ oured to abol@@ ish laws on the children &apos;s foot , followed at the foot and er@@ ring large support . undoubtedly , they hal@@ ted this result . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless not everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Hindu leader , for example , had no concerns , the critics of the children &apos;s before , they should be sure to take care of their own business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of religious opposition was in fact un@@ complicated cause of tensions in this actually un@@ complicated cause , and sometime it would doubt if the Opposition would agree with the bill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in early 2017 the bill was decided against the children &apos;s before - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which could ab@@ stain from the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , only the president of the country must agree and bring the law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s Sen@@ ators gave a status update to Facebook which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle had again posted on Inst@@ agram :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against Child before was approved in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes , and not one single against it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; having decided before in the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of social media users were thr@@ illed , because the laws were finally changed to the inf@@ og@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook member Lov@@ ely Francis who was held in the Ministry of Education at the Ministry of Education :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has a lot of time and unnecessary sound needed to wear the core of the thing , but know what ? the inf@@ og@@ amy is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and this is almost worth every price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during Abel Jackson in my opinion , it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
public Status update on Facebook from L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas who says : News , herr@@ ing News !
the marriage was decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 instead ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who listened to Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society that spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was noted : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the age of age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the design to change the spouse was decided today , on June 9 , 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were 41 members in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 were present at the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the dep@@ u@@ ties , which were against the law , voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inf@@ ancy is legally not allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # child@@ mar@@ ri@@ age@@ Gu@@ abuse .
many thanks to all activists who have fo@@ aled him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our dep@@ u@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yet a possible hook comes in the shape of Satellite Mah@@ ar@@ aj , the Secretary @-@ General of San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hindu organisation in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; months ago Mah@@ ar@@ aj has announced his intention to take judicial steps , the law should be adopted , and he now seems to dissolve his promise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the general prosecutor of Paris Al ra@@ wi , a supp@@ orter of the law , said that it was entirely legal when Mah@@ ar@@ aj was accused against the law , the most social media users wanted to change the debate differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell proposed :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear Sat , if we don &apos;t think of the discussion so common in a way that only panic and ignorance can say that they may be ab@@ used by big , hard @-@ called men who have been ab@@ used against them , would you be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or do you believe this is not a problem ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but whether it comes to a judicial procedure against the law or not , this legislation is still an important step - however , there are still places around the world where the inf@@ alli@@ ances are legal or still the norm , although there are laws which they teach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

through the mirrors of websites you can watch online content on Wikipedia &apos;s content
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 18 January 2012 , the English Wikipedia page was shown on the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the USA , internationally bl@@ acked out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for more than a month , Turkey closed the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pa@@ edia Wikipedia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a day by day is more evident , as important as the platform for users to find helpful and reliable information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series are fighting against the locking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although many talented Internet users are used to use envelop@@ ing tools for blocked websites ( a current article from the New York Times ) reported that Turkey &apos;s third largest VPN pre@@ valence does not fall into this category . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Turkey has been locked in Wikipedia for 2008 , as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University has been published , where the Internet law has been adopted ( No. 56@@ 51 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to China , Turkey is the best known country in the world when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the platform continues to remain closed , several mir@@ ror@@ sites ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and are often updated ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform based all Turkish Wikipedia sites to its de@@ centr@@ alized Peer @-@ to @-@ Peer @-@ network ( i.e. calcul@@ ator computer machines ) and thus makes a complete c@@ ens@@ orship difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the content is available in spite of legal ban .
in a blog post : IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after we have heard the news ( via the lock of Wikipedia ) , we put all the snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the content of de@@ centr@@ alized and distributed way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can help users to look at least all Wikipedia content , even if you cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IP@@ FS also announced that this step was independently carried out of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Wik@@ im@@ edia involved in other efforts to b@@ ypass the lock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni of Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ z@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , an open source project that everyone can use to ho@@ ist similar Mir@@ ror@@ Pages if it is locked up in the respective country of Wikipedia .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported the Sub@@ has@@ h@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member as well as employees at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open speaks of &quot; Podcast :
it is not a complete copy of a proxy address or a mirror .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one is access@@ ing another URL , which is not the original . that what you can see is from Wikipedia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically , the server runs the request to the correct Wikipedia page , so that it is possible to see contents from Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this is done by a server , which is not in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he looked around around , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with po@@ or@@ ly positioned moti@@ fs and washed colours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that motiv@@ ates him to carry a camera with himself and try to en@@ grave the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
back then he was a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar , Sag@@ ar , tries to bring about the international stage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and his hometown directly beside the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , it offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot some photos that attention to Nep@@ as animal world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he described on Facebook as she helps him this first @-@ class situation in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park ; a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I rested just at home when suddenly the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan Ga@@ ida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father , that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti River , a le@@ op@@ ard would be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the Leopard , and I immediately began to kne@@ el pictures ! ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sag@@ ar is aim@@ ing to gain a collaboration with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nepal , and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as terri@@ fying as they look . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he should know it , for he was already faced by the face of the face , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a tiger may not distur@@ b itself from the opinion of the sheep anymore ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even I was on the way home after the darkness and suddenly the king of the book appeared . he immediately went , and let us see and take me through the trees of the trees ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to promote protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ as and wild animals is not always easy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he waited for 22 days , and lived mostly in a tent to take pictures of the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings by Ot@@ ter . up to 12 days it took to take pictures and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , which live near the tourist arri@@ vals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a , originally published on video Volun@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organization from India . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a revised version was once again published as part of a content @-@ sharing convention .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in many parts of India , women avoid greatest care , names of their hus@@ bands , or even older men in the family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead it uses a pron@@ o@@ ose or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h to respect the husband &apos;s social pressure , as well as fear of consequences , they should have received the norm on life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convicted of an Indian state O@@ dish@@ a by an Indian Court , and moved by her family and the village community after she had asked a married family with names . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tradition has also not known their wives on behalf , is also known among men . however , they have much less access to fear if at all , they should not follow this practice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the small village of Wal@@ der in the district of P@@ une , in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health professionals and home women , were thus quickly becoming the main theme of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a place only for them alone , where they can discuss and discuss the fin@@ ths of the patri@@ archy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as one of 56 clubs which there is in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community Video Volun@@ te@@ ers and is devoted to the breakdown of the patri@@ archy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was working for seven years with the help of their video camera on the cover of practices such as children &apos;s hei@@ ress to the exile of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and heads this club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they report about how these clubs have created a safe place for these women , and at the same time they have made to amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors of the wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini exhibited in their discussion round , did not appeal to women who do not call their hus@@ bands on behalf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she chose this subject , because they wanted to open the interview about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which the women can easily identify with . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to their hus@@ bands , it is a Br@@ other that they charged all duties and never ques@@ tioned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini writes :
this tradition witnessed that a woman respected her husband and wishes him a long life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman who doesn &apos;t hold it , is regarded as a c@@ unning , as a woman without mor@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this discussion lap .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the start of the Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband so far , had to try out at home as it runs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother in law .
Roh@@ ini told :
my mother in law and my husband were silent after the video was finished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband turned to me and said , I should name him from now on his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini launched her first discussion club with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family were protected mainly girls and women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the video projection , the women tried to bring the discussion with an exercise in motion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini asked each participant in to tell the name of her husband with various feelings - happy , anno@@ yed , sad , loving and so on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked them all , &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us what they do , does that not respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day in whom she brought the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ i in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra on the breaking of a century tradition , in which women have never allowed the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini told :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman was so shy , that during the whole exercise it was only afraid of himself , another decided to release the entire grac@@ eful fru@@ stration against him and his family by hiding him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the expression on their faces were ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still in ad@@ renal@@ ine f@@ ren@@ zy , with an ancient Br@@ other , the women decided that they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands on behalf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they kept their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a multitude of reports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in his head , his wife could not stop his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another club member decided to do it before dinner before the whole family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when her mother in law she was stub@@ born , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation art@@ ete in violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini reports , how women tried to stop other practices , such as carrying the chin @-@ red dot on the forehead , which shows the marriage : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why only women show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband , that I would carry the zinc red dot if he would do it as well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he laughed just , and I finished talking to wear it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the other women have not stopped working with it , but they think they are now in a better position to choose it in some days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we do a trip with every discussion club .
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to make sure the women take care of what could hear , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past few months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; she danced , and talked about things about which they had never had thought before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I also have some things , for example like our identity as our hus@@ bands have never said so hon@@ estly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels great to say certain things loud , no matter how small it can occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some women in the group have carried only Sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for most is that okay , but some wanted to carry a Sal@@ man @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt about an pants , and they did not match . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a lot of dispute and discussion on the advantages of their own clothes , mor@@ als connected with the sar@@ is and much more , ding@@ g@@ ent Roh@@ ini their own couple Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a discussion round so that women could wear them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can carry Je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure that they will be able to create it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the question , whether in the five months since their first discussion club has changed slightly , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things slowly come into roles : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have only made small steps so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some women rehear@@ sed it a few times , but then they listened to her husband &apos;s name again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some , including me , make it still , but only if they are alone and no other family members are there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red at their fore@@ heads . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women in the discussion club know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives , like the ra@@ ctions for freedom of movement or their own coat of clothes - at the end of a hard to navigate river . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each one of us is a sacrifice of patri@@ archy .
I am it too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this club , however , gives us confidence that will change something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families , if every woman goes home to the club and other people know about what we are talking about and what we do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all sit in the same boat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the correspon@@ dents of the video Volun@@ te@@ ers Community are coming from formed groups in India and make videos about stories , about which is not reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these stories are &quot; news of those who experience it itself , &quot; and provide a hyper@@ local context to report about global human rights and development claims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a commem@@ oration day

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 29 June this year the has@@ h@@ tag was the opening of the Japanese Twitter trend , with which many fans shared memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as an in@@ sol@@ sti@@ ce in the Japanese culture of post @-@ war era .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , visited the Beat@@ les 1964 in London in 2016 at the 50th anniversary of the first visit : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for just under five days , the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this has passed enough to rot@@ ate the Japanese . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; human beings have become quite clear , that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new system of kidn@@ apping people for organ@@ ics , probably for the believers of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government called for a number of operations to life to stop the practition@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ k , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the victims has been be@@ headed and a part of the organs were taken out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two men were arrested , and in a consequence they stood by the bodies of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a smooth man could bring gold , the police pre@@ press by z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time that the subsequent attacks on smooth men were registered in Mozambique .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another group , the aim of assassination for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this led to the UN in South African land carried out a mission to investigate this practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is custom@@ ary in other countries of southern Africa , particularly in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tion and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ k , where the murdered people were arrested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hus@@ hai Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , a student and residents of the city of In@@ ham@@ bane in the south of Mozambique said that the local police have already left the case : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
PR@@ M believes that sham@@ ans are involved in the death of men &apos;s men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the persecution and murder of gl@@ ac@@ ulate individuals for the profit and sale of their organs in Mor@@ per@@ bal@@ a , for presumably believing ritu@@ als , has caused the police to exist in the power of Mozambique , according to whom the victims have existed in the head of power . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days , three men with hair fall problems were murdered in this part of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Sam@@ an@@ tha distributed the chron@@ icle of the B@@ log@@ gers poor S@@ na@@ i@@ ppa , which indicates that the problem is part of the larger social difficulties faced with Mozambique : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to be ashamed of GER@@ NE E@@ IN Mos@@ ambi@@ k , in which the people would like to be ashamed of making sex against good notes , and they would not harm your bread , in which the people would like to hunt a country or become black magic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bas@@ sel &apos;s stay and Constitution were unknown until today ( 01 . August 2017 ) , when N@@ our@@ a from Syrian officers knew that he was executed in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

a photo of Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Liu X@@ ia that was probably made recently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the case of imprisoned Chinese dis@@ si@@ dents of Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o had drawn attention to international community attention , after his lawyer had been handed over to the hospital at the end of June . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2009 Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison because of &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state end@@ anger ) after having responded to the draft of the democratic reforms in China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China , Li@@ us case referred to as &quot; an internal matter . &quot; he said it as &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless China continues to call calls from the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , Di@@ visions in Liu X@@ ia , to permit him a treatment abroad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the str@@ ingent treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely exhausted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ized some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Liu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a speaker declined to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to make Liu abroad a treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Norway
Norway &apos;s Minister @-@ President Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Bren@@ de refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the relationship between China and Norway were put to Liu after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu , although the Norwegian government had nothing to do with the decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diplomatic relations were again continued in December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement for the salmon crew to China , since the exports were largely blocked since 2010 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the news spread , Liu was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee brought his hope to an unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of his imprisonment he was not able to accept his price .
during the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision where China was urged to liber@@ ate Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support , where he wants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chief diplom@@ acy of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us , as she said in a statement on June 30 , 2011 : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , we expect China to raise all limitations of Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife and family members . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should meet and receive all visits , which they wish , and be able to communicate with the outside world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
United States
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told him that he has the opportunity for the treatment abroad , so that he could help him with his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker at the US Embassy in China , Mary Bet@@ h Pol@@ ley , announced the message of the Chinese authorities to release the Chinese authorities , but also his wife Liu X@@ ia from her house arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call of the US embassy was an angry response from China according to the Foreign Ministry that &quot; no country has the right to un@@ reasonable and ir@@ responsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley told that China should offer the following couple following :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protection and freedom , e.g. travel incen@@ tives and access to medical care of its choice , which they claim according to Chinese constitution and legal system and international obligations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision to push for the Chinese government to push Liu and his wife unconditional . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Germany in Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German Government of Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hoping that Liu &apos;s all the medical support he needed , and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i Jin@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing of the news agency Reuters that China had great concerns , whether the host of Liu could sur@@ pass the visit to Hamburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada - Canada
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John McC@@ all@@ um called China to provide them with appropriate medical care and provide him with the opportunity to worry about his family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ us lawyer told AF@@ P earlier that Li@@ us &apos;s wife , Liu X@@ ia could visit him every day , but the police are always supervised the room in the hospital and that it is not permitted to contact someone outside , including his lawyers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
McC@@ all@@ um continues to tell :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada demands China on its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , to preserve and release the exercise of these rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
France in France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry requested China to release Liu out of humanitarian reasons :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments that he , regardless of where , requires his wife and his family contact him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country , there was no further information to find out if France will eventually receive it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
vac@@ ations in Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the Festival in Taiwan demanded China on June 27 , on Liu &apos;s liberation and a greater tolerance to those who use peaceful resources to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legis@@ lator Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu of the ruling Democratic Pro@@ gress Party , also called on China to allow the sick of intellectual Liu , to be treated in Taiwan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dalai Lama
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed in a statement on June 28th at Liu was very worried and gave many of him asked to pray for Li@@ us Well being . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said about Liu :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is my belief that the initiatives that he took , and for whom he had been strictly punished to have contributed to a harmonious , stable and aff@@ lu@@ ent China , which in turn had contributed to a peaceful world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt personally moved and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or a country ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question might seem stupid , since Singapore is recognized as an international level as an independent state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but according to the Justice Minister K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam you should consider Singapore as a city .
this re@@ mark has triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Association of New York , the Minister realized that many people compared the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore , because they are compared to Singapore with other countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it supports Singapore to consider Singapore as a city .
... no one has asked whether New York is a democracy ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is , with most people go to an error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tried to explain that we are otherwise .
we are a city .
we are no country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Justice Minister , &quot; to spin the logic to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then , after all our efforts and offerings to create this valuable country , we hear that we &apos;re not a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it sounded so vul@@ gar and it had the appearance of a flight from responsibilities earlier .
Singapore - if you are not my country and whose land is it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grounds were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal countries &quot; because of his , he appeared inevitably un@@ democratic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , alike , which are permanently run by a party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these cities are democra@@ tically .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as you reach the main focus of the topic , the good old ly@@ re of the author@@ itarian rulers will be able to leave the dist@@ ressed logic , because it fits better to their power . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final effect , the answers to his American guests were given answers to his American guests in terms of our press , our judicial system , our political system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
corresponding question tar@@ ts he tar@@ ded with non @-@ answers .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ sty to illustrate his opinion because she didn &apos;t understand this conclusion .
personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to what country is our city ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly I don &apos;t understand anything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be very thank@@ ful if our alert K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam was trying to clari@@ fy this point , if it was paid high in order to be part of the government of Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by publishing on the blog , he points out to read the reviews of the conference that one should begin to better understand the context of the say@@ ings of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ sty , according to which Singapore was a city and no country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
read the script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was more of a &quot; city &quot; as a country , &quot; he declared why the elections in Singapore were so un@@ equal , even if we are excited to clean up the free and just election . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ob@@ sol@@ ete Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party a party ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was not a country , he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment over Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , the leader of a growing generation that makes such pol@@ em@@ ical statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am over what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , what would expect me - whether I agree with them or not , but that is another thing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ sty , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not sure if he really believes it , right and aware of what he defended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Singapore is not a country , we are only regarded as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if not in which country go back to the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique and it is equally the country and city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since he plays an important role within the government Cab@@ inet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ sty are of severe importance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do the people of Singapur make their military service , do they defend their city but not their country ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who must pay our Prime Minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink personnel ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade for the affir@@ ma@@ tions , Singapore is and always was a city : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this sentence seems to have been angry many of the people of Singapur ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; the defense of the country , especially &quot; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defence of the city .

Global Vo@@ ices wonder@@ ed his editors : what is the most ab@@ used aspect at your residence or homeland ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your answers will be published here as a part of an ongoing series , with rum@@ ours about certain parts of the world uncovered and another fac@@ et is to be shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest part of this series is Nev@@ in Thompson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question , which is most asked for me in Japan , is : &quot; are you an American ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I am sorry . &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; I live from Canada . &quot; I live in Japan since 1994 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on what situation is happening , it is considered to be polite , interest in his conversation partners showing personal questions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my clari@@ fication , then mostly follows the default response : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; many can@@ adi@@ ers probably cook against anger , but it does not distur@@ b me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for someone who does not know , there is little that can@@ adi@@ ers differ from American . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is one of the reasons why so many can@@ adi@@ ers have a Canadian flag visible to their ru@@ cksack , when they are travelling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all love can@@ adi@@ ers .
American however ... .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it was , when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and September 11 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can@@ adi@@ ers have always worn small map@@ le leaves at their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
there is no weapons with us !
gender equality has been legal since 2005 in Canada !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are polite .
we obviously say very often &quot; exc@@ use . &quot;
Canada is also considered to be the most tolerant country of ethnic groups .
we are not as those types south of the border .
we can@@ adi@@ ers are nice .
I hate this .
first I have many American friends I admi@@ red a lot .
it would be nothing to me if you would like to change Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; firstly : as &apos; nice &apos; to be called , is basically to be sp@@ ill , but trag@@ ically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has one &apos;s own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Canada really would be a nation of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no edges and corners , nothing at which one can encounter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
harmless to be harmless and in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous and no attention to earn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be something good if you want to be un@@ noticed in the background , far away from things that happen around one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would even go so far , say that the desire to be free and alone , is a major role of Canadian Canadian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we tend to take care of our own business .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what recei@@ vable as &quot; nice , &quot; is perhaps simply dar@@ ing courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can@@ adi@@ er often talk about the fence across the fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we lack the warm , open kindness that I meanwhile connect with my American friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , Justin Tru@@ de@@ au visited the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than only &quot; nice . &quot; our Prime Minister made Canada almost sexy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
music video of a pop band par@@ odi@@ sets Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one in Thailand &apos;s famous pop band has released a music video which took over the Jun@@ ta and re@@ produce its power in 2014 , despite its promises to revi@@ ve the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who told him what rules he makes his girlfriend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although not explicitly politically , the music video refers to the prev@@ ailing military rule of the jun@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the band has been praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage , to describe the country &apos;s situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the video of the song was a huge success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the first three days , the video loaded on Facebook was divided up to 1,@@ 254 times and received 8.@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand , after a group of activists blocked the public to watch this video . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is possible to interpret the video as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai policies , as it is with the position of the country under the jun@@ ta rule . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take a look at these recordings of the video , which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has been pursued in the past three years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; may possibly refer to the most dra@@ vo@@ c section 44 of the provisional Constitution , which makes the commander @-@ free decision making matters most important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th general rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are considered critics of the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crimin@@ ality , whose vag@@ ue and un@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities to conf@@ use activists and other critics of the State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this purpose , a new unit in the army was also set up , supervised the online content and the people who were accused of having de@@ fam@@ ed the monarchy is pro@@ secuted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thailand occupies a strict sense of &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ esty device ) .
on 20 May 2014 the laws of war was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to buy is their decision to buy U @-@ boats , even though security experts were waiting that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax collectors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the video , even how people will be thrown into a black delivery van , before you can bring them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists sit in prison , because they allegedly caused the &quot; confusion &quot; in society and are charged with Internet users , to ins@@ ult the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile the te@@ aser of the songs of the band , which was bred the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The tribute of Pan@@ em , &quot; had already been used by coup opponents during protests in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ no@@ v , was first published on the OC Media website and published here with friendly permission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post@@ war company only re@@ covers very slowly in Eastern Asia Min@@ or , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ian war officially ended , but his s@@ cars are still visible in this part of the republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern districts in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show distinctive images .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the water basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , amor@@ alism , Geor@@ gian and Armen@@ ians lived and collabor@@ ated to Soviet times in the area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today they live to the largest part Russians and ab@@ domin@@ ates in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Asia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the pre @-@ war period , more than 10.000 people survived , today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic of spher@@ ical .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2011 , the total population of the districts was 16.@@ 000 people after having barely increased over a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 1989 about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district .

&quot; this is a sequence of war &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the empty five @-@ storey living blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , which are called the K@@ hr@@ at@@ ch@@ kov@@ kas , are symbo@@ lically for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the buildings are falling down and rarely , they are inhabited by more than two families . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elderly man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a conversation , and it is difficult to finish this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a sequence of war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; why don &apos;t I talk to you ?
it is nevertheless unique . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were municipal centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens who served all of the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded glory buildings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who once lived in this place and settled their contribution towards the central planning sector of the Soviet Union , have now left the district . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha about fifty inhabitants live .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ hr@@ us@@ h@@ che@@ v , which is still one or two families , can be seen on the balconies , where laundry is dried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two young girls . both seven years old and look out of the window of a destroyed house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they discover me with the camera in your hand , they immediately go back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; our mothers forbi@@ d us that we let us take pictures , &quot; says one of the girls .
&quot; why ? &quot; it is forbidden to us that is all . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the girl whis@@ pers on her friend something and suddenly they leave the destroyed buildings and disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ u@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for the self @-@ consumption ) such as animal hus@@ band@@ ry , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation .
it &apos;s difficult to come across the rounds .
the District Administration takes place in winter for free candles and bread on the villages .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will cultiv@@ ate cour@@ g@@ ettes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about ten years ago , an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ eth , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Gen@@ ov@@ tu@@ k@@ ha . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite her el@@ dest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left before Ab@@ cha@@ sia to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will remain in Asia Min@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to accept financial assistance from her daughter and insist@@ ed that she instead supported her young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly r@@ ents are just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a@@ unt G@@ eth tells her and other villa@@ gers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
when holidays are we visit us .
but we cannot do that - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
while she tells her story her younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha , calling T@@ unt G@@ eth her . &quot; they said , we could build cour@@ g@@ ettes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will cultiv@@ ate cour@@ g@@ ettes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ aly@@ as conver@@ sa@@ tion@@ alist Nat@@ ascha together has lived together with her husband and the five common children in their home for some time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she remin@@ is@@ cent of the war in front of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the relatives that live in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country Ab@@ cha@@ sia broke away ) , they did not leave the opportunity to leave . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; we recently bought the country in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative town in Ab@@ b@@ asia ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will last some time , &quot; explains them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives about $ 9 children for each child .
her husband is working in the coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; near the house where Nat@@ ascha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once found , they keep pigs , cows , t@@ aps and chickens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells us that it was a very fri@@ ghtening situation , when many people left the village after the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but over time she lost her anxiety .

&quot; we don &apos;t be afraid of the dark street or few people .
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that this building were destroyed during the war .
but it actually has something to do with lo@@ ot@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the war , there was hardly any work and all lived like it was right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I remember it every day , as the city and the war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as our conversation ends up to the end , a little boy runs over us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it runs through the window of a destro@@ ying building and hi@@ des .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ased him .
he plays with the ball which then rolls down the hill .
a group of children now tracks the ball .
while they run , some of them throw stones on the falling building .
these ruins are part of their childhood that provide integrity in their lives .
you don &apos;t know it differently .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula and is located at the border of Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is directed by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican , a small woman with a coral pink spectacle and golden shades of t@@ eddy bear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez , and grew up in Tap@@ ach@@ ula . nevertheless they know many under the name of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this nick@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it has become a goal for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tian , who are on transit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for about 2,@@ 50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms , with bare ass , fl@@ aming walls and beds made of metal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - but hundreds African and Hai@@ tian migrants are coming here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez , coming the people into full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast , they start to call : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at present , it is rather quiet but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez welcomed already 200 guests simultaneously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are only 24 rooms and some have already slept on cardboard boxes .
she wants to refuse any one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she also helps them and bring them to the hospital if they are sick , she buys their medicines that they cannot pay , they mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ m away from the long journey exhausted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao from Angola originally arrived at a short time ago .
I asked him whether Mama Africa is a reasonable nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebas@@ ti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a Mu@@ gh@@ ur@@ ger ) is posing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; he respon@@ ds with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it fits to her that African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels to Boston with his sister , who hopes to come to Boston to find her husband and the three children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans which are on the way to the United States to take the first stop in South America and then direction north . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard from other pione@@ ers of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a famous name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells that the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel together the route , and that Afri@@ cans already speak to W@@ hat@@ s@@ App by Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like many of his companion , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as building workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the football world championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the Brazilian economy has been weaker , he started his journey into the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has been a guest at Mama Africa since months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money , to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I ask him if he will get in touch with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; he respon@@ ds smiling . &quot; we will always be in touch with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells that her guests often send word messages when they went , to greet them or to report about the course of their journey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it declar@@ es that their Christian faith is the drive of their work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have taught her to prepare chicken like in Ghana . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well @-@ known , but it &apos;s not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ ela .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this winter , Valencia and his family have recorded migrants in their little house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to be sold to numerous African immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has begun to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar spent the night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the moment 25 people are there mainly in Hai@@ tian .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some sleep on blan@@ kets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Valen@@ cian ela explains that he knows what the guests do through .
&quot; I have lived in the United States . &quot; I have experienced what they experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I crossed the border to the desert , and we suffered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people help and others do not help , this is the reason why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after having lived for three years , he became a raid on his work place from the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he had fled to Honduras with his wife and three children , who wanted to press money from him , without having a plan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he has asked for accommodation and an unknown , one single one , has offered her roof . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few months later , the family still lives there and tried to decide where the next step is to go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the courses the travelers feel calm their phones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , much from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems to be happy that her house is full , but it &apos;s also nostal@@ gic , because of those who went away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like a proud grand@@ mother she leaf@@ lets her album with numerous photos .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair spots that she has made a client@@ ele , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and elderly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she laughs sad while she briefly presented her .
&quot; Ya You fu@@ er@@ on &quot; is repe@@ ating it every time . &quot; they are gone now . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a mobile app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communications equipment in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter users to commence in general .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in the west of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on her mobile phones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 10 July , the mobile users in Tian@@ an@@ an district of the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile notification ; in which it points to install the Government Government called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the message , it is said that the app will allow &quot; to access terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the authorities could use the App for more than fight against terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture , because they were installed shortly after they had replaced the app with a private We@@ Chat group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the message of the police , the app will determine the sources and the deployment of terrorists , together with &quot; illegal religious activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ books and documents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang@@ s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a security system with system categories for children and adults - introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elecom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main function is the block por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users attention to it online and to control your own home network remot@@ ely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this app with the filters for min@@ ors should help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; or even h@@ acker could be able to manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or steal it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while messages over digital c@@ ens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the East and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in distant ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in the conflict areas the authorities often arrange extreme cen@@ sored and monitoring measures as well as a rout@@ in@@ ely Internet depreci@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on Twitter based media Out@@ let &quot; Images from a Check@@ point , &quot; the cen@@ sored news published in China , showed photographs from a Check@@ point , on the polic@@ emen susp@@ end the surveillance App installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian are sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ v@@ ang App .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mobile notification demanded that people are installing the app within 10 days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you dis@@ connect to a Check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they comp@@ elled to use people , who are intended for older people , to use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a form of captivity by the transition technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Images from the China &quot; ( opening up to the sake ) also released a J@@ ing@@ i@@ ang product description , that the software can lift up the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard disk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computers and cell@@ phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang are connected to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city party council , minimize the dissemin@@ ation of illegal content . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all government branches , authorities and related institutions , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office in operation of their computer and communication devices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a current report by Freedom House , a US @-@ American Human Rights organization also mentioned this new monitoring methods :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , with the order to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; by the local police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the intention is obviously any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; to identify and destroy the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants , and gives it pen@@ alties for a whole range of other possible awards , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sleep or death - Part 1 : all cri@@ es to death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo of : Cor@@ rie Bar@@ kli@@ more ( CC BY 2.0 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in a series of sleep or death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane is described in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far away from our blue , virtual world , you look at and stell@@ ar firmly that you &apos;re all alone in one place where everything is wi@@ ped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has turned after and after dissolved and a truth reveals that clearly identi@@ fiable , both inside and outside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one who makes all honor their name .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one who has kno@@ cked in a list of feelings and expressions , which do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when looking out the reality behind the scenes - beyond the drama , the beautiful scenes and the performer - turn the characters into being of flesh and blood , and everything is crying after death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all doubts dissolve in smoke and you &apos;ll be aware of your existence , even if the earth is tra@@ pped on the axis of the Un@@ h@@ d . your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , are built around stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but I didn &apos;t think so that I had formulated my lesson as the chief of the security services - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he gave his power over us , giving even the simpl@@ est concepts that we knew . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
five you@@ ths were torn during a peaceful protests like dar@@ nel from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough , so that the city moves the darkness of the night with &quot; Al@@ la@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ aming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but all the districts sought not only my own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time it was quiet , rainy time , even though I had no high demands on a town that has been t@@ opped up to arter@@ ies with governmental security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the third night the things had cal@@ med down , after having heard the power supply in the neighborhood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I broke the silence by shou@@ ting several times &quot; Al@@ la@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice by silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to get together .
I was not alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we joined us to a glorious picture that filled my expectations full and full . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in such a moment , you are aware that you are liberated the spirit from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t care in the barley . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; makes you ready , we meet our military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can go down - nothing can give you back your voice , after you have shot it all the way up to the ministry of safety from the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I came there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ent stood there with several of his men , my father was already there , as I now also . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ent starts to speak : &quot; let me hear , as you cry out &apos; al@@ la@@ hu &apos; , or you will only be brave enough to sh@@ out if we are not nearby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes were built on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you must look at what to look for me in the eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did so has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe it was on my fol@@ ly , vanity ; perhaps at the revolution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure , when I said , &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I never ceased to see you in my eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word from what I said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; putting him in individual and his father , with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his father immediately with them . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed thing lies me up to this day in the nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; syndrome &quot; , a mental torture which I was exposed for months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cry out the farm .
in the first office I leave everything back to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then again by the farm and into the second office , which leads through a walk to the individual cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I appreciate all details exactly before I manage the room .
otherwise they gave me a bigger cell to me this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share it with only one single prisoner , and let me bet immediately without waiting for their permission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after some minutes , felt like a whole life , the officers left the cell and I went back to an old and proven communication method : with the fist against the wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that my cell was a &quot; black@@ s@@ ling . &quot;
after a long hes@@ it@@ ating he rep@@ lied to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apparently , none of the surrounding cells was a well @-@ respected man of middle age who sees me similar and called &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in perfect darkness , there are no striking facial features and doctors are not here ; we are all only numbers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; maybe someone who sounds like mine own voice ? &quot;
all answers include one of its existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the major cells .
perhaps he will stop immediately .
the investig@@ ator had insured me and they would che@@ er him if I stay .
a liar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to have had a bird scar@@ ce in order to drive all these cranes , which are in the fruits of my head &apos;s garden . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the distance I still hear them &quot; Al@@ la@@ hu Ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be at approximately 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always fri@@ ght the scre@@ ams every day .
the door opens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was always convinced that black is the color of the corruption , until I saw the yellow light , which gave us the horror into person : the ra@@ ad ( e.g. : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; playing the 13th S@@ ure of Kor@@ an ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they are here to be heard . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus the secret was lifted up : to protect the state security in front of us and to prevent the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they talk in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - so they played their con@@ fession@@ al map and betra@@ yed the close vision of their world view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a house , which is no country here ; it is a curse to give them co@@ existence in order to transform their c@@ lans into a hero . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I manage the audi@@ tory and meet in Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and potent man ; at least he comes to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the triumph@@ al expressions that are un@@ seas@@ oned : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start doing this day and protest on demonstrations that will soon find an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I have acc@@ ustom@@ ed to it to answer it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much more precisely , when ins@@ ults and blows on a friendly conversation for me to an ordinary communication agent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when and how it happened was un@@ important .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some voice in me said that I had to get used to it or have to get used to it , although I did nothing to earn these punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in all its diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he calls the loving &quot; con@@ fes@@ sion . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the clo@@ ver .
your h@@ ank@@ ers treat your cri@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure with him , and you can &apos;t keep your cri@@ es back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my cry did not fail to him yet , which means that they exchanged the tube through a cable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my first arrest , I asked whether the investig@@ ator had worked as a garbage collector , or whether it belonged to normal working equipment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they had four cables inter@@ woven together to present us , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within one hour , three of them change , while I was still in the row . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had lost any feeling in my body - and my voice , which is why I listened to scre@@ aming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the h@@ ank@@ ers noticed the cooling and had no pleasure in it , which is why it is the next to an electrically charged rod . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
electricity passed my whole body to supply enough to feed my whole neighborhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my half @-@ naked body , the stretched out on the ground , was the perfect conductor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that must have been around midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I decided to sleep again , let &apos;s say that was my only option . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some hours were leaving which came to me like minutes .
then the call for the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens , and the morning light meets the space &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I reply with the voice of an exhau@@ sting young people , &quot; My lord , my father must make terrible wor@@ ries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be quiet and walk away you will be laid . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper Em@@ let@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Em@@ let@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b brings much of his time inside ; sometimes he s@@ acked from his canvas , time to his computer , and again also to his couch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what you can rely on , is a cigarette between his fingers or his nic@@ ot@@ ine lips to discover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he lives in the top floor of his family house which had belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel had forced his occupation of the West Bank to flee from their village in Palestine in whom she had lived as fel@@ ah@@ y@@ een ( about : farmers ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passion@@ ately active activ@@ ist who challenged the conservative majority of mutual opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and free expression of expression through art and rape . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his music , often deals with issues such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of the whole Arab world . all these topics do not only demand the core of the entire Arab world . but also in towns , which are rich in Syria through to San@@ aa in Yemen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees itself as someone who has not been confin@@ ed through boundaries with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even if he doesn &apos;t give it open to the US foreign policy a special ab@@ norm@@ ality .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who attempt to do in war zones , thus signi@@ fies himself , even if he was born in Jordan , and has never been in Palestine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think of my own living conditions so &quot; empha@@ sizes H@@ da@@ i@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; I think that I am a man , while he dissolved in water . it is the holy month Ram@@ ad@@ an ; it is the holy month Ram@@ ad@@ an ; in that time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ ad@@ an is illegal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has to break a certain weakness with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a sen@@ ti@@ ously hot Jun@@ it@@ ag did little to do with protest against Islam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically we are talking a warm , warm coffee and the wa@@ vy of the K@@ ent cigarette into the nose primarily of freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially when one has a look into the neighbouring countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it simply avo@@ ids basic things to do - as in the public during Ram@@ ad@@ an water - not to land in jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled a gig of the band Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , already for the second time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some par@@ liament@@ arians , which support the Muslim action front - might argue the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood , refle@@ cting the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country , and the main reason for the concert . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MPs and former press spokesperson on the Islamic Coalition D@@ IMA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CNN , that the concert was cancelled due to sexual orientation of the singer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many also claim that the engagement of the band in affairs , such as the Arab Spring , human rights and free expression in the Arab world , is dangerous legi@@ timacy of the entire region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a public statement of Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which continue to be decided &quot; for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this statement might probably not be simply sil@@ ky rh@@ et@@ oric , but in fact reflected more clearly @-@ cryst@@ alli@@ zed reality in Jordan which clearly occurs in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s traditional gender nor@@ ms gave to body by having his vision of the fate of Arabic women who have vo@@ iced sex . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently set unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of them that they should trust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Jordan , the number of &apos;@@ Hon@@ mor@@ de &apos; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to human Rights Watch the number of honor mor@@ nings reached its peak in 2016 , however , Jordan was still scar@@ ce to support women who attempted murder or domestic violence in reasonable way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a law on breaking control in 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence , &quot; and for their release is often necessary for years of bureaucra@@ tic expenditure and the guarantee provided by the family that the woman will not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs Music enjoys great popularity and is well known for this , even in his country long as tab@@ u g@@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is politically , however , recognizes his music that is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
I was stun@@ ned by politics . &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a song called &quot; Edward Sa , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are politically involved in the core .
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse often repe@@ ats itself :
&quot; you are free and everyone else is it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market in which one can , in his words , &quot; that can , &quot; it is faith or non @-@ faith , H@@ et@@ ero@@ sion or homosexu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he noticed that hardly anybody in Jordan spoke about the rights of homosexu@@ als and les@@ bians , and that comments on the equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were strongly cen@@ sored until 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b introduced an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an Onlin@@ e@@ Program Ro@@ ya to later to mem@@ ori@@ ze his comments from the context and had been cen@@ sored by his opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts , but stre@@ amed only a mach@@ ined version , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b adverti@@ ses the Arabic LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that int@@ oler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als don &apos;t speak to Islam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ eva , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains with his homo@@ erotic poetry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b ques@@ tioned : if Abu Nu@@ ern@@ ers , who could work later on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write in eighth century openly about homosexu@@ ality , why is Jord@@ an@@ ians not able ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , did nothing with Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the warmer UK , nothing new is that the government attacks against freedom of expression and that progressive voices will be applied to silence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian News Service took several former government officials and members of the teachers who would have cri@@ tici@@ zed the problems related to the issues related to corruption in the land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; given that , the concert of H@@ da@@ i@@ bs view is only the tip of the ice@@ berg - the real challenge is to effect a structural change in the next generation of Jord@@ an@@ ians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for him progress has gone a constant giving and taking a gig on the second time in a row , but the path of progress - this is what H@@ da@@ i@@ b consists of slow , remembered and internal changes . he is sure that these changes are held from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , also dreamed of a Arab world without interventions abroad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he does not only dream of his work until Bagh@@ dad , to bring Jerusalem and Damascus , but to experience it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the region will pursue the region using music , art and literature of genuine and basic op@@ enness - and not through bombs , stre@@ um@@ uni@@ tions and on artificial manner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far as far as it is done , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to get resist@@ ed and thus resist .
this report was made by the Pul@@ itzer Centre on Crisis Reporting to which A@@ man listened to as a student Fel@@ low .
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
these big and extravag@@ ant war@@ ri@@ ors are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories about the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is alleged that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival which is usually taken over in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ kus and come out of some time , in the troops of Japan , to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can only imagine how large these parts are ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a joint center in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a long time again to see the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en : two stro@@ ll@@ s have just come to see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival will spend the only True - and a breathtaking way to spend his summer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the North of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of an 18 metre @-@ high fortress was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rarely were outer appar@@ ition and body care as important as in this story , because they are helping to keep Peruvian youth from crime and promote a legitimate job as the hair@@ dresser &apos;s home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Cal@@ la@@ o , Per@@ us &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where road ro@@ b and illegal drugs are daily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other medium and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trend , the appearance and therefore also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Brazil ) , has led to a more normal citizen into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers that can make these elaborate dres@@ sers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the un@@ preced@@ ented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event to take place of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os &quot; competition since 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are experts in each other to show , who can create the ex@@ cent@@ ric L@@ ooks as you can see in the following video ( further videos to current cont@@ ests are available on public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy that has found herself in El Cal@@ la@@ o and found here an opportunity to share their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of bad advice to get a training in hair@@ dresser &apos;s art .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; motivated by this activity and the possibilities , dozens of young people saw that they can take a profession which is currently in fashion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the school year , the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of their successes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 1995 , we were the only technical school in the municipality and the district which we are very proud because of love for the children we have built this educational community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters

use with friendly permission .
the following article is the revised edition of the &quot; love messages to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters who has published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why are we just writing love letters to people we know ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; isn &apos;t it much more import@@ antly , people who are ej@@ ected to bring affection ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
exactly this question came to the two young Colum@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ á@@ r@@ ra@@ ga from the Young Youth Foundation and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os ( letters to reconciliation ) campaign and inspired young people to write gu@@ err@@ illa fighters letters .
only recently her country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to help her part : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government concluded a peace treaty with the gu@@ err@@ illa movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces ) in Latin America .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; International became the signat@@ ory of the Peace Treaty , so significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for its mer@@ its . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in front of Columbus , however , there is a long way until one can speak of a true reconciliation and peace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ err@@ illa fighters who had lived in illegal camps for many years and carried out their arms around the clock , have to integrate himself into life as civilians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Colom@@ bian society , in turn , had become acc@@ ustom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases , they have to record their ranks and support them in creating a new life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young colum@@ bi@@ ans had joined together and had to help integrate the integration process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s exactly what they did : up to now , thousands of young people wrote letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them back to society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , who will then be handed over personally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters of reconciliation was born on the World Summit of Peace Prize in February 2017 . there was Leonardo and Cris@@ tian the possibility to speak with Kail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i in February 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this declared that we love the people who love to write thousands of love letters on Valentine &apos;s Day , but those who need them much more needed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this year he plan , he told us to share his love with people who needed most of the most urgent benefits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the plan arose , letters full of hope and support for former war@@ rior of the F@@ ARC who will now find their place in society and have a new life to make the dis@@ course of a common history of peace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the framework of the campaign more than 2000 letters were collected .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ I have never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over on March 19 in one of the UN bearings in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a group of 40 students from the University Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ tos traveled into the camp in order to persu@@ ade letters personally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the members of the F@@ ARC were based on how they had done earlier to accept the commands of their leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of sub@@ jection from all over the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it is unbelievable how many different feelings one go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies in between , &quot; said the policy makers Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sandra Par@@ ra ; a collabor@@ ator of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience such :
after we had handed over the letters I led me a former fighter by the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ book &quot; ( a kind of cabin , where the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters live ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighters who wrote something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid to go down , because next to him there was a M@@ GL pom@@ eg@@ ro@@ wers , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I said to him , &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; he said , &quot; I answer a letter that someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; never before my life has written me something like this , so I answer to it . so suddenly tears flow@@ ed over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I embra@@ ced him completely and put me to the Gar@@ net .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps he was sorry for war , it was sorry to be all the years of faithful companions of this struggle , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life as war . &quot; the F@@ ARC was the only way to safegu@@ ard him and his six brothers before the famine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would never thought that anyone would forgive myself for my fault . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now I know that there is a society out there , waiting for us with open arms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
till now I have learned how to deal with weapons .
but now where peace prev@@ ails I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
to the start students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together to a discussion round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the students were all grown up as already war , and the F@@ ARC had already been in secret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and their views over the peace process . now , where we have the opportunity to contribute to a political party , we can contribute to the society in this country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to overcome this mag@@ nit@@ ude , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those people who have never found himself heard and had no electoral law so far , and they have learned that people often have seen as monsters and have turned their environment very painful for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reality where the country lives and hurt me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it comforts me that all men - including those who killed and so much damage , can contribute to us and give a smile and a hug . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a lot of former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the arch@@ bishop of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the colum@@ bi@@ an@@ ists was white that after the dis@@ armament of peace would reign .
but this is not the case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as it gives ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to lift up and protect their rights . and that is also fully justified ( ... ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are now putting on peace on a policy without weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is why we call all the def@@ en@@ ders of peace , no matter what breed , religion or ide@@ ology they listen - across all those who dream of a land in war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifice , as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . of those who defend the lives as the basis of existence , many difficulties are im@@ min@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our way , there will be many obstacles but together we will overcome them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it follows the translation of an article that was written by our partner A@@ ida Mir@@ mac@@ sum@@ ma , and his first published on the OC Media website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; homosex@@ ual and Que@@ bec living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region , are exposed to a vast range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with fri@@ ght , activists have experienced the coverage of the last months on the persecution of pregnant men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the threat , which depends on the LGB@@ T@@ Q community , is not just over night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who has shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us what is currently happening in the republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has led the head@@ lines several months ago when reports were published , which themati@@ zed the deteri@@ oration , torture and killing of torture in the republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Nov@@ aja Gas@@ eta , and threw a light on the methods of the Ch@@ echn@@ ya officials , susp@@ ect the susp@@ icious men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sabrina , a Trans@@ woman was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when she grew up , her deliber@@ ately became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for them , which is why they moved to Moscow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a group had learned about the genital mu@@ ff@@ ing of their land@@ lady , the hunt for Sabrina was opened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she went out of fear for her life last grand@@ son .
Sabrina : I worked as volunteer in a human rights organization .
one day someone told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an and a Trans@@ woman who were in trouble .
she had no money so I took her without hes@@ itation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while I tried to help her , someone did , of whom I thought he would be a copy of my documents and spread them all over the internet , with my phone number and an image of me . &quot; then there is no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who could eliminate these shame ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
afterwards the photos taken from my documents through the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I was just doing some shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here &apos;s a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a set , but this time on Che@@ chen : &quot; how long will you still honour the family ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only know that there was a young man , no 30 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I lost the awareness and woke last final in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
apparently some women had to hear everything and start scre@@ aming .
the man had fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two j@@ okes in my right lung wings .
OC Media : in which hospitals they were laid - in the men or women ?
Sabrina : my documents are dated but my male name was on it ; but the doctor understood and laid me to the women .
I am very grateful to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I got to do with the fear ; it was a Muslim , a c@@ astic name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am grateful for him , that he has respect@@ ful with me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I spent more than a month in hospital .
last February I got threats .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some perfectly unknown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that all this was a lie . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they put absurd claims . some said to me , I needed to prove that I had never changed my sex in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex , and Photoshop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have gran@@ ny size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to handle this pressure ?
Sabrina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some older people spoke to my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; They have brought up a monster to the world not only your family , but the whole of the republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you , because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my mother became too much , and she put a kn@@ it around his neck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
luck@@ ily the neighbors arrived and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I moved to a flat and a few hours later , a car with dar@@ kened windows and a number plate with 95 points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after it happened for the third time , I realized that something was lazy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my Human rights recru@@ ited recru@@ ited the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you leave ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their name , but I will say that I remember them all , they really helped me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with her help I left the country , but then something unbelievable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly before I left Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I bought it , without registration , without identity , without all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the tr@@ ash .
came and check@@ ered into the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card in my mobile .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother per W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe that you are in security , just because you have left the country ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you already know our people in which hotel you put . you even know your room number .
only to prove it : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
that really was my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , we don &apos;t talk about the gen@@ itals , but this is a t@@ abo@@ o theme . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements do I still wear in me .
so much I wish I can not overcome this mental barrier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we chat with camera , I actually give my effort to look like the person to look out of their past - so to my male form . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know anything about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what are your friends and those who have stayed there ?
Sabrina : I have submitted a report in Washington last week .
for the I needed more information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked with someone who wants to eat one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told that while Ram@@ ad@@ an had no people arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the Ram@@ ad@@ an could barely wait , and he did not lock a new wave . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most likely they will focus on family and relatives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so I mean , they probably invite the relatives to demand the problem with the person concerned and end , and end a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; has experienced by blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : are you even gay men held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sabrina : a friend of me says that there weren &apos;t very many .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if , then above all those who have no rich relatives or those of their relatives were dropped to ask themselves Kad@@ y@@ rows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as I know , they are held there , so that they may present them as terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say : should they be killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim that they would have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if these people had@@ n &apos;t simply disappeared , but supp@@ ressed to radic@@ ally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : is it just a guess or have you a source for this information ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sabrina : I just zi@@ pped someone who was imprisoned in the one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have van@@ ished in this prison after their beard has grown .
there has been nothing new from them since .
they simply took them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even when these men were taken away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , however , they were not introduced as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports so far . we missed that such actions are quite possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why would it not be allowed to shave this man ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you know whether these persecu@@ tions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who have heard a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , &quot; already in the past ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sabrina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think , already before 2003 I was already quite big , when I lived there - and I never had problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
serious in Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sch@@ aria had never had problems .
on the contrary it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally wanted to lead us to the &quot; civil society , &quot; but ultimately dropped us back into the stone age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my eyebrows was we@@ ed ; I had colored lashes , bore tube je@@ ans and short T@@ ops .
the Ministry of Security of Sh@@ aria has never bent me only one hair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people met me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a small place where several ben@@ ches stood , and the whole city knew of it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were never ins@@ ulting .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a speech : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; sp@@ ote not beyond mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
you often say it to children when people make fun of sick .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : so they simply shut up their eyes , because they believed they were sick ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sabrina : yes .
they never ins@@ ul@@ ted me and never sm@@ itten me .
OC Media : how long did this grace period stopped ?
Sabrina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ rov pointed to the plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk about Mor@@ ality in television . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not speak about us , but mainly about the behaviour of women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless - one could feel the people in the city began to change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who sm@@ iles and laughed at once , looked at once with sus@@ pic@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel like the situation in the republic was steadily drow@@ ned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you go after now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the USA not much .
I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
I am currently responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I had a kind of psych@@ ologist with them than a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we perfectly organize te@@ et@@ ffs , meetings , I join them to the hospital and help them to get food cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a long time I do not spend cent .
I have discovered these people myself when I ap@@ per@@ tu@@ te the hiding places .
I am Muslims and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ al@@ ab ?
Sabrina : this is al@@ ber .
so is nature that has nothing to do with religion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ oes , who want to do with foam before the mouth that there are no fl@@ ols with them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Da@@ gest@@ ans who have the cab@@ ard@@ iner , who have the Russians also , who are on the planet ; but they are not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from there , so it &apos;s not unpleasant to hear something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of them - Muslims living in the mosque , and during the Ram@@ ad@@ an fa@@ sten - live together with men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you know many think about Tran@@ si@@ identity of males , the men love , and they believe that you have changed his gender to do more intimate experiences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are two different things - two different kinds of sensation to be precise , different life settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed of my body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not whether I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I &apos;m going to be personally here but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I just don &apos;t know that I am myself .
local groups war@@ n ahead of an increase of self @-@ moral within the ver@@ ished Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian pedi@@ wa@@ z region suff@@ ers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last few months there has been a strong rise of self @-@ moral .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named Jas@@ sem Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27th August , the desper@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community in Iran , which is characterised by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the south @-@ west of Iran .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he suffered under anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness that can pay in@@ ability for his family , such as Ah@@ wa@@ zi Human Rights , who want to work in Ah@@ ra@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a video made on YouTube found the moments when he had lit itself , firmly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people made it fast to er@@ ase the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought into the Tal@@ eg@@ hani hospital in the city of Ah@@ ra@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to local sources , burns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he died a short time later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not the only suicide , which took place in August within the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi minority , and activists protest on the spot so that more men could take their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ah@@ ra@@ zi Centre for Human Rights has announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have this month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their stories have one thing in common : they were all family @-@ pat@@ ern@@ ers who felt during persecution by the Iranian government , hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families and pursue a safe work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi suffering from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the region , based on a large majority of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community , has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult to deny their living . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before a century , the Arab ancest@@ or region was an predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy took over power and 1925 great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are some of the largest in Iran &apos;s oil and gas fields , as well as some of the most tragic and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population only gets little from this wealth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is often victims of un@@ treated diseases , hunger and de@@ be@@ cu@@ lation .
the Iranian regime den@@ ies the Ah@@ ra@@ zi Arabs systematically in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s built in the Arab areas where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man , and G@@ hom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these dam@@ s have led only to destroy the devast@@ ation caused by drought , and to destroy local agriculture as well as fish and palms industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ ha@@ w@@ zi Group now rose to 81 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director for cooperation , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who completed a job was completed and 45 % have completed a university degree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ as@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ zi human activ@@ ist with residence in London , told us Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of self @-@ moral among young Ah@@ ra@@ zi men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ as@@ him@@ i said that especially the unemployment has become worse . reason is a combination of a high number of A@@ Ah@@ ra@@ z , an@@ upcoming ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since officials and institutions don &apos;t preferred to set Arab working forces , the local Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi used access to work@@ places in all sectors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national contradi@@ ctions and force them to earn their li@@ vel@@ ih@@ oods outside of their homeland . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are people who had to hide their name and sur@@ name in order to be able to hide their affili@@ ation , as even Arab names in the workplace will not be toler@@ ated , because they speak Arabic language or the Arabic language . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi must endure , human rights activ@@ ating human rights activ@@ ates before the situation explo@@ sively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it remains to wait , whether the world is awake and taking it knowledge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is an revised version of the opinion , written by Ay@@ om@@ ide and originally published on the website of Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they can be read in the comments under the original text .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I say that I &apos;m not a feminist leader , many women react - especially white women who call itself as an inter@@ section femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even lay well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be femin@@ ized * and why we should generally be all Fem@@ inist * inside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , women are still less money than men nowadays , despite the same education . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are still under strict observation , if it concerns about what to do with her body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
violence against women is a global epidemic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women have to push a glass ceiling in the past or later in various areas of life , and that discrimination continue to move through the many different countries and beliefs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced that I wear dou@@ bly double and thre@@ e@@ fold .
I am a black woman .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and yet , when I come to speak on skin color , racism , on black girls in the LGB@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I speak on black women in the LGB@@ T community , let not mention many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they are all unanim@@ ous in fact that women - all women should come together to sing &quot; their voices , &quot; to sing their voices ( some ) of women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t want to talk about that in addition to sexu@@ alized violence , there is an institutional shape of ra@@ cial violence that we are exposed to black women at two times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or in addition , that black women and women of other eth@@ n@@ ates and her@@ nia can earn less than white men and women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that black girls and girls with an immig@@ rant background are more often referred to as the school as white girls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that women in black spher@@ es and women are exposed to a higher risk , domestic violence and violence in the partnership suffer as white women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , I want that all men and all men have neither skin color neither skin color ; on the other hand , I can not take care of a black woman who ref@@ uses to take injus@@ tic@@ es both on gender and on the skin color of a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am exhausted and won &apos;t fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminist @-@ orient@@ ated sphere , which always has rejected me and countless other black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 1851 , So@@ jour@@ ner was accused of her speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also consider myself that the black woman is a human and mar@@ ginal being . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m pleased to join the group@@ ings , which also absor@@ bing our customs and customs to promote their eg@@ o@@ cent@@ ric programme . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will no longer try to conc@@ eive white women the importance of the over@@ l@@ apping of skin color and gender . for some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to anim@@ ate them for a better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the inter@@ section femin@@ ism was founded to ab@@ dic@@ ate women of various approaches , and dis@@ appearing from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I draw it before me to release myself fully from femin@@ ism , and having called my status as a woman for my dark skin and my status as a woman who is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tioning is celebrated as a new phenomenon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is more important than ever , that we define black women according to our own ideas and we will go into the spher@@ es that are created by us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ em , the author of the book Afri@@ c@@ ana wom@@ an@@ ism ( about : Africa @-@ Wom@@ an@@ ism : as we can defend ourselves , in which they are completely safe and can be worshipped in those ways that make black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although some white and inter@@ section femin@@ ists will immediately call separ@@ ati@@ sm and exclusion , please inform you about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and contradi@@ ctions of feminist movement , of which the black woman is affected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women to other cultures , as I exist in this para@@ dig@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to my dark skin , I am recognized as part of this para@@ dig@@ m as part of this para@@ dig@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment in which my life has failed , nor ignored , nor rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
p@@ addle against pollution : the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this post by To@@ dd repent@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine published in particular about international effort to solve environmental problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this article will be re@@ published here in the context of a content @-@ sharing agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ever again , Nabil Mus@@ a traveled in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in the can@@ oe - with a special concern through the region Kurdistan in Iraq . his mission is aim@@ ing to make the importance of clean water for current and future generations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this documentation by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the effects of pollution to His church . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to do something for the river , which we had lost when I was a child , &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , the pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Water@@ ke@@ epers Iraq , a subsidiary of Water@@ tender Alliance - which is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summar@@ ises the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water more , how would we survive ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this video was filmed for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary filmmaker and multimedia journalist , filmed and published in Er@@ bil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and processed version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by curator . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # Christmas @-@ free @-@ smoking ) that reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to protect people affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that she had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her exile , who became violent , could do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the end of her relationship was a little time , and the police said that their statement would be put to the files , but more can &apos;t be done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a further wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena , due to mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , the acute indication of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez also useful nothing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few days later the second woman moved her ad .
to break the v@@ icious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women are at all adver@@ ts at all , they will generally not receive support from the State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in many instances , women are also dependent on the men who abuse it . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit they should be victims of violence in general . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cont@@ t@@ 1 blows and statistics 2 mis@@ erable failures and a judicial system that does not underground 3 Paragu@@ ay@@ an laws : good approach , defective implementation and statistics &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to determine how many women really abuse , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , a research assistant at Centr@@ o de Document@@ aci@@ ón y E@@ studio , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay , &quot; explains them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the figures available are al@@ ar@@ ming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the general prosecutor dropped 9@@ 600 ads because of domestic violence . at 70 % of it , violence against women went . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
86 % of ads in the police came by women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence in the peace courts . also here , 86 % of women &apos;s ads came . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the ads , 40 % of women said that they were physically har@@ assed , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but these statistics do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ an female Minister Ana Ba@@ i@@ ar@@ di , only few of these off@@ ences will actually appear . &quot; to any woman who will not do in Paraguay for mental abuse , 9 women who do not do this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to any woman prescribed for physical abuse , two women who do not do this , explained by the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the murder of Paraguay has no own criminal off@@ ense , the prosecution of criminal law enforcement agencies can not be appropri@@ ately documented by their current or former partners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by August 2016 , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases , where women were murdered by their current or former partners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to their estimates in Paraguay every ten days a woman died due to violence by men .

invisible abuse and a legal system that under@@ takes nothing
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insist@@ ed that she named him the names of all their former friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning she did not want it , but then she was after her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos , but one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recogni@@ zable : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I would never thought that I would once become victims of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I read it earlier , I always thought that only women have happened to be under@@ estimated because they are deceived by violent men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment by Carlos Vera .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote contributions to Facebook without name , in which they described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship , and told how he had ins@@ ulated them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people answered their contributions , including Carlos even though . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ically if he ever asked the hand against them and refused to have a form of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why they had fallen so long by Carlos and not left him earlier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it almost seemed like they wanted to say that victims of abuse , at least a certain to blame . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria Santos , which is not from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner they mi@@ stre@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te CRE@@ O ( &quot; I think , &quot; ) that consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the group , they can talk with others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything began with psychological abuse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , her prosper@@ ous partner managed to convince her that they were worth@@ less . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he started to beat her .
Vict@@ ori@@ as adverti@@ se@@ ments in the authorities remained without the result and also of their relatives . she did not receive any support .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it led a process against its former partners who developed into an un@@ search@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and their home country , mainly for money , power and the influence of their former partner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Paragu@@ ay@@ an laws : good approach , lack of implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay , there are many laws which are very good but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a way of contradi@@ ctions and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria Santos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Carmen Ak@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , sees great problems in the application of the laws in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on August 10th , 2016 a bill of bill was discussed under the has@@ h@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # Für@@ y ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this has@@ h@@ tag and the Movement # Ni@@ U@@ na@@ Men@@ os ( # Non @-@ L@@ ess ) are part of a campaign on Twitter which is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original design of the law sees before , to explain Fem@@ inist to an independent criminal off@@ ense , as it is the case in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some points , the Legis@@ lation of the Law has been modified in order to be denied the way for the crimin@@ alization of abor@@ tions that are currently banned in Paraguay up to five years imprisonment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original bill introduced , the majority of the ( bureaucra@@ tic and economic ) process costs , which have to present the victims of violence , if they simply wish to reimbur@@ se the state and provide a safe accommodation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gued that the law does not be effective if the legis@@ l@@ ature does not provide adequate financial means :
in Paraguay mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of inter@@ human relationships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here a must take place , in order that violence is no longer considered to be a little standard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who are silent about this facts , is guilty and we@@ ars that the perpet@@ rators are coming out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have to reimbur@@ se such a long display until mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is no longer valid as normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law of the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . among others , parts of the law had been cancelled , which caused the partners in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
opinions will go apart from the changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the section regarding reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor , to attack its victims again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the words of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from part of the law is regarded as a great blow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

most names were changed to protect people affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; independent media in Oman one year after the prohibition of a newspaper continues to be attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this web site was imprisoned due to a decision of information . &quot; is found on the website of the forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than one year ago , the om@@ anic authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their coverage on corruption in the Sult@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sult@@ ans &apos;s reign is marked by the per@@ sever@@ est efforts of security forces , including freedom of public freedom , including freedom of freedom , freedom of freedom , blo@@ gger and other activists , to be in@@ timi@@ dated and imprisoned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities restri@@ ct peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights systematically , and activists , also activists , their views on the public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closing and the imprisonment three of their editors is a hard blow to freedom of press in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which was reported in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) since its inc@@ eption in 2007 , until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on July 28 , 2016 , security forces Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Chief Editor of Az@@ am@@ n , held an article with the title &quot; high @-@ level parties attached to the judi@@ ci@@ ary and interference with high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report , government officials were accused of having put under pressure against the judge of the Court in Oman , a judgment in a her@@ edi@@ tary dispute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 3 August 2016 , z@@ a@@ her Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a member of the editorial committee , charged the special department and arrested on his arrival by the security forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS took the Deputy Chief Editor of You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as chief editor for Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper was closed at an in@@ definite period when the Information minister had given the instruction that &quot; publishing and dissemin@@ ation of the newspaper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 prohibited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 26 September 2016 the trial was held in Mas@@ kat the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court condemned the three journalists to prison , and ordered the final closure of the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convicted of inter@@ ruption of public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining of the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of violation of a publication prohibition and slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and pun@@ ishments in the amount of each 3000 US dollar capital ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after making use of an information network for the distribution of materials that could be a danger for the public order . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Al Abr@@ i a security deposit was set in the amount of 5000 neo Ri@@ al ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) and was released on 22 August 2016 before the Jud@@ gement of detention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , Al @-@ Ha@@ j responded to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari for six months imprisonment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 following his six @-@ month detention centre in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he served his sentence .
the App@@ eals Court also picked up the resolution of the Ministry of Information on the &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the decision of the Court , Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper sees itself as before attacks by the om@@ anic government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 8 January , the Information Minister issued a statement with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended for three months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on May 8 , 2017 , the Minister of Information was personally extended another statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with the Minister for the publication of the App@@ eals Court , issued the publication of the newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists in the newspaper are not the only cases , in which Oman has been injured in recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other injuries include the closing of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ la@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to hire its operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of journalists Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to prepare freedom of press freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ anic authorities :
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and unconditional release ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can follow their work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
3 . protect the press freedom from the country
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 4 . under all circumstances , human rights defended and journalists in Oman have hin@@ dered their legitimate human rights un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of failures , including judicial sc@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

medical research in Africa : chances and mis@@ understand@@ ings
ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia ; picture takes place with his consent
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; medical research in Africa is seldom or not mentioned in the media . it is an increasing area , which addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the need on @-@ site medical research there are two reasons : to cover a lot of medicines and vacc@@ ines , which cover the specific medical need on the African continent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria have far greater impact in the p@@ oo@@ rest countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for the research of these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secon@@ dly , research , which is carried out by African scientists , is helping to develop their own research capacities in Africa . greater role of science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is director of the Centre for Research on Inf@@ ection Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ec@@ tious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he grew up in the 1990s , in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epidemic was first presented on national health . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Louisiana , later in Indiana . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a post@@ doctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania he resear@@ ched himself on HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ic health system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media on these research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier talks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment , the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I supported the sam@@ bian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , I just start a research program for developing molecular diagnostics tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ V : what are your opinion of the important current scientific topics in your country and general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we only use solutions to have developed somewhere else .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has to change , otherwise we will always keep the receiver , instead of being m@@ acher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the solutions that we get are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use it here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ V : where does the funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for projects ?
RW : the United States and Europe .
the projects are funded differently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to find people coming back or come here , because financing and development chances are better in other countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ V : how is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research work which you did not have before ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not match the standard in developed countries . it costs much money , a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
G@@ V : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ V : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on and how can we support the development ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all age groups .
there is need of special scientific training starting at any age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , study of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ V : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as a scientist in Africa across Western countries , based on your experience ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; RW : often , there are limited speed , things to do , and access to scientific expertise , which represent challenges here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the system that magazines can only make articles accessible against payment ( the so called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , limits the amount of available information and speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change the global food production
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com website and a magazine about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on has been bred let@@ tu@@ ce in the US for the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ ress , the first plant which has been grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost 20 years , Mort@@ on was only sold through his own accident and the question of how many types of salads can obtain borders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but at the beginning of the 2000 , he noticed that more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use the bre@@ eder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the patents are not only for individual types , but also for certain characteristics like resistance to diseases , a special red or green or ge@@ ared leaves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years more and more such patents have been registered on ever more plants such as cer@@ eal or cart@@ ons . because of these trends , plant protection and experts provide food security for food production . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a passionate representative of a m@@ illen@@ nia tradition , Mort@@ on still has more salad , but it always takes longer , because his work is still more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is like in a river a rock bro@@ w must lie in order to d@@ ump@@ ed with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do this now , but it &apos;s a split with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go on salads too far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if they stand before the court , no one can breed a new salad of sal@@ ts because all the features are already patented , and tries to challenge the attributes that he wants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is very careful and stri@@ ves to use no material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also joined a movement in the USA , and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; open source &quot; breeding ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred red Rö@@ mer@@ salt at the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station &quot; the station bred and ate . there will be tested whether plants can be grown in space .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a co@@ incidence that this name sounds rather like this , as the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides the alternative to copyright protected software . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was launched in life to ensure that some plant species and gens are not protected as intellectual property , and can be used for plant bree@@ ders permanently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of the initiative , aka Os@@ si , U.S. bre@@ eder can commit themselves that others can freely use it freely without any seed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to sell businesses and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eder can only sell businesses and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bree@@ ders allow you to cultiv@@ ate so many aspects , which are prohibited or prescribed by many plant pat@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dozens of bree@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the em@@ eri@@ ed professor at the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and Os@@ si board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over seeds and the ability to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds occur according to a role in larger co@@ hes@@ ion like biodiversity , rights of peasants , control of the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eder would attempt to use the latter or not only little by growing seed with natural resistance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg has emphas@@ ised , that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified plants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all kinds of plants might be patented as if vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , will take control of organic farming as well as for example , in August or September 2016 , we need to know how such vegetables are bred , is threatened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nutrition sovereign without seed su@@ cking is not possible . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative committed themselves to other their seed continues to be freely available . in contrast , their progress is patented as opposed to seed and plant issues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ si supporters may be ar@@ gued that the future of food supply is at risk , because the available gen@@ pool because of the increasingly diverse intellectual property rights to plant material , which means always restricted to shrink . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive Director of Os@@ si who is engaged in her PhD thesis at carrots and their availability . she found out that roughly one @-@ third of all boxes feature is protected as intellectual property . it can either not be used for plant breeding either or only difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no such estimates for other plants , but experts like Lu@@ by susp@@ ect that vast crops such as wheat are patented in even bigger style than salad or carrots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a Question of V@@ isi@@ ble
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plants are thus bred that they are targeted - of such , due to their taste or colour to such , due to which they prosp@@ er in certain environments such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opponents of patents on plant properties refer to that the available plant material for bree@@ ders is decreasing by increasingly more patents than ever before , because the changing conditions are much worse than ever before the change conditions are much worse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an e @-@ mail Monsanto will recognise Monsanto Spe@@ aker Car@@ ly Sc@@ adu@@ to , that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Monsanto &apos;s activity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a total of four major banks and cooperation with institutions such as the agricultural ministry of the United States , companies rely on the preservation of genetic diversity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it does not contradi@@ ct that the intellectual property will promote other bree@@ ders , since &quot; patents and the protection of plant @-@ varied innovation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent has already expired as soon as the patent has expired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; often these instructions help others , with another method to come to the same result . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such a protection does not inhi@@ bits innovation , but promotes them by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mort@@ on sees it different : 20 years of waiting , until a patent no@@ ic@@ ate , certainly no innovations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if we have to wait for such a long time , to cultiv@@ ate plants that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one would have lost the battle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mort@@ on is the main argument for Mort@@ on , however , that genetic resources should always be a general and neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incen@@ tives have not attractive to us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is what drives us , and it is impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , Mort@@ on inter@@ fer@@ ed on the concept to patented plant characteristics : &quot; we don &apos;t really create the characteristics themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plants form them themselves and as bree@@ ders , we have no idea how the plants do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a mystery of nature . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Carol de@@ pe , plant breeding in the U.S. state Oregon and Os@@ si board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; those who chas@@ tise his own values in them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who believe on industrial agriculture with large courts and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures are needed , for the cultivation of her@@ b@@ ici@@ des , the cultivation into its varieties of farming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my concept is exactly opposite . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that are based on international markets , but smaller than Monsanto are ) patents do they create the patented process or they keep it too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both are the case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the independent plant bree@@ ders Frank Mort@@ on is looking for salads in his breeding gardens .
photo of Karen Mort@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ eder would be innovative by avoid@@ ance of plant pat@@ rons : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies , the patented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always need new material for my catalogue , as I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a few years ago , &quot; says he . &quot; with a patent you can make it pretty good for 20 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the United States seem to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is spreading quickly across the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , an &quot; open source &quot; seed programme and helps them to breed new varieties that meet specific requirements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them in addition to &quot; open source &quot; seeds , and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German organization Agre@@ col is working on an open source @-@ source license , which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si commitment to re@@ bre@@ eder in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( regulations for breeding themselves differ from country to country , being not simply being taken over to one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Commission , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be patented as conven@@ tionally bred plants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , an explanation is not a law ; now it is necessary to bring the governments of the Member States to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2016 the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organised a conference on &quot; open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , &quot; NGOs and representatives from across East Africa to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards seed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for the Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; Programme for Open Source &quot; seed systems , that the organization currently accounts for a worldwide source of &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , which will be the official start of the official start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a merger of environmental protection and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development aid organization US@@ C Canada and Con@@ cent@@ ration ) has compiled a database for seed and biodiversity , in order to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September , Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others , represents the opportunity to improve and improve the seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report the importance of a multitude , local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems is under@@ estim@@ ating that soon more people will recognise him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has primarily been aware of where and how little is being grown , and seed systems are hardly played a role , &quot; so Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that more than their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organization and blog are the latest aims of c@@ ens@@ orship in Egypt
still unlock the Egyptian public authorities on the Internet .
this time we met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the weekend , the Egyptian government announced the Arabic network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents the human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in August , the network published a statement on Facebook in which it critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Arabic network for Human Rights Information remains true , despite this attack and the mo@@ cking of the Egyptian law and the Constitution to pursue a voice . even if there was never so difficult to overcome these goals in this part of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if there were never so difficult to overcome these goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is regarded as the first cen@@ sored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , e.g. the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ speaking issue of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and Qatar @-@ based network of Al Jazeera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides AN@@ HR@@ I , there is no access to the blog of colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights research Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ ada used his blog for the dissemin@@ ation of columns and articles , which he does not write to in@@ accessible websites and media in Egypt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the blog , which he established to deal with the c@@ amer@@ aman of the Egyptian government , was the goal of an attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blo@@ gger , the supplier of Canada &apos;s blog is based , on the other hand , is further accessible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent almost 500 days in captivity , after he reported on Egyptian security forces and took a video like the police prot@@ esting against two students . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his article revol@@ ves mainly on politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a Facebook commentary , Zi@@ ada said to the lock through the government and reflected what this means : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that blogs are very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ wa al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the lock of blogs may not be significant for the world , it is like me for two reasons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 ) It has succeeded in con@@ vey the feeling of a siege of siege ; a arrest , an attempted murder , sum@@ mons blogs , and any other web site that I worked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2 ) You have demonstrated that I did not wrote in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even though only on a small audience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used to b@@ ypass the search of articles in order to b@@ c@@ ens@@ orship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now after they have locked him and that they might be afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the mu@@ gs walk the way up to the end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . this yiel@@ ded technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , AF@@ TE documented the locking of providers by searching Internet c@@ ens@@ orship and private surfing possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Monday , June 12th we observed like the locking of websites , the V@@ P@@ N@@ s began , began . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such practice suggests to block the government &apos;s intention , to block and filter content that could have access to the Egyptian users . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation is additionally wor@@ sen@@ ed that the c@@ ens@@ ity decisions are made behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis , with which they can proceed from court against these acts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the question arises , how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ orship and who will attack them next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; day for day , newspapers reports throughout Brazil with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of these head@@ lines can be as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old was shot in school , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a police officer killed in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves ro@@ b pharmacy with military guns , &quot; President T@@ emer sends 8@@ 500 soldiers from the Army , Marine and Air Force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a strained financial situation , the highest level of violence in Rio reached the highest level since 10 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice had even called the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports such as these are all day and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 , at least the manager of a local newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for the detailed reporting on violence in the Rio known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on August 16 the Editorial &quot; This is not normal &quot; in which she announced , a new page called &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the moti@@ fs for their decision adopted the newspaper like this :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra will continue to report about crime that devi@@ ate in every big city on the world , as mur@@ ders , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc .. ) This is our way to call in Rio . ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the only alternative , so that we don &apos;t close our eyes before the cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , chief editor of the newspaper said that this decision is no cause for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra is probably the only newspaper in the whole world with a war recru@@ iting from a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explained that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 areas , they are controlled by criminal organisations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Editorial the newspaper writes on :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; us is aware that a war course when it is being dist@@ orted , also used to gr@@ asp@@ ing the police , who only shoots and then ask questions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Mafia and their partner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil has ar@@ gued the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , to describe violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is in their opinion a jus@@ tification of failed security policy by the media and could complic@@ ate it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is no war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the result of corruption and bad planning , as extra in the analysis of military estimates in Rio themselves - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and historical and sel@@ f@@ eit@@ ful negle@@ ct of public service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro is a true most violent place in Brazil . according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country , according to statistics ranging from 2015 to the north and northeast of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities is in the federal state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we look at the cre@@ ep rates in the state , Rio is on place 16 , &quot; writes them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra belongs to the Glob@@ o company , the largest media company South America , which highlights the state &apos;s security policy since years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these safety policies also included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one from the federal state of Rio in 2003 to conquer a fav@@ ela and sta@@ tioned a unit permanently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initially this resulted in a decrease of non@@ violent deaths . for several years , U@@ PP was supposed to protect themselves after several reports about the poor congregations of the poor community , which should actually protect the newly created police unit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his Facebook page , the journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux dated from one of his article from 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria of civil war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from legal issues , the classification of Rio as war makes the severe consequences for human beings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this calls for the state to use means and paths , which are typical for a war . in addition , the int@@ ru@@ sion into the landscape is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and an object for &quot; collision damage &quot; and &quot; mistaken bul@@ lets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war or her , fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio continues to suffer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one week , it is now that the police cl@@ oned the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to reven@@ ge the death of a polic@@ eman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made news : an or@@ char@@ tist died as a result of sh@@ uts , who fired the police from a helicopter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly with Assad &apos;s regime against loyal troops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to victories , a joint initiative for the peace organisation PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , are present in Damascus and Um@@ land , Homs , D@@ eir E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the East G@@ hou@@ ta region , where an attack with chemical weapons struck the lives of hundreds of civilians , on August 21st 2013 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre had been denied by the Assad regime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2013 , these have been controlled by rebel@@ li@@ ous areas outside Damascus , which resulted in local habit@@ ations or controlled from tunnel and control points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat has become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a counter@@ part , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and ac@@ adem@@ ics teach the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ ta as they can plant their own mushrooms as a life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da , and lead the project jointly with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fung@@ i are not belong to the common , plant @-@ based foods and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . but its food makes it an attractive source of food for many residents of the besi@@ eged East G@@ hou@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direc@@ ting of the project , Ab@@ o Nabil Sanad ad@@ minister to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we opted for the cultivation of fung@@ i because they have a high nutritional value , like meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ahmed L@@ eil@@ a , one of the organis@@ ers , reports Global Vo@@ ices to introduce this project for three years and pushed his relief , that it now has more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to collect money for the initiative in consultation with the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is planned to con@@ vey 125 families with plant@@ ing mushrooms , so Dr. L@@ eil@@ a to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12.@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations on Can@@ do until Monday . September 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is dependent on generators , which keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the fuel short@@ age , locally generated fuel is used in order to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. L@@ eil@@ a said Global Vo@@ ices , that they began to insp@@ ect the production of fung@@ al seeds , before they checked their quality and are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , they plant@@ ing a small mushroom farm in a tub . as this did , they used a bigger tub . and so on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they have designed a &quot; apprentic@@ eship farm for the region . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the start of the project and after another 3 months , they were distributed free of charge throughout the east of G@@ hou@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; we want to teach humans the mushroom breeding of several reasons : &quot; break the siege .
providing a new source of food on the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spread of a culture of self @-@ care by eating food ( such as paper , tea , coffee fish , cardboard , etc ) to profit of new foods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities that are tied to their home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; We hope to spread this idea throughout the world so that our success and our fight against hunger and the siege will be visible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want that our experience is inspired by people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people were prot@@ esting on 21 October in many districts in Portugal and called justice for the victims of fires going in the north of Portugal in the north of Portugal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two and forty @-@ forty people died and about 70 were injured . this led to the end of the last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state of state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fires were also registered in the G@@ ali@@ za region in Spain where there were 4 deaths .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire@@ places that spread across northern and central regions of the country , about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June , Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande took a similar tragedy , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors forest areas by satellite , only 500,000 acres of forest will be burned in Portugal alone - an area of the Lisbon area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of Ernst &apos;s position : there is no fire in 4 districts .

the det@@ able tragedy
the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire @-@ control measures by the State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people ques@@ tioned why the civil protection was not able to susp@@ ect the extent of the tragedy as far as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
João So@@ ver@@ al of the Federation of Portugal stated the paper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão streets and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Sunday they did nowhere , there are dozens of reports from open streets , surrounded by fire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy like in June could happen again as the streets were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building permits will also be ques@@ tioned with high Bran@@ dr@@ is@@ iko .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an extensive proposal to the forest , which led the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was annex@@ ed by the community that they saw new rules as obstacle to investment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government led a relaxing of the law that allowed the construction activity of any case , if the applicant could be built in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the environmental organisation Quer@@ cus made aware that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of slightly flamm@@ able wood , as in a v@@ icious circle , according to fires of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to these problems , the website of the Civil Protection Council of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , as resident information sought or tried to contact relatives , was offline . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : they used your own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developers João P@@ ina in order to simpli@@ fy the work of the fire bri@@ gade , which was followed by the server of the 400@@ ,000 users , which followed the fires , no more than half a million access this website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during a night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began through the Taliban . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two years before , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in groups which had conquered the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan became a country of terror and des@@ pair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni took together with his family for the last time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if his mother wasn &apos;t so , she knew that she wouldn &apos;t see her son much longer - maybe even more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the dawn the boy should break .
his un@@ cle would pick it up and bring him to the fla@@ p@@ res .

Abdul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of Haz@@ ara dominant party that was dominated by the Taliban was murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt safe .
the Taliban always closer for their hatred on the Haz@@ ara famous Taliban .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
some days after his escape A@@ shar@@ af found herself back in Pakistan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a few years , he worked in a co@@ hes@@ itation . the work was heavy and made him sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then he took what was left of his little wages , and went to Iran . once again , he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and slu@@ gg@@ ish saw with mort@@ ars who were harder than he himself to earn his own li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was dominated by mis@@ ery and exploitation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the site that we worked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no services there and no heating . we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we don &apos;t er@@ indul@@ ge at night . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and prepared for the trip to Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the dangerous passage on the sea he suffered ship@@ wreck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited island . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Greek authorities rejected asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some time A@@ shar@@ af homeless , ran through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that divided twice a day to eating in need . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for expired asylum seek@@ ers . but it is true , however , that the conditions for asylum seek@@ ers are pre@@ ju@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes the system &quot; suff@@ ers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers is housed in the more than 3000 &quot; special reception centres , &quot; it is impro@@ vised by impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and non @-@ prepared staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they are officially given an application for asylum , after the registration of the asylum application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until then people who have no money for accommodation , either dependent on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it was A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ b@@ ang@@ y life helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after several years , A@@ shar@@ af had made his total savings in the construction of a host@@ els in Venice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was so good , that after a while he was still a second hostel and a fast meal opened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati@@ s &apos;s success story is now the topic of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film won the Venice City Award in 2017 and has already been awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepren@@ eurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Italian - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates around 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many of them , the country is a transi@@ tional solution based on the way to other European countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , some of Afghanistan commissioned businesses , including tail@@ or , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some Afghan restaurants were even given in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea to his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iter and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from various parts of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the menu of the restaurant tells of the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts the history of their trip to Italy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari was opened in Padua , the Restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome also exist in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims to be far beyond the Italian gastronomy industry and the retail , and aim back to the country that he had to leave rather than teenagers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; where is a risk there is also possibilities : &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never forgot my country , and I cannot live happy when I know that my people is suffering . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I plan a project for farmers from the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of the country especially for women .
they represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities as all others . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af for@@ ged plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul , where people can sell packaging and preser@@ ving techniques in which people can sell their reliability and their financial situation , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of successful entrepren@@ eurs was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end there stand stability and prosperity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself . now he would like to help others Afghanistan on this path .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ies Ne@@ ti@@ zen report is an international snap@@ shot , the challenges , victories and forth@@ coming trends in global Internet rights &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian Parliament veri@@ fies a bill of bill , which allows users to use social media like Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a government authority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; users would need to use the social networks within six months after receiving their full name , as well as their ID number . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who missed this step could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment , or a penalty of punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law , which was applied by sixty Parliament members , is currently on legislative and constitutional committee in the Parliament , and shall be deb@@ ated there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May , another MP issued a law proposal to be introduced to the tough@@ er pen@@ al for the ins@@ ult of the president or a high official . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under Egyptian law , the ins@@ ul@@ ment of the President as well as government institutions was already pun@@ ish@@ able . under the law of the law , such an action would have been considered , as right @-@ experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the law is adopted , this can mean up to three years in prison for the convicted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , this would be a political climate with the right to freedom of expression and freedom of freedom in danger already for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) on 13 August 2013 , while transferred to the military coup against demonstr@@ ating the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , as more than 700 protest participants were arrested during the same incident , four years in prison on a court date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , his trial was post@@ pon@@ ed to the 20th May , because the prison leads to violations of human rights groups that were accused of prison in the court room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty for one , so many human rights groups agree with a force of arms , illegal assembly , murder and trying murder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in another case a Criminal Court acquitted in G@@ iza the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for their reporting on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court also reduced the sentence of journalists &apos; Abdullah al @-@ F@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ stafa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly who also had been arrested before the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
listen to Tun@@ es@@ ian activists to sc@@ anned documents
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may , Tun@@ isian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which is the founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ben G@@ har@@ bia has been li@@ stens mainly to a well @-@ driven action plan to ensure that the business people and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of the corruption were accused of un@@ timely funds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the document published on April 21st , on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , throws a light on how the splendid plans to support the bill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ben G@@ har@@ bia refused to mention the names of his sources under Article 11 of the Tun@@ isian press law which journalists reliably protects the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless he joined the Regional Court in Tunis on 09 May as a witness .
wants China to force social media to submit their ID card ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the new rules of Information Office of the People &apos;s Republic of China , users need social media in China to write or share messages in social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
