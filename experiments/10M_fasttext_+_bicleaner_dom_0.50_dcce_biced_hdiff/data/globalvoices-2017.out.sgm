<seg id="102">"" "" "" "Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Komoren, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilised fastly against the ship. they refused to feed one of their harbours and refused to give him a fishing character." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2186">Only recently her country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to help her part: after years of negotiations the Colombian government concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces) in Latin America.</seg>

<seg id="2192">"" "" "" "and that's exactly what they did: up to now, thousands of young people wrote letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back to society." "" "" ""</seg>
