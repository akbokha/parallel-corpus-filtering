this is James R@@ isen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps you might know him , because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long before somebody belonged to Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he published spectacular that N@@ SA has heard illegal teleph@@ ones of American ones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation , where the CIA has literally revised design for an atomic bomb . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it sounds mad , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know what the chapter did not like ?
the US government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for almost 10 years , the government opposed R@@ isen and called him to call his alleged springs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this turn , he became a symbol for the pattern of the government , W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and to occupy journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the first constitutional , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is impossible to apply this right , if media cannot get this information and if the identity of the mu@@ ters cannot protect them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so when the government stood at R@@ isen , he did something that many cour@@ a@@ geous repor@@ ter already did before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk to go to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , just days before the process , something extraordinary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , although for years it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , repor@@ ters and springs can always hide themselves less . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of fail@@ ing and rap@@ ing statements , this could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so the investig@@ ators did not concern himself without his consent , his telephone calls not at home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , his credit trip , and even trav@@ ellers with the list of his flights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA wh@@ om@@ leb@@ lower and ris@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unfortunately that is only one of many cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned the judi@@ ci@@ ary than all US governments in front of him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is home to much of its work as ge@@ heim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result that a W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers went to journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , we set out the field of media in the game , which should be protected by the first constitutional vocabulary , because the government has more possibilities to move all out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but just as technology of the government allowed to b@@ ypass the rights of reporting , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and indeed , they can record it from the moment in which they will contact , instead of afterwards , in the witness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , there are communication software which had not yet been written as R@@ isen had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , which I have been working on , developed today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of send an email , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there you can upload documents or send information , just like in any common contact form . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these will then be encrypted and stored on a server that only has the respective message agency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the government cannot make any more information hidden , and many of the information I would claim would not be available from the out@@ set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , governments around the world develop new spy technologies that end@@ anger us all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is to ensure that not only technology elements such as Edward Snow@@ den would have the opportunity to share iniquity . it is equally important that we protect the next W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , as Edward Snow@@ den . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to tell about abuse during the supply of soldiers &apos; modest and over@@ crowded hospitals , or the alarm for contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a wall @-@ in@@ sider that war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these technologies were not only made for those who want to un@@ cover crime , but to protect our constitu@@ ency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the biggest data le@@ ck of history has been published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ ates Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness . &#93; &#91; what does it mean &#91; huge sum@@ s of money in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; what does it mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ ates Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness . &#93; &#91; what does it mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ ates Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness . &#93; &#91; what does it mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ ates Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness . &#93; &#91; what does it mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ ates Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness . &#93; &#91; what does it mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ ates Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness . &#93; &#91; what does it mean ? &#93;
the publication of these documents gives a small gli@@ mpse into the secret world of the tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ que Fon@@ se@@ ca and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we actually see e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works , as it works . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister has re@@ signed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , there are reports that a bond of the brutal Syrian dic@@ ator Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad has lied into tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is said that a trace of $ 2 billion US dollars to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin , through a close friend of children days , a famous cel@@ lists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people and others , the nervous about the next release , and to the next self @-@ filled documents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now it sounds like the plot of an agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems a cri@@ es away from you to me with ordinary people .
why should this be ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the truth is : when the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all their taxes , then means less money for important public services such as healthcare , education , roads . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and this concerns us all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenomen@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the whole world discussing media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ases of some few are used to hide and disgu@@ ise their fortune -- something that we have been discussing and reveal ourselves for ten years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think many people appears to conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ases work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I put it in front of me like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind this prayer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society , what matters is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it &apos;s interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the USA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presumably , because there was no prominent Americans who previously came in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is not so , that there are no rich Americans who have a wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but through the principle , according to which this tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ que Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we had a datas@@ et from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have links to the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , it is so that you need less information in some US states to set less information to create a company for a library card . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of in@@ transparency in the USA has allowed its employees from school districts to zo@@ di@@ ate school children .
it has frau@@ d@@ gers allowed to do particularly an@@ gled investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does this actually work ?
so we sent a hidden investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 legal firms in Manhattan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our investig@@ ator gave herself to a African minister , the susp@@ icious money wanted to buy a house , a yacht in order to buy a private jet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really shocked us that all by one advoc@@ ate of our investig@@ ators , how he could transfer his money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were all pre@@ ferences . none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course anyone was handed over to anybody . but it shows the problem with this system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is also important to consider this not as a single cases .
it is not about a single lawyer who has made our conce@@ aled investigation proposals .
it &apos;s not about a single executive politi@@ cian involved in a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and in order to master this we have to change the rules .
we have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this may sound very tr@@ unks as if we could do nothing against it , as if nothing could have changed , but as if there will always be the rich and mighty one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but as a born optim@@ ist I see that something has begun to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years , we have seen privileges to more transparency , which concerns the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic took political attention by the British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , the EU has gathered in central regi@@ sters at national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; representatives of both parties have adopted a bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make progress we would like to see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we would really like to see how this Panama &apos;s revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure more transparency in the US and globally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need ordinary people who will be angry if they see , how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ lamps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need executives in the economy , who get up and say , &quot; In@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians to identify the problem and use them , by laws that end this kind of in@@ transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together , we can finally end this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ undering now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the story , as I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the boot space of a red Maz@@ da . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one day after I graduated in my design study , I made an im@@ yard sale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a type in the Maz@@ da stayed there and looked toward my stuff .
he bought one of my works .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was alone in the city , and made a road trip through the whole country . after that he would go to peace cor@@ ps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I invited him to a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you sleep today ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I need to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I just got to know him ! he says that he would go to peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to land in the boot space of a Maz@@ da ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a small suitcase !
then I heard : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
a voice in my mind said : &quot; Ah , how do I ask ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed to the ceiling , and thought : &quot; Oh ! what did I get burned ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a wild bo@@ omer@@ ang in my living room .
what if it &apos;s going crazy ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I got such a fear that I stepped out of the bed , at a toe pointed out at the door , and my bedroom door closed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he was not crazy .
we are still in touch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of art that he bought from me , hung up today in his class@@ room . he is now a teacher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my view@@ point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the people who were sold in childhood when strangers were sold , actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people at my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
let &apos;s make a jump of two years later ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my room@@ mate moves out and the rent is increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that there was a design conference in the city at that time . all hotels were fully booked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think , creativity can create fear to transform into fun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I wrote to my best friend and new fellow occup@@ ant Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought how we could earn something about it . our apartment is included in a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can sleep with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included ; including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a site and established so &quot; air @-@ rats and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for $ 20 at the air mattress on wooden floor .
they found it great and we too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sure we tasted with our cheese ham o@@ ops completely different , because we made them for our guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we had bath@@ ed our last guest and the door to the castle , Brian and I started . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
the things came into rolls .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if one could make it a business concept .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a website , public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms , the art rooms , whose doors are coming when visiting us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Internet you can then invite wild people to stay overnight .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the missi@@ le would ign@@ ite .
but they do not act .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one who is yet with con@@ sol@@ ation , would invest in a shop that allow strangers to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why ?
because we have all learned that strangers are dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have a problem , you get on things that can be good . we could design . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than looks and feel . it is the overall experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who never met before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can design afford something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample to which degree of confidence we hal@@ ted .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comp@@ lication .
thum@@ bs up when you &apos;re ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I &apos;d like to unlock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left sitting ro@@ omm@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this quiet start @-@ flight from panic that you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when she first opened the door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the only thing which is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , see your bedroom , your kitchen , your bathroom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked cell phone of a foreig@@ ner in your hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
so most guests feel like they will stay somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
just once . who now has Al Go@@ at &apos;s cell phone now ?
could you please tell Twitter to post the president &apos;s office ?
you can return the mobile phones now .
you have experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you about some discover@@ ies .
what would be if we have changed a small detail on this experiment ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what if your neighbor had ever imag@@ ined with his name , when he tells you how his dog or his children would have called ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine you have 150 Be@@ en distri@@ butions who all say : &quot; he can really hold very well @-@ locked cell phones ! &quot;
how would you feel then if you had to return your mobile phone ?
for a well @-@ thought feedback system has reli@@ eves the trust .
at the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was difficult for the people to give negative agents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , we decided to wait until both host and guest had given their officials before we ordered them online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how probably it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are about age and residence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; little surprisingly we trust the people most , who are most similar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the more differences we find is the less we trust .
that is a natural social pre@@ dict@@ ate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be exciting , if you add the call of a person -- in our case by ass@@ ess@@ ments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have less than three coun@@ cils , nothing changes .
but one has more than ten but changes everything .
a good reputation is eman@@ ating .
the right design can thus help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted pre@@ ferences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , we drove that trust is dependent on how much you get from . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if one tells too little about how &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you won &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell a lot about how , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- will not accept the inquiry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal degree of op@@ enness such as &quot; Tol@@ le art@@ works in your home ! I &apos;m doing with my family holiday . &quot;
how to create this degree op@@ enness this degree ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text , we also give tips on which topics to write something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help , overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces towards strangers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with which we did not expect , the great deal of people who were more than ready to lay these pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here you see how many people take our offer .
you can recognize three things .
firstly : incredibly good luck .
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a need that was not covered before .
the business is very good for us .
of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who celebrated un@@ authorized parties or houses devast@@ ated .
hosts have allowed guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked on customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile .
I stood in front of the front when confidence has been broken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is nothing worse than these calls . it already hurt , when I think of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dis@@ appointment , which you hear in the voice of grace , was and will always be our greatest motivation to improve us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
luck@@ ily from the 123 million overnight stays only a fraction had a problem .
because people trusted each other .
when trust works you can create wonderful works .
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack there .
his host went to the hospital .
he even sp@@ ends blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travelers to tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra is real guar@@ dian angel that rescue a life even though they don &apos;t know one at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you drive one in your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they don &apos;t want to feel lonely , they pass through books . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they can even stay longer without charge without the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so of course not every stay starts .
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I stum@@ bled upon this concept for the first time , I asked myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does the thought of sharing coinci@@ de with money transactions ?
it goes here to an economical trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s just the &quot; rent industry &quot; to call it , the thing is not just . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people lay a part of himself open , and that changes everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; travelling today , it is possible to compare it with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what would be a rich buffet of local impressions if travelling ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what would be if in any place you visit , a group there would be a thorough and to show a while in a pub @-@ pent@@ ine neighborhood , which one has never heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
or if you can learn a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what would be if we would shape the apartments of the ground up to each other ?
what would that look like ?
what would be if cities would receive the thoughts of shared members ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I imagine cities which allow ourselves to society and relationships , instead of sol@@ itude and con@@ sol@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the South Korean capital of Seoul , this project has already begun . lots of parking spaces belonged to the government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
were residents offered now . students that were in search of a lead were were offered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people were trained by people whose children were gone out , In@@ cub@@ ator programmes were started . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in Share Economy . over our platform alone , today night 7@@ 85 000 people will be host at 191 countries by a stranger or himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so the idea seems to be so crazy about how it was taught us .
we did not re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality was also available before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why did you just work ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aside from luck and timing , we knew that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
design can help us to overcome deepest pre@@ judi@@ ces .
I think it is amazing .
almost overwhelming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every time I have to think about it , when a red Maz@@ da passes by me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know of course that design can not solve any problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use our design soon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a belie@@ ver ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or is supp@@ ressed or supp@@ ressed a brain under@@ wear ?
or just a delay at the airport at the airport .
this is actually true .
I don &apos;t give you blame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people they look like I like .
one study showed that 80 % of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies indicate : the Americans mean that most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those who have met yet another Muslim , it is magnificent to meet you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I say to you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ presso and cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted .
a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ ger Fitness fan@@ atic in
and I am a practi@@ sing and spiritual death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as Lady G@@ aga sings , because my baby , I was not born so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have decided that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I was 17 years old , I met my decision to ou@@ ten me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , not as a homosex@@ ual person , like some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to carry on the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my femin@@ ists were horri@@ fied : &quot; why don &apos;t you press yourself ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the funny thing was : at that time , it was a feminist Declaration of Independence which I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old felt to adapt to a perfect and un@@ reachable beauty ideal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have not just accepted the faith of my parents .
I have with the Qur &apos;@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I read it , thought after , was in question , dou@@ b@@ ted and believed eventually . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow dev@@ otion that deep@@ ened with any reading of the Quran .
sometimes the beauty of the rhyth@@ mi@@ k sometimes brings me to crying .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did you ever feel that someone you perceive , you fully understand , and yet love ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s how it feels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later I married and began like all the good Egyptians , my career as engineer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I later , after my marriage , a child , and lived basically the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came the terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember well where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had sli@@ pped at the end , gaz@@ ed on the screen and saw the word &quot; Breaking News . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was smoke , air@@ planes flew in buildings , people sp@@ at from buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical fault ?
my shock was turned into ou@@ trage quickly .
why should I do such a thing ?
I changed to the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... &quot; In the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; D@@ ji@@ had ... &quot; ... &quot; The ji@@ had ... &quot; ... &quot;
Oh my God .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only my country has been attacked , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others related me into a susp@@ ect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the same day , we had to drive through the Middle West of the US to move into a new city and start gradu@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I remember how to get in silence -- so deep it went into my seat , and I feared the first time to be recognized as the Muslim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we went to our apartment in this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then I saw , and read it and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rem@@ ain &apos;t &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rem@@ ain &apos;t &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed all the week inside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then it was Friday in that week -- the day , where Muslims gather to prayer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and again the war@@ nings : &quot; is not on this first Friday , the mosque could be a target . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive reporting on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who were held for Muslims in the Free Day and struck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were really surf stops on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something didn &apos;t feel right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because people who have attacked this land , attacked our land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;ve got the rage of the people to the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain permanently .
I have nothing against any questions I love .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are the accus@@ ations , which are hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nowadays , we can indeed hear people saying , &quot; There is a problem in this country -- they say Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to close Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as of a tumor in the body of the USA .
only the question arises : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tum@@ our is being removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tum@@ our only keeps you observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alternatives are po@@ int@@ less , because the question is wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Muslims are like all the other Americans ; no tumor in the body of the United States but an important organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , Er@@ s@@ th@@ el@@ fer and Olympi@@ ans .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it might hold a few parking spaces , but do not stop terror . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the regular visiting of a mosque leads to people other faith , and to show greater citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as a leader of the police in the Washington region , DC recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are radic@@ alized in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the radic@@ alisation process it has found that it is starting online . as a result , the person may think that the person may think that the extre@@ mism are true to the real Muslims and everyone who ab@@ h@@ ates their behavior and their ide@@ ology , is a tra@@ itor or belief . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we plan to prevent radic@@ alization , we need to stop the people to go to the mosque . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are still asser@@ ted that Islam is a violent religion .
finally a group like the IS rel@@ ates its brut@@ ality with the Kor@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a man , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we would add to their imagination , if one recognizes it as a representative of 1.6 billion believers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ cl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ide@@ ology bases on their &quot; sacred book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you have a look at it , they don &apos;t drive them out what they read in their &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that they can read these things into the scriptures .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because her would have accused of joining the IS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was really surprised , and asked him whether she was in contact with radical religious leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every priest , with whom she spoke , brought her to silence and said her wrath , her sense of injus@@ tice in the world , she would only bring in trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; being inspired by nothing and something that had been given to their anger , she was a major target for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who gave her a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this image introduced the connection to God and its congregation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of accused her of anger , he showed her constructive way for a real shift in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what she learned in the mosque he kept it away before joining the IS .
that was an insight how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia has me and my family .
but how does normal Americans look like ?
how does it affect any other ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how does 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear every day be on our democracy , to our freedom of thought ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show if we fear , will pass at least three things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we rather accept a author@@ itarian government system , conformity and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one study shows : if you have reported test@@ es news , in which neg@@ atives has reported negative attacks on Muslim countries and the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you look at the mood against Muslims from above -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happened in advance of Iraq war and during two different periods .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to mos@@ lem terror , as I expected it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public , in order to ground the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we might feel as the first but the toxic air of fear touches us all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the assignment of collective guilt , it is not only about expla@@ ining yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple that lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
De@@ ah was a athletes .
he was in the dental clinic of the faculty of talented and promising ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his sister would say to me that he was the most sweet , most generous person she knew . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she visited him and he showed her CV . she was stun@@ ned and told :
&quot; when is such a diversi@@ fied young man ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a few weeks after the visit to Suz@@ anne at her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , she was murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who had post@@ pon@@ ed in their apartment as he had out@@ lined up against Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he fell eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be imm@@ oral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mosque or stayed safe at home ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bes@@ es it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about to let America let us control our children , or one that we can freely practise our religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we opted for the mosque .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat we drove in silence with high pressure on the mosque .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I took him out , drew my shoes , and went to the building hall , and what I saw , let me stop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then the ima@@ m made a notice , than@@ ked himself and welcomed our guests , because half of the gathered were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , ath@@ ei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who had come to join us but to join us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in that moment I collapsed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion panic and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you go on number sure ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or will you join them , which mean ? we are better than those . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you very much .
thank you very nice !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia ; you seem to have met a Ner@@ ve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I wonder what you are saying that you may think that you are a T@@ ED@@ Talk to work a mind with drau@@ ght , thus an exception and not the rule . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what would you say about those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say to dec@@ eive you . I am completely normal .
I &apos;m not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am usually as usual as it is permitted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when people look at Muslims around the world , and I did that with the biggest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want to work and they want to live in peace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so I &apos;m not an exception in any regard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when people appear as an exception , the rule is usually broken , and they are not the exception to rule . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ist , a billion @-@ billion business is expected to be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial drug . possible , this is made in research institutions around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before aerial par@@ c@@ ences in our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the F@@ RAC Centre in France has built a six @-@ metre @-@ high tower from 1 500 bricks . several years ago , they started to fly with rop@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
connecting flights achieve high speed and acceleration in narrow@@ est space .
you can also use sel@@ ectable volati@@ le structures .
they have learned to carry loads to deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and generally respond to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to cross the limits of possible flight in autonomous flight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to achieve a system autonomous , it must know collective en@@ vy , where the mobile objects are located . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for today &apos;s demo@@ s , we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a label of our laboratories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no external cameras .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , calculations on board , what the machine should do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
external commands are available at the highest level e. g. &quot; start &quot; and landing . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear @-@ starter .
a flying device that tries to beat two flies with a fla@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like other strong gli@@ ders , it is efficient in advance , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contrary to most star@@ ters it can float , and has great benefits to start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is always a swe@@ eping side .
a limitation of ta@@ ste@@ ers is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea behind it is that the flight is not able to recover the optimal position , and the performance can be improved by practi@@ sing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during our research , we often provide basic abstract questions that would im@@ itate the core of the cause . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
such a question would be for example : what is the smallest number of movable parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question .
Hel@@ icop@@ ters are known about machines with a thousand moving parts that worry about to hurt you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for decades , trained pilots could fly remote controlled air@@ units , which had only two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a tail@@ gate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we discovered that flies with only one works .
this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically easy @-@ to @-@ control air@@ bag . it was invented in front of short .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has only one moving part , a prop@@ eller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no co@@ ats , hing@@ es and cross ru@@ gs , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , just a prop@@ eller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is mechan@@ ically silent , inside the inner life is very much , so that it can fly stable and move in space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nonetheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear window . to fly it , I have to throw it right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood , to throw it right , is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the moon is an exercise in cru@@ el@@ ty , this machine is here , the Omni@@ head with its eight Prop@@ ellers , an exercise in excess . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what to do with all this super@@ abundance ?
they see that he is only symmet@@ ric .
therefore he is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
thereby he receives the great skill .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the room in all directions , no matter which direction he rot@@ ated or even rot@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the range of interactive rivers of the eight Prop@@ ellers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a lot is available in models and the rest is learned directly when flying .
let us see that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once flight machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this machine consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
these revol@@ ves around clo@@ ck@@ wise
and the others against clo@@ ck@@ wise .
when one builds them up they are like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- can further fly the machine if not limited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will demonstrate that by making a half @-@ air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration examined synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression .
we took standard micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each individual weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where it is and is self @-@ controlled . that &apos;s why there is no upper limit .
hopefully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine there is a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for types such as us lies the reward in the development and the production process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it serves as a reminder , as wonderful and magical our universe is , and that there are creative , smart floors allowing them to shape it in so spectacular way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential , the dot is on the cake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes moved on each other in a very far distant galaxy to each other so the mass of three times in a tenth of pure energy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this short moment long lighten@@ ed it brigh@@ ter than all the stars together in all the galax@@ ies of the entire universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but their energy did not replace them in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire energy was delivered into space @-@ time feelings , and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
let us arrange events first time .
at 1.3 billion years ago there was just a multi @-@ cel@@ esti@@ al life on Earth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then the Earth has brought much more : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God are standing by -- even the internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approximately 25 years ago , a group decided to build a huge laser detector from the MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver of C@@ alt@@ ech -- to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves around black holes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they kept them crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after decades of development , design , conception , and extremely much hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser inter@@ fer@@ ometer vit@@ ational paint ob@@ servatory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following period , the precision of Lig@@ o could significantly increased , which has increased performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore one calls him Advanced Lig@@ o now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in early September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a last test run to clari@@ fy some smaller , persistent problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the detector , rough the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ ly black holes through the earth through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of my daughter
and the part@@ ing from my daughter &apos;s death .
basically they were the fruits of my life .
all that I worked for what I worked is not longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studied using black holes for 23 years and their through ob@@ servatory like Lig@@ o measur@@ able signals .
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a force of force in the feeling of space and time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while passing the wave , the space and its entire content is stretched in one direction and smo@@ ked into the other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for illu@@ stra@@ tive teaching lec@@ turers often lead a real al@@ ber@@ y dance to the theory of rela@@ tivity theory .
&quot; stretch and du@@ sty , stret@@ chy and du@@ sty . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem is that gravity waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 14th September , for example , each of us stretched out the waves and smo@@ ked the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is 20 N@@ ul@@ len after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . Wherefore the Lig@@ o staff was crazy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a five kilometre long laser detector , and that is already absurd , it would have to measure these length to less than a thousand of the radius of an atomic nucle@@ us . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of his classical text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , follows the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cians are Finnish , and with the support of the public , all barriers will be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 to 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott asser@@ ts to Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength that is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your mobile phones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is quite practical , because you can make a picture or map of things by removing the light around you from several points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for sounds it is different .
audible tones have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that means you much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about your child &apos;s face .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , we listen to certain properties like pitch and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now she speaks Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob breaks them up . &quot;
&quot; the number Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we cannot produce simple images of objects in space with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but considering the changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in audible range .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally listen to all literally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gra@@ vit@@ ation is noisy , can tell us about the collision between two black holes , which my colleague Scott has been working very long already . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SH : two black , non @-@ turning holes , cir@@ cl@@ ed simply : w@@ up@@ p !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turn the two bodies very quickly , one hears the same circulation with an additional sound change . that sounds like : W@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a kind of motion @-@ word@@ fish that embos@@ ses into the wa@@ ve@@ form .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AA : on 14th September 2015 -- a date that must never be forgotten -- heard Lig@@ o Fol@@ lowing : &#91; surround sound &#93; -- heard this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 times solar mass , that turn around as quickly as the rods of your mixer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AA : let us think about what this means .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two black holes , the most dense body in all , one with a mass of 29 son@@ es , the other with a mass of 36 son@@ es , revol@@ ve each hundred times a second , before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we heard it .
therein consists the permanent significance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o is a whole new way to study the universe as it was never possible before .
on this way we can listen to all the noise and the invisible .
much in all we can -- practically or basically -- not seeing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why mas@@ king stars explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ ae . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are very useful . of them we learned a lot about the space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exciting physical processes occur however in the core , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon , and silicon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will never go through because this op@@ ak are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational waves perme@@ ate iron , as if it would be transparent glass . I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it because the urine is hidden from its own light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to back to the beginning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most import@@ antly , I &apos;m optimistic that we have never seen in all things we have never seen before and from which we have never seen . things we can only discover by listening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , Lig@@ o was the first to run things we did not expect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says to this topic : me , the kind of stars shine how Lig@@ o they observe , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies of prehistoric times . these black holes are so to speak Sau@@ ri@@ mon@@ g for our archaeological work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lig@@ o enables us to view a completely different angle of view of the events in space , on the appearance of the stars , and ultimately , as we walked out of this chaos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AA : the challenge now is to be as cour@@ a@@ geous as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the cos@@ mos of the cos@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need ideas for new Ob@@ serv@@ ato@@ lian -- a whole new generation of Ob@@ serv@@ at@@ oria on Earth , and All . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for what could be more beautiful than the urine to listen to the urine ?
now the time is great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for one year I would say to all &quot; Yes , &quot; I was afraid of whom I feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter whether it was nervous , made me nervous , I forced me to say &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak in public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I start playing with the show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , no , no , no , yes , yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly what to do , I feared because I feared my fear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my fear , keep speech@@ es , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was a certain yes that my life changed , on an un@@ expect@@ edly art . it started with a question of mine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , called all &quot; swe@@ ats &quot; for un@@ explained reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she had a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; swe@@ ep I need milk for my c@@ abling . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she once asked me whether I could play with her , when I was just on the go . and I said , &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new life of life in my family . from then on I sw@@ am with them whenever you &apos;re doing , or where I go , I always say Yes , every single time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost . I &apos;m not perfect but I will try very much .
it has a magical effect on me and my children and our family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it also has a ver@@ sive side effect : only recently , I understood that &quot; Yes &quot; to play my career with my children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am the author . I think of things , aw@@ aken you to life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is a dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
that is a dream job .
I create TV . I produced TV .
I make TV in big style .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this TV season , I &apos;m responsible for carrying 70 hours of program in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
every show offers hundreds of jobs that do not exist before .
the budget for a television sen@@ ders may be between three and six million dollars .
we say five .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new episode all nine days of four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollar television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three shows , which at the same time are four episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the C@@ atch , 70 hours television , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV shows were running on the Thursday night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all over the world , my series are running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broadcast , which I created myself , and not only produced , so I need time to assemble my fans &apos; camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four TV show , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire that burn around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you know who this still does ?
that &apos;s why I am a Titan .
that is a dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say it , because I know what you think when the word &quot; author is falling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tell you so that all of you who work so hard if you &apos;re now a company , a country or a class@@ room to take me seriously when I say : I understand that it &apos;s not dreams about a dream job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all a job , all work , everything reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I work much , hard and I love it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I moved into the work , there is no other feeling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is , when I set up troops , then I painted on a canvas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so as to carry a high tone , e a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ yon@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love it to work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is creative , mechan@@ ically and exhau@@ sting , funny and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and maternal , cruel and sensible . and the best of it is sum@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is such a change in me , when working is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a sum@@ s begin in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sum@@ s sounds like a busy road , I could drive for ever on her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people take up , when I talk to them sum@@ s , that I don &apos;t think that the letter is ready for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the sum@@ s -- when I began to work and work with the television production , when I began to work and work , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s , this energy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sum@@ s is more than the letter .
the sum@@ s are action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ ming is light and air .
the tot@@ als is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you have such a sum@@ s , you can not strive for a size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the feeling , not unlike any other than to strive for size , no matter what price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is called the Sum@@ mary .
or maybe it also means a work@@ a@@ holic .
maybe it &apos;s called gen@@ ius .
maybe it &apos;s ego .
maybe it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know only that I am not for the failure , and I only know that I love the sum@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will only say to you , I am a titanium , and I know that I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to make a clear : the more successful I am become , the more episodes the more work gives , the more things more , the more I write history , the more I write history , the more expectations are there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
I love work but not true ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the country I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound , sum@@ s , sum@@ s , sum@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I like this tot@@ als . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I only this sum ?
and then the sum@@ ming stopped .
revised and over@@ stressed , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated .
the tot@@ als stopped .
now my three daughters are acc@@ ustom@@ ed to the truth that their mom@@ my is a single employer .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um will not be there but you can write to my N@@ anny . &quot;
and Emer@@ son says : &quot; swe@@ ats &quot; I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot;
they are the children of an Tit@@ ans .
they are baby Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s heard .
the amount of the motor revol@@ ted .
I did not love my work anymore . the engine was out .
the sum@@ s did not come back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I made the same things as usual : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , spent on weekends , no repent@@ ance , no repent@@ ance , does not give up , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me silence was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a preview of Titan .
everything was gray . I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s I was .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so what to do when what to do , does the work that you love , suddenly f@@ ade away ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know , some may think : &quot; Heu@@ l &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heu@@ l &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but you know what you do is doing , one loves to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker and knows how to stop the sum@@ s , when you stop the sum@@ s when the sum@@ s stop , who is then ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what are you like ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the song sounds my heart , I can survive in silence ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then my &quot; southern states &quot; wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way to outside , late and she says : &quot; Mama , you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I don &apos;t want to be aware of what two things will be aware of :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , I have to say Yes to everything and second , she called me not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she calls no one more &quot; swe@@ ats . &quot;
when did it happen ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I missed it when I &apos;m a Titan and my sum@@ s , and here everything will change my own eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so she says : &quot; Mama , do you like playing ? &quot;
and I say : &quot; yes . &quot;
this is nothing special about that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we play and their sisters to@@ ck , we laugh much and I am reading quite dramatic from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in sol@@ itude and lack of life , I can do nothing but to fit out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am focused .
I am quiet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the country I create , the marathon , I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they do not exist anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and mo@@ ist kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wa@@ sm@@ al sti@@ ckers and the song in which it &apos;s going on , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Queen Queen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I &apos;m at@@ me .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me solves .
a mental door starts and an energy boost comes in .
and that &apos;s not at once , but it happened .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s slowly comes back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no full noise , hardly anything , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audible , but it &apos;s there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not the sum@@ s but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel like I was a magical mystery .
but let us stay with the cause .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we &apos;ve forgotten .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sum@@ s , the work bench , the titanium dioxide , that is only the replacement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I ask you who you are , if I am telling you who I describe with the help of programs and television hours and how working my brain is , then I forgot something that is real sum@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sum@@ s is not strength and it is not working specific .
it depends on the pleasure .
the real sum@@ s depends on love .
the sum@@ s is the stream that comes from the lust of life .
the real sum@@ s is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real sum@@ s igno@@ res the pressure of the history , the convincing tasks , expec@@ tation and pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real sum@@ s is simple and original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real sum@@ s is the voice of God in my ear , but perhaps I whis@@ pered the false words to God , for which God told me that I am a Titan ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
when my child wants to play with me I will say yes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am doing this for a solid rule , so I can remove myself as work@@ a@@ holic from any guilt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is law , I don &apos;t have any other choice . I have no choice but if I want to hear the sum@@ s again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I wish it would be so simple . I &apos;m not good in games I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not so much like working as they work .
the Truth does it hur@@ ts .
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer at the workplace as home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this con@@ fes@@ sion is painful , because what a person rather works as to be home ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now I am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am a relaxed guy is none of them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ras@@ hed around in the garden , and back and forth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we make little dance parties .
we sing and play ball .
we disman@@ tle bubbles bubbles .
in doing so I feel mostly sti@@ ff , absent and confused .
I always look after my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my children show me how to live , and the sum of the universe fulfil@@ ls me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I play and play , until I ask myself : why have we ever heard with playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also say it ! do they always say Yes , if your child wants to play with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe you &apos;ll keep me na@@ i@@ ve for a meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you probably have right , but you can do it too ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child finds you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they think they want something else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after 15 minutes a la@@ dy@@ bugs or bis@@ cuit will replace me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and speak my teen@@ age daughter for all 15 minutes with me , I am mother of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are only 15 minutes more than it does not need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can bring about 15 minutes , even in a bad mood ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes in the piece !
no cell phone , no towels not distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner and the children are ready .
but 15 minutes are dr@@ ink@@ able !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is to feel the sum@@ s to have a place for peace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s not about games with their own children . it &apos;s about pleasure .
to play &quot; Play &quot; in general .
treat yourself to 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and preserve it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and be victorious . friends meeting , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; stands for everything I abandoned as I got my first TV show , when I was a Titan in training as I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes more in the piece - why not let yourself be satisfied for 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my spare time . sum@@ s seems to return when I don &apos;t work .
working does not work without games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it takes time , but after a few months , a door , the energy flows , and I find myself in my office . I listen to new ideas . I use it into full trains and I love my work again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I like the sum@@ s but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the sum@@ s that sum@@ s are not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinners with friends .
this is my sum@@ s .
the sum@@ s of life .
the Sum@@ mary of Love .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sum of the work is part of me , but just a part . and for that I am so grateful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is sn@@ u@@ ppe , that I am a titanium . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan , the journey to Jerusalem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I said yes to less work and to play anymore .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I play , the more happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I play , the more I feel as good mother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I play , the more clear is my head . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the more I play is the better I work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the land , which I created the marathon , the sum@@ s , the tot@@ als , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s of life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I feel the sum@@ s , the more this unusual , keeping , naked and new feeling of life in me . less Titan -- more I ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I feel exactly this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a writer . I think of things , I awake to life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that belongs to the job which means to live his dream .
that is the dream of this job .
for a dream job shouldn &apos;t dream of a dream .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and to play anymore .
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very nice .
I am neuro@@ surgery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like most of my colleagues , I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a serious stroke or after a car accident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us neu@@ rosci@@ ence , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a serious injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , severe disability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve function by various surgical actions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sure , they have heard of one of the most known , the &quot; Deep @-@ stags &quot; . thereby im@@ plant a electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of the neur@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease which suffered under heavy tremb@@ ling and heavy pains .
Neuro@@ mod@@ lation however does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the restore of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , I was a senior head and worked on the emergency day and night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I often supplied patients with sk@@ ul@@ ls @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
they have to imagine that in the brain trau@@ ma trau@@ ma the brain is inc@@ lined and the cran@@ ial pressure is inc@@ lined .
to save lives you must reduce the pressure of the skull pressure .
sometimes you have to remove a partially wollen brain mass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of throwing the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this fabric .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cells from a tissue piece can be grown , comparable to small children who will be taken out of your family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and environments to flour@@ ish it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts succeeded Jean François Hollande .
he saw that under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps you still know from the Bi@@ olog@@ y@@ classes , that stem cells are in@@ mature cells that can transform itself into any cell type of the organism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is surprising that this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass is preserved in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die ; they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they were gradually divided and after a few weeks she even died .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but was different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we needed long to understand what they came from .
they come from these cells .
this blue and red cells called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our wholes@@ ome cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us they care for the fol@@ d@@ ment of the brain .
but why are they staying ?
we do not know that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , since we find them in higher concentrations as close to brain injuries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that is not so sure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stand before a potential cell source which provides brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to extract a piece of brain from the non @-@ speaking area , and then cultiv@@ ate the cells as it was Jean @-@ François . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are then highlighted in colour to track them in the brain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last step , we felt it at the emergence of the same individual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first question was : what happens if we feel these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen when we feel the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with monkeys .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first scenario , we planted the cells into a healthy brain and we observed that they were completely taken away after a few weeks , they go back home . the space is already occupied , so they disappear there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the second scenario , we lined an injury and felt exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up in mature neur@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here you see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were tum@@ bled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proof they show them are these small points . these are the cells , which we coloured in vitro , in the culture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we couldn &apos;t stop here .
will these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take feed p@@ ellets from a tray .
they did that very well .
when they reached a stable skill level we have injured the motor @-@ motor c@@ ort@@ ex in the motor c@@ ort@@ ex area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as it would happen to people , they were spontane@@ ously re@@ covering up to a certain degree , just like a stroke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients are paraly@@ zed and then they are trying to recover from plas@@ tic brain mechanisms . they are re@@ covering to a certain degree , as well as the monkeys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we were sure the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the left you see the monkeys that re@@ covers spontane@@ ously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now take a look at the cells , the same monkey , two months after plant@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can tell you that were very exciting for us too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since that time , we have found very much more about these cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we can freeze them and use later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ic models such as Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ plant it with man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really hope that I can show you soon , how to cure the human brain the means to cure itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne , that is wonderful , I &apos;m sure now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know somebody who need that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I definitely will .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human beings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilogra@@ m papers and forms to pass this kind of studies .
BG : that is understand@@ able and the brain is very delicate etc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a fast team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BG : take a look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to take the permission to start clinical trials , as many years it will take until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
at first it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to do this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it requires a long time to choose the patients to evaluate and rate the treatments , whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then you have to apply it to a multi @-@ cent@@ ric study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , one really has to prove that it is useful if you can offer this treatment to everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : and that it is certain of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne , thank you for visiting T@@ ED and that you have told us about this .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we in the West make a big mistake , they are considered obvious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see democracy not as the frag@@ ile plant which is in reality , but rather as inventory of our society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we incl@@ ine to consider it as un@@ changeable che@@ et@@ ence .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and its great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have proved without doubt that it is possible to have a th@@ ri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while the policy remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact the democracy over@@ comes with us in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ably clear that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- did not affect the austerity programs that were realised in Greece .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that moment , I thought that there could be no better jus@@ tification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my asc@@ ents said that democracy would be abol@@ ished when it would change anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this point I would like to introduce an economic model for real democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask you to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group in a mistake , we could save us democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ ensive democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for without democracy our societies are sh@@ one , our future glo@@ omy and our great , new technologies wa@@ sted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to present you on an interesting contra@@ diction that currently threat@@ ens our economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I call it the &quot; twin summit - par@@ adox . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a top is known to you . you know and recognize him as the Schul@@ den@@ berg , who throws his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all recognize the Schul@@ den@@ berg .
but only a few recognize his Di@@ dy@@ mus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mountain of unused cash , which may be too fri@@ ghtened to invest in the wealthy savings and corporations that could produce it productive and also all the things that humanity could produce , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past 3 months , 3.4 trillion was invested in the U.S. , in England and in the euro@@ zone , 3.4 trillion produced , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , gar@@ tens , equipment and so on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
3.4 trillion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until one gets to the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions around the same time and absolutely nothing . except the stock ex@@ changes and prop@@ el the real estate prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , debts and un@@ productive capital are the twin summit which cannot be compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result are st@@ agn@@ ant wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ old people who advoc@@ ate themselves in the US , Japan and Europe , who would not invest in a low demand because his son would kill him if he will grow up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
un@@ inten@@ tionally causes the circumstances to lead to it that o@@ id@@ ents kills him .
this is my ha@@ em@@ ing with capitalism --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its extremely wa@@ st@@ eful art . all the un@@ productive capital should develop , develop our lives , develop human talents , and especially to finance the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for saving the earth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so democracy is the solution ?
but before we continue . but before we proceed : what do we mean by democracy ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as the form of society , in which the open and the poor as a majority government control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy immediately became too many --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it would be a mistake , to reduce the value of ath@@ en@@ ic democracy due to these statements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision on the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy was and is that she was involved in the working arms , not just the right to freedom of expression , but more important and crucial that they agree with the right to political participation in matters of state budget . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy has not been kept long --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a candle , which is very bright , it is quickly burned out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , today &apos;s liberal democra@@ cies don &apos;t have their roots in ancient Athens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the Magn@@ a C@@ arta , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy focused on free citizens and the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magn@@ a C@@ arta , who ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the liberal democracy was only possible when a full separation of politics and economy is possible , while the democratic process has been pushed to politics as the world of corporations -- a democratic zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our present democra@@ cies , the separation of politics and the economy began , an in@@ ex@@ orable struggle between the two , becoming a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two workers and politics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you wonder why the politicians are not so , like before ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not on a De@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is because you can still be in the government today , and nevertheless not in power because the power of politics can be turned into the economy , and the areas are separated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you think about it , it is like a flock of h@@ ows that nur@@ tured so sustain@@ ably the animals of which she feeds , dec@@ im@@ ated it at the end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similarly , it is similar to the economy that has so far can@@ ni@@ b@@ alized by the self @-@ caused economic crisis . the power of the corporations grows , and the management of the corporations are too fri@@ ghtened to invest the cash of their companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the succes@@ ful of capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher the twin summit , and the greater the waste of human labor power and the prosperity of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that &apos;s true , it is obvious that we have to gather the politics and the economy again , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , the women and the foreigners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago , and it was not very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the teaching from Deb@@ ak@@ el of the Soviet Union should be unable to gain a position as in ancient Athens , without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there is a solution : abol@@ ishing the working arms !
capitalism does it by replacing the low @-@ wage workers through automation and robot@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem is that long economy and politics are separated , the automation of the twin summit will be higher , the waste of waste and the social conflicts deeper , as it is already very soon as I believe -- in countries such as China will come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we need to re@@ design the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and we ensure that we use the re@@ unified field hyper@@ auto@@ cra@@ cy , which leaves the film &quot; matrix &quot; as a documentary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements that he has brought forth to survive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is dissolved through a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the human being in the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long discussions the sense of life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think we must be optimistic .
so what would you like to look like this &quot; star Tre@@ k &quot; @-@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation I would like to give you a few examples .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the field of companies : please imagine a capital market , where you are working and in which your capital is working to you from a company to the next , and the company -- regardless of which one is working -- is the property of those working in the company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then all revenues come from capital and income , and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no distinction between those who belong to the company , however did not work therein , and employees working there , but no big g@@ aps between investment and hair , and ultimately any empirical pregn@@ ancies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the field of global political economy : please imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging Markets &#93; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that all world trade fairs are traded in this currency -- we call it the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum of the country &apos;s trade deficit or trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that this fund has invested in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment means are ra@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
basically it is what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , we have them , in particular in the background of a re@@ unified policy and business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world , which I describe you , is simultaneously liber@@ ating in whom they preferred to buried capital and work in the tr@@ ash@@ can of history , and key@@ n@@ esi@@ ology , global key@@ n@@ esi@@ ology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will aw@@ aken in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how to make ourselves politically .
it is in our hands and we &apos;re doing it better .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography itself as liber@@ t@@ ary Mar@@ xi@@ sts .
how relevant is Marx &apos; Analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said is relevant then Marx is relevant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for the re@@ union of politics and business is ... doing it not , the technological development will produce such a massive decline in overall economic demand , what Larry sum@@ mers are known as &quot; long @-@ term st@@ agnation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the transmission of this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next , as we experience it , it will not only be the democra@@ cies that interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this analysis is applicable , Marx is absolutely relevant to Marx . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also like Hay@@ ek , I am a liberal Marxist , and how Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am perfectly ge@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : actually and now we are probably also .
Y@@ V : if you &apos;re not wir@@ r , you don &apos;t think enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical statement -- Y@@ V : actually , it was Einstein , who said that . BG : in your speech , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you spoke very clearly what you think of the West &apos;s view on China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you want to repeat this here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democra@@ cies we have the appearance of a democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I said in my speech , we have limited democracy on politics , during the area where most of it plays , -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in some ways if I may say that pro@@ voc@@ ative may say that China is similar to the England of the 19th century .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is an error , historically regarded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
liber@@ alism and Liber@@ als as John Stuart Mill --
it was particularly scep@@ tical which concerns the democratic development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what you can watch in China now is very the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China has to introduce to what the West in the 19th century did , sm@@ ells great into hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : I &apos;m sure that many listen@@ ers are curious about your experiences as the Finance Minister of Greece of the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I knew that it comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back for the first half months later ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal point of view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting as we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not only Greece , but the euro@@ zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; namely , to say to compl@@ ac@@ ency and the constant den@@ ial that the Eurozone went through the euro@@ zone and continues to be mas@@ sively threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had the opportunity to say on the basis of Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal was revealed -- the den@@ ial was revealed -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers in the Eurozone , within the European group , still have chosen the den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you &apos;re tempted to get a business system that is not vi@@ able to get beyond political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , but if then the change occurs , it happens as corrupt and de@@ structive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : what change do you see ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt about that the Eurozone does not have a future if we don &apos;t change their setup .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- sincer@@ ity ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when there is a finance minister , or any minister , he claims after 6 months in office , especially in such a strained situation , he did not make any mistake , then it is a dangerous person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the greatest mistake was to submit an application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believed that there was an honest interest in the party &apos;s party , to find a common solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this was not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they only wanted to bring our government to fall , just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the block@@ ages organized by the euro area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they did not want to stand for a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
there &apos;s worse than the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; none of the Tro@@ ika &apos;s Tro@@ ika , who has imposed this policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BG : despite all , and despite the aggressive T@@ ons of the talks , you seem to be quite a per @-@ European . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone , comes from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my greatest fear is that the euro@@ zone did not survive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if they do not survive , the inter@@ connected fli@@ ers will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will not only have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe but for the whole global economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we propose ourselves to strike the way of a post@@ modern 1930 , what it appears to me , will it also be bear@@ able for the future of Europeans like the non @-@ Europeans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : we hope that you lie wrong in this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being at T@@ ED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Roy Price , most of them have never heard , although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
probably for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision which Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is senior executive at Amazon Studios .
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , sv@@ elte , has a hed@@ ra and describes in Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roy has a very important job , because he is responsible for doing the shows and contents that will produce Amazon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course this is a very hard @-@ batt@@ les@@ hip industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy is not able to select any one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he needs to find shows , which are very , very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in other words he must find shows that are on the right at that curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB site . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows were received . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your show has been evaluated with nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are shows like the breaking suite , &quot; The Wire &quot; -- &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that seek your brain , &quot; Where is there more of these episodes ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ ler and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- - this should be enough to tell you what about that end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy Price does not cause to get to the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to offer &quot; To@@ dd@@ ler and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he makes more thoughts about the middle extin@@ ction , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t inspire them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so he must ensure that he is really on the right side .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something , so it &apos;s not going to risk Roy Price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he keeps a competition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and select eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and displays them online where they can watch each for free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and when Amazon is free of charge , you can do it right ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of viewers are looking at these episodes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , they don &apos;t know that they are observed when watching this shows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are seen by Roy and his team who will receive everything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you capture , when you start the show when you p@@ aus@@ ed what parts you ski@@ ps and check again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you collect million from data to decide with this data , which show they should produce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they accum@@ ulate the data , process it and this is the answer : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US Sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that many people cannot remember this show , because they were not so good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is just an average show -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lan@@ det at 7.5 -- thus something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time with another company , another manager has placed a top show by data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always searching for this a super show and it uses data for it , but it does something different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of holding a contest , he and his team watched the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x viewer , so the reviews that they give shows , which shows they like etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then they use this data to find out these little details about the spectators : what shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they had all the parts combined , they went a venture and decided not to make a Sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Senator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,1 rating on this curve . so exactly there where they wanted to go .
of course the question is : what happened here ?
one has two very competitive , data @-@ driven companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they combine these many data and it works super for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is that ?
because the logic means that it should work with everything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you collect million data , it is a decision that one meets , then you should make a good decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
it optimi@@ zes it by very powerful computers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Min@@ de@@ ste , what you can expect is good television , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if data analysis works so not working , it is a bit sc@@ ary because we are living in a time in which we are more and more to meet serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
nobody . OK . that &apos;s even good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company , and I hope that no one in this space comes in contact with this software . come in touch , are you in jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if anyone is here in the US and asks for dis@@ mis@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but instead of choosing Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moderate TV , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not always creates the best results , it does not mean that a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the data sealed for the data are also wrong .
yes . even Google makes mistakes sometimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2009 , Google announced that they can predi@@ ct data analysis of influenza , the bad way -- through data analysis of Google research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a great news . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the &quot; Nature &quot; magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it worked fine , year around year , until suddenly it was no longer working . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and nobody could say why .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply did not work , it was once again a sensation , including the withdrawal of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the data has been tested such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite all these errors , data stream in decisions of life -- at the workplace , in case of enforcement , in medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data are helpful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area in which some very clever people utilize in@@ concei@@ vable many data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for a cancer therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
or the development of a medication . over the years I detected a few patterns known about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dissemin@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you need to solve a complex problem , do you have two things : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , you can split this problem into its parts so that you can analyse the single parts ; as a second , you set the single parts back together to hold a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and put together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and now the most important facts : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful you can only solve a problem and understand its parts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not suitable to comp@@ ose parts , and then come into a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this there is another tool and we all have it : our brain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when there is something in which the brain is good , it &apos;s parts and pieces again to comp@@ ose , even if the information is incomplete , especially if it &apos;s the brain of an expert . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , I believe that Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds , where they also belong in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they use data to better understand their audience better , for what they would not have been able to put together all these parts , and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; and does not stand in the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show in which meant that they had a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon on the other hand did this in the wrong way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first when they bet through TV ideas , then as they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a certain decision because they could always say : &quot; we say the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter how power@@ fully they are , data is just a tool , and in order not to forget that this device is quite useful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of you will be ...
before it was data I was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; Magic 8 ball . &quot; it is amazing . to make decisions with a Ja@@ - or no question , you just need to shake the ball in order to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;ll start it later with a technical demo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I &apos;ve met some decisions in my life , where I should have heard in the night on the ball . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them by something much wis@@ er than data analysis to make better decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this does not change the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so maybe the ball wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I am sensitive to this as very encouraging news that in spite of the large amount of data there is still paying , decisions to be considered to be an expert in what you do , and risks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end , it is not the data but the risks associated with which you end at the right end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you very nice .
