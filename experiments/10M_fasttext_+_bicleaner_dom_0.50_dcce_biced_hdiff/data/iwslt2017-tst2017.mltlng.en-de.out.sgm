<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">"" "" "" "perhaps you might know him, because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "long before somebody belonged to Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacular that NSA has heard illegal telephones of American ones." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="4">But there is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "in this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation, where the CIA has literally revised design for an atomic bomb." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">If it sounds mad, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know what the chapter did not like?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "for almost 10 years, the government opposed Risen and called him to call his alleged springs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "in this turn, he became a symbol for the pattern of the government, Whistleblowers and to occupy journalists." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "according to the first constitutional, the media have the right to publish secret information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "but it is impossible to apply this right, if media cannot get this information and if the identity of the muters cannot protect them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "so when the government stood at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporter already did before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to prison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go to prison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "but then, just days before the process, something extraordinary." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "suddenly, although for years it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "the reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, reporters and springs can always hide themselves less." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "instead of failing and raping statements, this could also do its digital footprints for him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "and so the investigators did not concern himself without his consent, his telephone calls not at home." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "just like his e-mail data, financial and banking information, his credit trip, and even travellers with the list of his flights." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "in the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whomleblower and risens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately that is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "President Obama promised to protect Whistleblowers, but instead, the judiciary has condemned the judiciary than all US governments in front of him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is home to much of its work as geheim." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">"" "" "" "since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result that a Whistleblowers went to journalists." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "so, we set out the field of media in the game, which should be protected by the first constitutional vocabulary, because the government has more possibilities to move all out." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "but just as technology of the government allowed to bypass the rights of reporting, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "and indeed, they can record it from the moment in which they will contact, instead of afterwards, in the witness." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "today, there are communication software which had not yet been written as Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or telephone calls." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "such technology is SecureDrop, an open source for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which I have been working on, developed today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "instead of send an email, go to a news website, just like the Washington Post." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "there you can upload documents or send information, just like in any common contact form." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">These will then be encrypted and stored on a server that only has the respective message agency.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "so the government cannot make any more information hidden, and many of the information I would claim would not be available from the outset." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"" "" "" "unfortunately, governments around the world develop new spy technologies that endanger us all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "it is to ensure that not only technology elements such as Edward Snowden would have the opportunity to share iniquity. it is equally important that we protect the next Whistleblowers, as Edward Snowden." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "who wants to tell about abuse during the supply of soldiers' modest and overcrowded hospitals, or the alarm for contaminated water of Flint. or a wall-insider that warns us before the next financial crisis." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of an agent or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems a cries away from you to me with ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should this be?</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "but the truth is: when the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax havens and not all their taxes, then means less money for important public services such as healthcare, education, roads." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "" "" "in the whole world discussing media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havases of some few are used to hide and disguise their fortune -- something that we have been discussing and reveal ourselves for ten years." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "" "" "I think many people appears to confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havases work." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="59">I put it in front of me like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "so you have a company in another company, in another company which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind this prayer." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society, what matters is." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it's interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">"" "" "" "presumably, because there was no prominent Americans who previously came in these revelations, this scandal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "now it is not so, that there are no rich Americans who have a wealth in tax havases." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="65">"" "" "" "but through the principle, according to which this tax havens work, Mosque Fonseca has less American customers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="66">"" "" "" "if we had a dataset from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have links to the USA." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="67">"" "" "" "in fact, it is so that you need less information in some US states to set less information to create a company for a library card." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the USA has allowed its employees from school districts to zodiate school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has fraudgers allowed to do particularly angled investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">We wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does this actually work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a hidden investigator into the offices of 13 legal firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "" "" "our investigator gave herself to a African minister, the suspicious money wanted to buy a house, a yacht in order to buy a private jet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "it really shocked us that all by one advocate of our investigators, how he could transfer his money." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="76">"" "" "" "these were all preferences. none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course anyone was handed over to anybody. but it shows the problem with this system." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as a single cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has made our concealed investigation proposals.</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single executive politician involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">"" "" "" "it is about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="81">And in order to master this we have to change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">"" "" "" "this may sound very trunks as if we could do nothing against it, as if nothing could have changed, but as if there will always be the rich and mighty one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist I see that something has begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "over the past few years, we have seen privileges to more transparency, which concerns the owners of companies." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="86">"" "" "" "the topic took political attention by the British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="87">"" "" "" "since then, the EU has gathered in central registers at national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "" "" "representatives of both parties have adopted a bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make progress we would like to see." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "" "" "we would really like to see how this Panama's revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure more transparency in the US and globally." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">"" "" "" "we need ordinary people who will be angry if they see, how other people can hide their true identity behind headlamps." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "" "" "we need executives in the economy, who get up and say," Intransparency is not good for business. "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians to identify the problem and use them, by laws that end this kind of intransparency." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "together, we can finally end this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering now." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="96">"" "" "" "this is the story, as I almost kidnapped and landed in the boot space of a red Mazda." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="97">"" "" "" "one day after I graduated in my design study, I made an imyard sale." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="98">A type in the Mazda stayed there and looked toward my stuff.</seg>

<seg id="111">Then I heard: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>

<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a site and established so "air-rats and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>

<seg id="135">The things came into rolls.</seg>

<seg id="146">"" "" "" "if you have a problem, you get on things that can be good. we could design." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="806">Neuromodlation however does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>

<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>

<seg id="815">To save lives you must reduce the pressure of the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a partially wollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">"" "" "" "instead of throwing the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="824">After many attempts succeeded Jean François Hollande.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>

<seg id="831">It is surprising that this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass is preserved in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They were gradually divided and after a few weeks she even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"" "" "" "so we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but was different." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our wholesome cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus they care for the foldment of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why are they staying?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">"" "" "" "we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, since we find them in higher concentrations as close to brain injuries." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="848">"" "" "" "however, one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand before a potential cell source which provides brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">"" "" "" "we wanted to extract a piece of brain from the non-speaking area, and then cultivate the cells as it was Jean-François." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="853">And they are then highlighted in colour to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"" "" "" "in the last step, we felt it at the emergence of the same individual." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first question was: what happens if we feel these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen when we feel the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">"" "" "" "in the first scenario, we planted the cells into a healthy brain and we observed that they were completely taken away after a few weeks, they go back home. the space is already occupied, so they disappear there." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="859">"" "" "" "in the second scenario, we lined an injury and felt exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up in mature neurons." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were tumbled.</seg>
<seg id="862">"" "" "" "the proof they show them are these small points. these are the cells, which we coloured in vitro, in the culture." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="863">We couldn't stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Will these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feed pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did that very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable skill level we have injured the motor-motor cortex in the motor cortex area.</seg>
<seg id="869">"" "" "" "then the monkeys were paralysed, they could no longer move their hand." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="870">"" "" "" "just as it would happen to people, they were spontaneously recovering up to a certain degree, just like a stroke." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="871">"" "" "" "patients are paralyzed and then they are trying to recover from plastic brain mechanisms. they are recovering to a certain degree, as well as the monkeys." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="872">"" "" "" "when we were sure the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkeys that recovers spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original performance.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"" "" "" "now take a look at the cells, the same monkey, two months after plantation." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="904">We incline to consider it as unchangeable cheetence.</seg>

<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unequivocably clear that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- did not affect the austerity programs that were realised in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">"" "" "" "at that moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my ascents said that democracy would be abolished when it would change anything." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until one gets to the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions around the same time and absolutely nothing. except the stock exchanges and propel the real estate prices.</seg>

<seg id="929">But before we continue. but before we proceed: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">"" "" "" "Aristoteles defined democracy as the form of society, in which the open and the poor as a majority government control." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1038">"" "" "" "by Roy Price, most of them have never heard, although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision which Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is senior executive at Amazon Studios.</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "" "" "he is 47 years old, svelte, has a hedra and describes in Twitter as" movies, TV, technology, tacos. "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">"" "" "" "Roy has a very important job, because he is responsible for doing the shows and contents that will produce Amazon." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard-battleship industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy is not able to select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"" "" "" "he needs to find shows, which are very, very good." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words he must find shows that are on the right at that curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">"" "" "" "this curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB site. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows were received." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1050">"" "" "" "if your show has been evaluated with nine and higher, this is a winner." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"" "" "" "these are shows like the breaking suite," The Wire "--" The Wire "-- all the shows that seek your brain," Where is there more of these episodes? "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"" "" "" "on the left, here at this end, shows like" Toddler and Tiaras "-- - this should be enough to tell you what about that end of the curve." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not cause to get to the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to offer "Toddler and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">"" "" "" "he makes more thoughts about the middle extinction, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't inspire them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must ensure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"" "" "" "the pressure is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something, so it's not going to risk Roy Price." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"" "" "" "he needs guaranteed success, so he keeps a competition." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1061">"" "" "" "he takes many ideas for TV shows and select eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and displays them online where they can watch each for free." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1062">"" "" "" "and when Amazon is free of charge, you can do it right?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers are looking at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"" "" "" "however, they don't know that they are observed when watching this shows." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are seen by Roy and his team who will receive everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"" "" "" "you capture, when you start the show when you paused what parts you skips and check again." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1067">"" "" "" "you collect million from data to decide with this data, which show they should produce." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "" "" "in fact, they accumulate the data, process it and this is the answer:" Amazon should make a Sitcom over four Republican US Senators. "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "" "" "yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that many people cannot remember this show, because they were not so good." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">"" "" "" "it is just an average show -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House landet at 7.5 -- thus something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1073">"" "" "" "at the same time with another company, another manager has placed a top show by data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. just like Roy he is always searching for this a super show and it uses data for it, but it does something different." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1074">"" "" "" "instead of holding a contest, he and his team watched the existing data on the Netflix viewer, so the reviews that they give shows, which shows they like etc." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1075">"" "" "" "then they use this data to find out these little details about the spectators: what shows they like, which producers, which actors." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1076">"" "" "" "when they had all the parts combined, they went a venture and decided not to make a Sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a Senator." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"" "" "" "yes," House of Cards ". Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 rating on this curve. so exactly there where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive, data-driven companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">"" "" "" "they combine these many data and it works super for one of them, but not for the other company." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because the logic means that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"" "" "" "if you collect million data, it is a decision that one meets, then you should make a good decision." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It optimizes it by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"" "" "" "the Mindeste, what you can expect is good television, or?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1089">"" "" "" "if data analysis works so not working, it is a bit scary because we are living in a time in which we are more and more to meet serious decisions, far beyond television." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK. that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">"" "" "" "multi-Health Systems is a software company, and I hope that no one in this space comes in contact with this software. come in touch, are you in jail." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1093">"" "" "" "if anyone is here in the US and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether or not." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1094">"" "" "" "but instead of choosing Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1095">"" "" "" "moderate TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1096">"" "" "" "unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data," "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1097">"" "" "" "not always creates the best results, it does not mean that a company like multi-health system does not know how to use data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data sealed for the data are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes. even Google makes mistakes sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">"" "" "" "in 2009, Google announced that they can predict data analysis of influenza, the bad way -- through data analysis of Google research." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news. the success culminated in a publication in the "Nature" magazine.</seg>
<seg id="1102">"" "" "" "it worked fine, year around year, until suddenly it was no longer working." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"" "" "" "it simply did not work, it was once again a sensation, including the withdrawal of publication in the magazine" Nature. "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data has been tested such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"" "" "" "despite all these errors, data stream in decisions of life -- at the workplace, in case of enforcement, in medicine." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">"" "" "" "I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area in which some very clever people utilize inconceivable many data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for a cancer therapy" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medication. over the years I detected a few patterns known about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"" "" "" "if you need to solve a complex problem, do you have two things:" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1111">"" "" "" "as a result, you can split this problem into its parts so that you can analyse the single parts; as a second, you set the single parts back together to hold a decision." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1112">"" "" "" "sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and put together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important facts: data and data analysis are just good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"" "" "" "data and data analysis, no matter how powerful you can only solve a problem and understand its parts." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1115">"" "" "" "they are not suitable to compose parts, and then come into a decision." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1116">For this there is another tool and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"" "" "" "when there is something in which the brain is good, it's parts and pieces again to compose, even if the information is incomplete, especially if it's the brain of an expert." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1118">"" "" "" "therefore, I believe that Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds, where they also belong in the process." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1119">"" "" "" "they use data to better understand their audience better, for what they would not have been able to put together all these parts, and make it a show like" House of Cards "and does not stand in the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show in which meant that they had a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon on the other hand did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"" "" "" "they used data to control all their decisions, first when they bet through TV ideas, then as they chose" Alpha House "as a show." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a certain decision because they could always say: "we say the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"" "" "" "data are helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1126">"" "" "" "no matter how powerfully they are, data is just a tool, and in order not to forget that this device is quite useful." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before it was data I was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "" "" "it is also called" Magic 8 ball. "it is amazing. to make decisions with a Ja- or no question, you just need to shake the ball in order to get an answer." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1131">I'll start it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"" "" "" "so far I've met some decisions in my life, where I should have heard in the night on the ball." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1133">"" "" "" "but, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them by something much wiser than data analysis to make better decisions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the building.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "" "" "so maybe the ball wiser and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it's up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1136">"" "" "" "and I am sensitive to this as very encouraging news that in spite of the large amount of data there is still paying, decisions to be considered to be an expert in what you do, and risks." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1137">"" "" "" "at the end, it is not the data but the risks associated with which you end at the right end of the curve." "" "" ""</seg>
