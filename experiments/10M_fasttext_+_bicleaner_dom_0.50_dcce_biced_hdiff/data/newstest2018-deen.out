&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards , which change your view of the city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt where people will encounter young people today .
a tomb was dug then for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers explore the former grounds of farmers .
the oldest official map of Mun@@ chen promotes exciting stories about days .
it was annoying when land cards are not up to date .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone , who had to get more exciting , because the car Nav@@ i took place instead of an asphalt road in a green meadow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the historical maps of the digital Bayern At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bayern of the State Government , are anything but currently extremely informative . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then it is clear how cities and municipalities in the spread @-@ area of Munich Mercury has changed since the 19th century . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the digital Bayern Atlas is a sp@@ lat@@ tered canvas which is not the same as such .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the large over@@ sight card , maps and maps of more detailed maps , so @-@ called primary exposure leaves , were incorporated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these arose according to the Bay@@ erische surve@@ ying administration between 18@@ 10 and 1864 , jumping the first measurement of Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Napoleon had an overview of the occupied land and gave a top@@ ographic recording of Bavaria , of course , for military purposes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , when the French forces returned to the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9th 18@@ 01 : today &apos;s neighbours , which created the idea of a nationwide Bayern map . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max . Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and therefore the Bay@@ erische Under@@ measuring Management . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ur@@ heim@@ ring for Munich origin@@ ates from the year 18@@ 56 and is to be found at the Bavarian State Library website .
comparison morning / Today is the most impressive thing in the capital of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is sub@@ send@@ ling that appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the map creation was founded in 1877 .
today under@@ w@@ ling is in the middle of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the houses were concentrated in 18@@ 56 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , who was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 1878 , a leader of the uprising of Bavarian peasants in 17@@ 05 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where today is the West park , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written hand@@ pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; ur@@ anium &quot; which was derived from the basic tax . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
small plots spread there today no farmers more - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of the sub@@ w@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 , has been the scene of the October Revolution , in the 19th century it was still a meadow - and no concrete desert . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the Is@@ ar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the jungle dial one reads in the area of today &apos;s Au @-@ Ha@@ id@@ hausen , not just the street name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or from the hill &quot; On the air &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ field Road they once locked up people with ma@@ dness .
there was in 1858 / 59 the Munich @-@ district ir@@ rig@@ ation &quot; on the Au@@ er Lü@@ beck .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den led the establishment of that psychiat@@ rist , associated with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and ended for example the acqu@@ isitions of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also allowed the staff to contact the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum Ha@@ id@@ hausen , who has been employed for an exhibition with the age of An@@ st@@ alt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for 280 patients , first place was first , later it was extended to 500 places . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at some point this capacity was not enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreis@@ ir@@ is in Hair 1905 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2006 , Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ East , one of Germany &apos;s largest Psychiat@@ ry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the premises of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt young people meet up in the Munich Sal@@ es@@ an@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Order has acquired the building complex in 1920 , and walked into a youth home with training . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football field of the TS@@ V München East , east of residential houses from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was erected in architec@@ turally based on the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ zy who had been destroyed during the Second World War in bombing ra@@ ids . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mari@@ en@@ platz was about 18@@ 56 as &quot; the main square &quot; which was called the Kauf@@ ing@@ er@@ straße &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the Allies destroyed many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a big remained until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English Institute , small business buildings and a tomb of the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ en@@ hof where the ground @-@ breaking ceremony took place on 5 April 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the sli@@ der , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole in the Mari@@ en@@ hof . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
citizen group publishes travel@@ ogue for Mis@@ sour@@ i
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Association for the promotion of color@@ ants has issued a warning for coloured people , who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discri@@ min@@ atory policy and ra@@ cial attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Council for the federal state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which should come into force on August 28 , 2017 , is demanding attention through the state , because a number of question@@ able , ra@@ cial incident occurred recently in the entire state and listed here , says it is in the position of the group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes people difficult to gain dis@@ criminal claims , as well as the prosecution of prosecution , promp@@ ted the group to release the travel warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they have injuries of the civil rights that happen to people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are stopped or killed because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , Kansas City Star . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first such warning , which the organization issued for a state in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the group cited events such as rac@@ ist betra@@ y against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ anders died at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state , and from the police arrested by Mis@@ sour@@ i without accused of a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council also refers to a recently published report by Mis@@ sour@@ i &apos;s office , which is shown that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more common than whit@@ eness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; people have to be willing to bring their money to their money or their relatives that they travel through the state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i reported 100 H@@ ass@@ les in 2015 , after the latest numbers from the FBI report and the FBI , based on the number of such injuries to the 16th place of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult , a company because of residential or employment discrimination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued travel warning for Texas and Arizona after immigration laws which contribute to the local criminal law enforcement officials , which will contribute to further development purposes according to AC@@ L@@ U . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; travel war@@ nings are generally issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but recently , stakeholders have used the action as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
female gate project is elementary
the Fishing Contest Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ n @-@ Project is a successful project and will continue next year .
the CDU federal Parliament Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac made a picture on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the yard of the Schwen@@ demann family , representatives of the fisher@@ man &apos;s CDU village joined together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Markus Schwen@@ demann appro@@ ves insights into his farm where he provides 55 hectares of law@@ ns and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and equally rich in five apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for him , the &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ ald milk &quot; is for him the alternative marketing way for the milk of his cows , so swing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ in@@ est comes exclusively regional .
since it is also BL@@ HV @-@ chairman of a fishing village called &quot; elem@@ ental project &quot; as a &quot; elementary @-@ scale project . &quot;
I can not be profitable to such steep surfaces .
the green area care for a lot of work and many need to be mach@@ ined with the brus@@ h@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we used to fight with the conditions and the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2003 he took over the el@@ ter@@ nal plant and received this without chemical plant protection and fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers , even if he do not perform bio operation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognized the significance of the ref@@ us@@ sing project and is glad through the leader funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare , farmers should be supported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope this could be moved out for a while , so that there could be a while . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have , are the people who work in agriculture and make their thoughts on how they continue their farm , &quot; empha@@ sized the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often in criticism because of the promotion
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the opening area is 40 hectares that cannot be consul@@ ted until at least 20@@ 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the total cost of EUR 71 million , half over leader was promoted , a quarter of the municipality of Fishing bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the farmers managed to invest 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ gevity of the f@@ ences &quot; explained by demann .
K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you do not do a good job without farmers and land women . &quot;
also for Peter White stand firm : &quot; the best food is produced here . &quot;
the state @-@ care policy ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows state support of pa@@ stu@@ res .
the goal of the Schwar@@ zw@@ alds is a goal .
pre@@ mise is the presence of one of the L@@ PR @-@ recorded conv@@ ey@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the fenced area should not be fla@@ wed ( hang@@ ar over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by rest@@ or@@ isation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the Fishing Contest Wei@@ ghts project in 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build under 16 kilometers of fence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the equity area corresponds to 35 hectares and the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euros .
is nothing sacred ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes off the Statue of Liberty
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the saf@@ est signs of a regime change is , when they start to attack statues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence , the overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos Square in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , knew what he did when he took a symbolic A@@ xe in a heated war with Jim A@@ co@@ sta in a heated limitation of the legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be fair , Miller was not access@@ ing the statue itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a Hor@@ de of boat @-@ owner and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ators would have laughed at him when he had done it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he took their meaning , and especially the importance that it was attributed to him as the famous poem of Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , his base was added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Miller said A@@ co@@ sta : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go down here to a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that lights the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the poem which you refer to that later was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Miller is properly correct , but how he formulated it himself , it isn &apos;t really the story . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about the contemporary resonance on the touching words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state would not only invite you to breathe freely , but to breathe freely , / the end of your rich co@@ asts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; el@@ ende waste &quot; was better to see on our screen .
Miller was not involved in literary criticism - he made sure that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ ump USA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural discussion : it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lazarus and her friends , they were using their words after their deaths on the base - knew very well that they were accomplished with a highly political action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sculpture was to show the connections between French and American Repub@@ lic@@ ism , showing the female em@@ bodi@@ ment depicting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem is the female character no longer abstract - she has received a voice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and she herself is a different name : mother of expres@@ si@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the link to the image with the image is a brilliant feminist c@@ p , and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , just how Lazarus changed the meaning of this statue , people wanted to change the right wing of this right wing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the big scre@@ am Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Bap@@ ti@@ zer for the coming from Tr@@ ump , ar@@ gued in 2010 that the statue of Liberty has no one to invite the American flame to die around the world : &quot; Lady Liberty goes forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it should wear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not shine through the United States . &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is very unusual here .
the meaning of the statue is quite and not a question of the stand@@ point of perception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great imagin@@ ative fact of Lazarus it was to see how they saw from the exhaus@@ tive , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible travel on the decks of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the true sense , it is about to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome , which they must hear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and of course , this is not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump want to recognize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her tor@@ ch should not shine the way , but the hatred , which is their only source of power . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
world Championships 2017 : Neil Black pra@@ ises the Scottish members of the Great Britain
E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle re@@ members at a time when only two Schot@@ ts belonged to the team from Britain
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the power director of the Ath@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish conven@@ tions will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 on Friday .
black believes that &quot; in Scotland develops something special &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom has to learn something from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we will continue , until we &apos;ll find out , &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals @-@ candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart , who were elected to the team captain Far@@ ah at the 5.000 m circuit , while E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle was chosen from the crew to the team captain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ ie is quite modest .
their captain &apos;s speech was incredible . &quot; says Black .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a series of athletes , no matter whether they were Scottish or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and genuine feeling , the E@@ ili@@ ie quite naturally , were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commonwealth of silver medal winner who will compete with their fifth world championship in the 400 m hur@@ dles , says that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbelievable that 16 Schot@@ ts are in the British Team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best total number of athletes in the World Championship were seven , which was reached in 1983 and 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the middle range of Mu@@ ir takes five British and two European records last year , and last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is part of the 1,500 m and 5,000 m rounds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1,500 m runs , is another gr@@ otto that was observed after a great season to watch the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world championship race as the only other competing in the team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crew capit@@ alists says that they are extremely proud of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also with the medals and the fin@@ alists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is so special about team captain &apos;s team is to know that they voted for me by the other members of the team , but to know that my te@@ amm@@ ates voted for me and voted to me something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; obviously I &apos;m very proud of all the Scotland who belong to the team .
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes who want to climb to Po@@ di@@ ums .
what is my speech concerned as captain ?
yes . I think she went well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , since we have a home Championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it &apos;s really important to put on this home support , and benefit from that we are back at the Olympiastadion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go down and compete , and there will be just a great atmosphere there to be outside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blocking Cre@@ ators via Facebook : don &apos;t make you a public office if you do not toler@@ ate the heating of voters
the Father of our land knew something of worse media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers beat him because of the Domestic Policy to his political principles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he p@@ imp@@ ose on the cri@@ tique of criticism .
but he did not take his critics into silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; the freedom of speech can be removed - and , dum@@ b and dum@@ b we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this brings me to Maryland the governor of Larry H@@ ogan , who must work for more like Washington . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gan@@ s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 persons , which have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union was har@@ med him at the beginning of this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the govern@@ ors reli@@ ed the law@@ suit as fri@@ vo@@ l , and the online comment was full of a response with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it &apos;s especially important when it is a guy like H@@ ogan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a republi@@ can governor in a overwhelming democratic state , which is amazing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has the second cl@@ utter@@ ed approval of the 50 govern@@ ors in the nation .
H@@ ogan is no re@@ ac@@ tionary heat head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he showed a strong hand with the leadership of his state and strict observation of the principles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was also very sk@@ ill@@ fully to use Facebook as a primary means to de@@ duce oneself with his elec@@ tors and to de@@ duce his hair@@ less head to chemotherapy on his side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the block of persons that come to the govern@@ ors page - which is called a public forum , which will be officially called by public tax @-@ Dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan@@ s Spe@@ aker was speaking the acts of govern@@ ors and ar@@ gued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is too simple to use the picture of tro@@ ut or gas chambers or has@@ ser@@ y people , which vibr@@ ate online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the mail spoke to some of the real people that were blocked by H@@ ogan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , a business@@ man , and a pastor , no tro@@ ll@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ght@@ ful and not prof@@ iting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the priest accepted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to the Catholic faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . he didn &apos;t want to leave , but she asked for H@@ ass@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I was comm@@ ited that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to H@@ ass@@ ver@@ dic@@ ate and other latest news , &quot; wrote them in the comments box &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people play on the same topic , then they will be mi@@ red as a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for govern@@ ors as &quot; concentrated spam attack , &quot; others would probably call &quot; inter@@ language &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Facebook era makes it easy to cut out a message by simply blocked a critic or delete a negative comment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is much cleaner than in former times when you have done the same , that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical conduc@@ tors and to inc@@ ense or disman@@ tle the prot@@ esters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but exactly this has happened digitally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ogan designed not the first public official , who is cri@@ tici@@ zed that he has claimed fac@@ ebook and other social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ aded by Twitter users that were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question was last week in Virginia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ visors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County , last the First Am@@ end@@ ment , called James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she ban@@ ishes a voters from their Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of its use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington the time of affordable Por@@ tos had similar effects as the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the number of newspapers summar@@ ised between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous stamp references to his lead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and even then Washington had anonymous Tro@@ ll .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people who p@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us &quot; , &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; used , wrote all the letters of newspapers , who made Washington decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; peti@@ tions , who critic@@ ised his position on the treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and navigation with Britain , over@@ powered his office , according to historical documents that were collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he has not brought her to silence .
freedom of speech and dis@@ courses are among the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means to accept this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty is hoping for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for the next three days in the next three days , since the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ tery runs the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led the last year in the Ar@@ cher@@ field links until the final round , before he lost the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen as the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how it reaches its glory with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from his best side , he is in a great state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jerry has done a great job when he laid out this place .
he is an ar@@ dent supp@@ orter of this game and is proud of its performance here .
this is a great showcase for that course . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , although he has won in his 32 @-@ year career as well at the European Challenge Tour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that really feels really special &quot; he said in South@@ port .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I could not defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura open , as it was won in the year after I had won them from the program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos;s a wonderful place to golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the memories come back from the last year , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year to win here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always be appreciated . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came after his 50th birthday in this year at the European Senior Tour , returns to the action of the homeland . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this event will be its first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a little more if you play home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you want to make it good but you feel it extra pressure too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really enjoyed playing , and I played a solid club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m glad about how it has gone so far . &quot;
with the trio in the field are the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ber .

less lung cancer caused by passive smoking
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past two decades , fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists of the University Clinic Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) come to this result in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 pne@@ um@@ b@@ ins have been due to passive smoking per year , &quot; said study manager Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a comparison , he had a study on this subject in 1994 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then there was 400 lung cancer due to passive smoking in Germany due to passive smoking .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house inclu@@ sions prove to be very complex
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the construction works at the Vill@@ inger Street are in full swing and are located in time , &quot; says the Director of the Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of the house inclu@@ sions the location is more complicated than susp@@ ects , as in the sub@@ strate , what is not noted in the plans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the traffic , which always ob@@ struc@@ ted the construction works , represents a big problem for the part of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of drivers against red lights and bul@@ locks is already huge &quot; says Hein@@ ze .
the street is locked and only the bus stops are justified .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Marvin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p have been working with the work on the bridge for weeks .

poverty and death in the Indonesian gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks the dinner there is no stove .
they even used a pot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai rule in the quiet ind@@ ones@@ ian province of Papua , the house@@ wife is usually called a sweet potato - locally called &quot; Not@@ a &quot; - right in the fireplace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half an hour , the knot@@ ty stu@@ ffed is taken with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay soil - it has no furniture - where they also leave their daily work for example clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a cabinet .
the youngest of the four wives of her husband were not assigned to her fields .
Poly@@ gam@@ y is custom@@ ary here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course it can be dangerous to work late : most villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many drink hard , and there are the soldiers here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; nobody will dare to run after 17 o &apos;clock in the village . &quot; she says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a rare insight into the everyday life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was accepted in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , as only 1,0@@ 26 elder should vote in front of the occupying troops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an existing movement , which led to independence against the Dutch rule , turned out quickly against the government of Jak@@ arta , who maintains its control over the region and exclu@@ de foreign journalists or legal observ@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Papua New Guinea , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea as the eastern part of the island . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as isolated as it is desert . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire , and then a morning 5 hour drive by car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no public transportation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the town with approximately 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bam@@ boo trees , and corrugated cla@@ ws , which were converted through r@@ ust in various yellow @-@ brown tones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only very few Indonesian did their journey here , because journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before Christian mission@@ aries transfer the Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wear these clothing , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and indicates their lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the past we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Papua is the largest of Indonesia , where 28 % of men live under the poverty line and some of the worst children &apos;s mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Indonesia is also of Indonesia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the largest and most profitable gold @-@ mine of the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , Fre@@ ep@@ ort expanded its worth of 3.1 billion US dollars and copper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it also has wooden resources worth estimated $ 78 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , these riches are a source of mis@@ ery for the Papua , ensuring that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military has preserved a ch@@ oked presence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid local military personnel and units from 1998 to 2004 , including up to 150,000 US dollars on a single officer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these Golden G@@ ans thre@@ aten these golden demands for greater autonomy and will be treated mer@@ cil@@ ess .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to information of activists , more than 500,000 troops were killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed by the Indonesian military since 1969 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mass graves in Pap@@ u@@ as tribe in the 1970 &quot; s became the genocide of genocide according to the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the region alone , Indonesian police arrested more than 3.@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know everything &quot; means in a report of the Arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Brisbane from 2016 , in the reports about atro@@ cities and torture - rape and power cuts are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal defeat of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as every week , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the screws have reinforced , because Pap@@ u@@ as resources have a influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demo@@ graphic development changes from the most popul@@ ous islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sumatra and Su@@ la@@ wes@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jav@@ an@@ ese War@@ ung cant@@ ons sell roasted chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pean@@ ut sauce served .
local people fight for here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua New Guinea , &quot; A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai local native , who moved to the province capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it has the native State - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Papua - it cost its market . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known as the Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised the ine@@ qualities and the legal injuries in Papua during his election campaign in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Zimmermann gets 27 of the 29 districts of Papua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai , on the way to the Presi@@ dential Palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in Papua New Guinea had changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken , because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 with the anticip@@ ation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact Pan@@ i@@ ai was actually going up only two months after the Jok@@ ow@@ is inauguration in October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in du@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two ind@@ ones@@ ian soldiers broke out on a motorcycle through the darkness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dam@@ ned children told them that they should turn their head@@ lights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the soldiers took a stum@@ bling on her tone , and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the soldiers who had drunk , and wounded the group with their rif@@ le pist@@ on , said offerings and witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then one of the soldiers hum@@ bled into the group of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , became so hard to hit the coma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and the things were escal@@ ated on the next day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approximately 1,000 young women , women and children were gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Center to demand justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they carried out the hunting grounds and led the Wa@@ ita Dance - in the circle and a bird @-@ se@@ ang - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators started to drag bricks on police and military posts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the atmosphere was heated , the soldiers were sent into an internal radio : &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official document of TIM@@ E which has not been released to local media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ Four district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for rest and called the crowd to return home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I suddenly turned into my lin@@ kes wrist , &quot; he said TIM@@ E on the porch of his colourful wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kay@@ ak still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the bul@@ let came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times so his c@@ ousin was the witness of shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; he said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who carries only a name , the TIM@@ E in a dark mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the che@@ er spec@@ tor of Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said Rep@@ orters that his officers only wanted to secure their station , because they are being attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves if people thre@@ aten , kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of Papua police , Commissioner P@@ ud@@ jo Sul@@ ei@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the news about the k@@ illings came first &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta on the following day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three weeks Jok@@ ow@@ i was a passionate talk in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he testi@@ fied to the families of the victims and s@@ wore to historical failure in Papua . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like that this case will be solved immediately , so it will no longer happen in the future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Minister Se@@ anto said in October 2016 that he set up an extra@@ judicial mechanism for laying historic human rights violations .
but the words started almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries have occurred long ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and at the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes that have to pass through , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke with TIM@@ E on 5 June in Jak@@ arta , and said he has no plans to set up in Papua a complaint mechanism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead everything is regulated by law . &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wir@@ anto , who accused the UN for crimes against humanity &quot; was said that 11 cases of human rights violations in East Tim@@ or had already been buried , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took such claims with an un@@ belie@@ ver un@@ belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed during the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear later .
&quot; I am afraid . &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have fear of being arrested by the military , have fear of being shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the opinion that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai fear to discuss the incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says that he was beaten by the military , after he helped him to bury four of the victims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the dead bodies , the military sought after me , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police on villa@@ gers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during a confron@@ tation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring a conscious man into the hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , among them also children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man , the 24 year old Ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
excited village people prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s sit@@ ing office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers , re@@ acted by warning shots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but locals say that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were so panic that there will be reven@@ ge for reven@@ ge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u Ba@@ di@@ i who was in the vicinity of the hospital and witness how the injured here came quickly , the TIM@@ E . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I have two days hidden in my house . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to draw the officers of the ac@@ count@@ ability and withdraw the police from the territory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a disaster for Indonesian government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the tri@@ bal community of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dani and Dam@@ al who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of the &quot; Free Syrian Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel Army , claims to defend the rights of Papua , by attacking spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings by ind@@ ones@@ ian soldiers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the top @-@ O@@ PM leaders are from Pan@@ i@@ ai among them Ta@@ di@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ k@@ K@@ og@@ o@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai and detained in custody , under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing the national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some never go up again .
among men in Papua Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic and forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice that is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just out of reach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people here build everything they eat , especially not@@ a fruit and fruits and vegetables . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agriculture is the task of women , who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you retain the majority of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10.000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the indigenous peoples and the new migrants who have arrived at Nab@@ ire in greater numbers since the opening of new flight operators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the few work@@ places that exist in the region , usually go to the better trained and aff@@ lu@@ ent migrants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Papua , Papua have rarely imposed the capital or the necessary skills to make their own company competitive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... as there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Chief Executive Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation holds the eyes of the world of Papua .
furthermore restrictions on international media remain e@@ ager@@ ly awa@@ ited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although rare permission was given to films . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of j@@ ow@@ is election campaigns have been able to enhance transparency and development , not realised . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to tell of Indonesia &apos;s un@@ calm eastern provinces of Papua and Western pap@@ ua , try the visa ref@@ using and a black list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press review means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to the immediate neighbors Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March , six Pacific countries - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua including Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same countries have historically been supporting O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha Na@@ si@@ r denied the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia , there is still a democratic system and there are free media , making evidence of human rights failures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people want to know more foreign governments to know this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a official delegation from the Netherlands , attended by the Human Rights ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura left her silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also wants to remain anonymous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2019 , Indonesia opened another presidential election , but the Papua say that it probably won &apos;t be back again for Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the pan@@ i@@ ai committees , &quot; says Gob@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wants to know that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it lives under the constant threat of a rob@@ ber@@ y military , is in poor digestion and healthcare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ i says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , cont@@ empl@@ ate their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; which he must pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need any money ; they just want justice . &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the threats and inti@@ mid@@ ations , families of the pan@@ i@@ ai flock made a last symbolic act of the Trot@@ sky@@ ist : the body of a victim was buried in a terrain right over the police and the military station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they know that they may never have justice to them , but at least they will not forget their crimes committed in their crimes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed : &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with sin@@ king head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai to the second time
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in Dubai in Dubai , and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 3@@ 37 meter high , 79 @-@ storey building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the second fire that crosses the tower in just two years , that is acci@@ dently called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries have been reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we slept and we were sitting at the Fire alarm and the scre@@ aming of the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get from the 50th floor to come down , &quot; a resident , who suff@@ ers from his name as George , Reuters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dub@@ ais civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting cost around 4.@@ 00 local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) fires bla@@ sted and cooled the building .
the government said it is working on the provision of accommodations for the people concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident can have questions concerning the safety of materials , which are used in outdoor areas throughout the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation through the management of the Tor@@ ch building according to its fire in 2015 revealed that the biggest part of the covering , the outer cla@@ dding for decoration or insulation came . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Britain , the police declared that the system of plates for insulation and covering at the London gren@@ ades tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in June . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no Davis Cup Reform : keep Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through its large Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the Annual General Assembly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Ho Chi Minh City session , the two @-@ third majority was not supported by the required two @-@ third majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the often very long , but even very highly valued five @-@ set classics remain to the traditional value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of the member countries agreed to reform the goal of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was just scar@@ c@@ ely missing .
&quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term fut@@ ures of this iconic and historical cont@@ ests , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will continue to work to improve the application .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only for the vote was the proposal before the proposal before the proposal , the final at a neutral location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new from 2018 are only comparatively smaller details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the final round in the next round in the first round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to reduce the cost of the organizer , the requirements in training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will need to complete official media schedule prior to the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 1 of 5 US travelers brings forbidden objects into the aer@@ op@@ lane , finds out a survey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a survey of flight designs revealed that more than 20 percent consci@@ ously , or un@@ consci@@ ously forbidden objects to control the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security administration , among them at least 6 percent , while they acci@@ dentally contributed forbidden knives or other items with kni@@ fes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less than 1 percent claimed , they would have discovered that they had gone wrong with fire@@ arms , am@@ mun@@ ition or explo@@ sives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the survey of more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a Jet @-@ Char@@ ter@@ service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also realized that younger trav@@ ellers fell rather the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from those ques@@ tioned that they have tried to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent m@@ illenni@@ als were compared with less than 15 percent , members of the generation X were . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common items , which were deliber@@ ately tow@@ ed by T@@ SA agents , were food and liquids . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 3 percent issued to have borne ill@@ iter@@ acy subjects by security control , while 2.2 percent of female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of those surve@@ yed they confirmed that they had deliber@@ ately banned drugs throughout the plane . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said , people ques@@ tioned throughout the country in order to find out how many acci@@ dentally s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling by airport security and how many things had been deliber@@ ately done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a surprise that people who were most s@@ mu@@ g@@ ly s@@ mu@@ g@@ ly or in@@ know@@ ingly - by security , those who were most frequently flying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the company indicates that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people are often uncertain about what liquids they are allowed or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the biggest amount of the objects prohibited by the T@@ SA are forbidden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a time , the people thought the T@@ SA could view books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ our@@ ware . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
liquids are permitted on domestic flights but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel Order
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; electro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k gives a huge number of pre@@ ferences for his new Tesla &quot; Model 3 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , he has always sm@@ ashed that a part of the clients has already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the always triumph@@ ant numbers on sales increase and even giant sales targets , Tesla @-@ boss El@@ on Mus@@ k will reveal another , less striking numbers : the cancellations made during the new mass market model 3 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past few months , Mus@@ k frequently had applied more than 500.000 openings for the new car , which are just beginning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , Mus@@ k is dre@@ aming of a total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 6@@ 3.000 have already been withdrawn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
critics always noted that it is merely a non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a cancellation of Tesla the 1000 Euro ( in the USA , 1000 US dollars and in Great Britain , 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at present , 45@@ ,000 of these non @-@ binding reservations are available in a telephone conference with analysts at a telephone conference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the cancellation of up to 12 per cent of all orders should be solved , however , the Tesla boss does not believe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
its argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not on demand but on the production side .
in the past year Tesla 8@@ 4.000 cars delivered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2018 it should be assembled - all models have been put together - 500,000 in 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
the Mus@@ k currently comes up to 1800 reservations per day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who today ordered a &quot; Model 3 &quot; can be expected in the second half of 2018 - when Tesla creates , his brand new , never even in the practice of tested production lines without any bigger breaks with maximum load . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if it comes to larger delays , then the requ@@ ility of reservations could be used for Tesla . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for then , the company cannot stop satisfied customers , run in dro@@ ves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not mention the complaint , which was raised against his previous job in a German labour court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a deadline that ran for States on October 1 , to comply with the 2015 standards for under@@ taking ozone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt announced that he was delayed by spending a year in order to study more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; in local decisions or to im@@ pe@@ de economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , accused of his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump on the Prosecutor of Ok@@ la@@ homa , was long time a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt is repeated to block or delay regul@@ ating the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sudden return from Wednesday is the recent legal back @-@ back relief for the P@@ ru@@ itts regulatory shut@@ down agenda .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month , a German Federal Constitutional Court decided that the EPA se@@ wage has exceeded its authority as he tried to undertake the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies for monitoring and reduction of meth@@ anol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that his revers@@ al of the EPA for cooperation with the states by the complex process of timely release of the new standards ampli@@ fied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under former management , EPA often used the dead@@ lines for carrying out and then waited to be accused of activ@@ ating activists and others , and said P@@ ru@@ itt , who testi@@ fied more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by judicial proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority that gives us , seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the EPA comments said that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually make its &quot; powers to delay and all other legally available to ensure that the rules are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Republi@@ can push in Congress to a wider re @-@ setting of the ozone rules .
a bill to be approved in the last month &apos;s draft is to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet set up in the Senate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the New York @-@ General At@@ tor@@ ney , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who directed the EPA in this week , said the Group intend to maintain the statutory pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our collagen - is an important profit for health and safety of these 6.7 million New York , which are directly affected by the Smo@@ g , who streams in their communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new York in this case in California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ y@@ van@@ ic , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ground @-@ Oz@@ on arises when poll@@ utants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups , and every year can contribute to thousands of premature deaths . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
representatives of public health care and environmental conserv@@ ation@@ es che@@ ered about P@@ ru@@ pp &apos;s surprising changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s worried how much pressure it takes to breathe this reasonable step by the responsible for the protection of the air that we inhal@@ e , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we must continue to fight against the ide@@ ological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to stop environmental contam@@ in@@ ants and their special interests . &quot;
Tum@@ my celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ Church is invited to the old cemetery @-@ area in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday 16 July at 16.@@ 30 to a Ser@@ en@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village is the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant a popular place to stay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the visitors of the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted from this powerful place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the salvation and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and supporters of the tum@@ ours of their concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Walter Martini says : &quot; it is a unique Northern treasure . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 12@@ 67 , St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle had been mentioned in documents in the Württem@@ bür@@ g@@ ischer Garten , &quot; Count Hermann von Sul@@ z &quot; sold the mountain to a Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the wording of the document , the tum@@ bling mountain apart from the former parish church also belonged to the church or the patron of the patron and not the vice versa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there were people there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as from the description of the Upper Freu@@ den@@ stadt in 1858 , next to the village and the Ober@@ dorf , which today is still visible in the village of Tum@@ am , the &quot; Berg &quot; of the village . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
old maps from the period around the year 1600 under@@ pin the historical conditions .
the Pat@@ ron@@ al law came out of the early medieval times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Lord that built a church , and occupied with a pastor , remained in the owner of this church and could even inherit these pec@@ uli@@ arities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the right to use a pastor or bishop asked a new priest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells in the tower .
the bigger of the two car@@ vings on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell rang the first time in 16@@ 92 and had to be released in 1942 in the Second World War .
during the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows of the windows were stolen and the parts are stolen .
the roof was le@@ aky .
in 17@@ 96 French troops were en@@ camped near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809 .
until 1869 the tum@@ our Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead in horns .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demolished .
only the church tower was left standing .
in the New Year in 18@@ 34 a storm moved the church tower and half pl@@ ung@@ ed .
in order to prevent mis@@ fortune the tower was canc@@ eled .
only today still existing Tur@@ m@@ z@@ hi@@ g remained as a witness to the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em , worked by the &quot; Schaff@@ hausen Pen@@ sion@@ ers &quot; as a successor by Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as organis@@ er , friends and Pat@@ rons invite tum@@ ors on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth day of Ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery on St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is designed by the Ke@@ pler Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with the contribut@@ or by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Reinhold Matt@@ e@@ is .
local Hartmut Rom@@ ann talks the closing word .
the program starts at 16.@@ 30 .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 .
a um@@ trunk takes place in front of the cemetery for the conclusion of the Ser@@ en@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; the organizers represent the fantastic view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade only takes place in dry weather .
the organizers hope for many supporters for the maintenance of the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant which is of significance for tum@@ ours and of listening .
friends and Pat@@ rons of tum@@ ours are particularly committed to home care as Ser@@ en@@ ade @-@ organis@@ er Walter Martini .
association wants to check permission of wind wheels
&quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim is denied &quot; no legal pre@@ condition for the construction and has thus turned towards the council .
the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim we@@ aves &quot; has urged the Council of Andrew Co@@ enen ( CDU ) to withdraw its approval for the creation of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
it is illegal and un@@ lawful .
the association ar@@ gued that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 no wind turbines could have been approved at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette on the border of Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal to a wind power concentration zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines is basically possible at the same time , the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy use to the rest of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
such zones should avoid &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , which had not approved the district government in Düsseldorf , because of a revolution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning the author@@ is@@ tical requirement of approval , the pres@@ umed appro@@ vals is illegal and therefore rejected , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , President of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; denied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current state of things : the Municipal Council again decided the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , an approval of the district government is still standing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; in this place the issu@@ ance of approval for the establishment of wind turbines is not excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of an invitation .
&quot; the corresponding writing has been received since last week at the circle of square , &quot; declared a speaker .
the circle takes it the occasion to check the matter once again .
but it is not likely to do that the procedure will be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administ@@ rative Court , the circle on Thursday didn &apos;t want to express their content in the argument of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette construction of four meters high wind wheels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already last year , the company has participated in which the city of Vier@@ ses is medi@@ able , P@@ acht@@ agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land was closed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity need to be covered by approximately 11 400 households - this is equivalent to one @-@ fifth of the energy needs of all four @-@ day households . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last summer , the green light gave the green light for buying three wind turbines in the wind farm Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen , as well as a part in the district of Hein@@ sberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
car and tractor cra@@ bs together : woman dies in terrible accident
one aw@@ ful traffic accident has occurred on Friday morning at 10@@ am at the L 333 between the Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn district ) .
a woman was killed in killing .
two more persons were slightly injured .
the state road remained closed for hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following police officer , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch accompanied their passenger car with their 53 year old mother considered a companion for the L 333 in the direction of Bo@@ gel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
town and merchants plan &quot; home shopping &quot; -@@ weekend
bad Langen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and humans from the region are to re@@ discover the shops in the city centre in September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the commercial club and the municipal government will take advantage of the weekend on 8 and 9 September , to l@@ ure the inhabitants for shopping in downtown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the President of the Trade Association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; Home @-@ Shopp@@ en &quot; weekend aims to raise awareness of its own city away from the usual supermarket product . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to planned , a market with regional suppliers , similar to the weekly market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
domestic companies should also present themselves with their training places .
the shops of the city centre are also to be shipped to the &quot; midnight shopping . &quot;
the action is not just for residents of the city and the nearby region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in preparation , commerci@@ als in radio , an internet video and printed bag that refer to the action weekend , Christian König . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the City Administration and Trade Association collabor@@ ate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
so the industrial society and the city go into a further stage of the project &quot; Attra@@ ctive downtown . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this includes new promotions as the first &quot; Active Tag &quot; for Brun@@ nen@@ fest , with a sold @-@ out Sunday , talks with all tra@@ ilers and hosts to move them for active participation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
customer potential can also be re @-@ opened or re @-@ opened .
this includes courses and tourists .
but many locals also had lost the city centre while shopping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , all of them would need to anim@@ ate the city center - to hire in the owner of the whole city and clubs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was to overcome with a network to overcome the Le@@ th@@ arg@@ y , which partly has spread , king in the spring . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Birgit Stre@@ ich , head of the I@@ HK Center in Mü@@ hl@@ hausen , shared the first three &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day for the first time five Thur@@ ing@@ ia towns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to Bad Langen@@ sal@@ za this Weimar is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and Blei@@ cher@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the day sol@@ le &quot; for the appreciation of local trade and its significance for the community of our cities stronger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action of spring ends of the Chamber of Commerce and many partners make it clear that every citizen can influence its purchase behaviour himself .

Tr@@ ump put after continuous tran@@ scription of call to Mexico under pressure because of payment of the border wall
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tran@@ scription of phone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump , and leaders of Mexico and Australia were released by Washington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 27th January , Tr@@ ump called for a phone with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to , to tell you public that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US president compla@@ ined him because he den@@ ounced the wall , and said to him , &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to establish a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ ware , Mexico to pay for the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tran@@ scription of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turn@@ halle were also published and served a well @-@ called exchange .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ halle , that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia , would take over him &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid . &quot; after he had proposed a ban of res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ halle , &quot; this is the most unpleasant call for all the day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford massac@@ res : activists perform rac@@ ist ly@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an 1948 @-@ he Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators at the rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and came to the Ford Bridge of Moore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , a group of white men replaced with rif@@ les to block his way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leader of Mob@@ s - a man of middle age in a con@@ i@@ fer , took a long train on his cig@@ ar and looked again by the wind@@ shield . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
inside the in@@ mates the in@@ mates in fear .
&quot; we want this n - --- r Roger ! &quot; bre@@ ws the man .
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
cri@@ es out of the silence as a young black man from the passenger seat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck@@ ily this horrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is only a desc@@ endant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger &quot; , almost all of them were in the audience a very real epidemic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2005 , citizens come back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge , in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , as well as George and Mae Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey in 1946 came out in 1946 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no one was ever charged with murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really un@@ predic@@ table that no single person was arrested in all these years - although we know who they are , &quot; Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps the organisation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a history but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year old former congress of the state of Georgia and a life @-@ long citizen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a dra@@ mati@@ st call for action serves as a dra@@ mati@@ st call for action and represents an annual memory of the mon@@ ro@@ e community , that it has never been corrected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to persecu@@ te , we want healing , we want healing , but first we have received justice , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot get healing and reconciliation , until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a ba@@ er puts a sheet of sheets on the body of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to FBI files , which were received by N@@ BC news , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but nobody was ever charged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the susp@@ ects remain on the open for decades , Citi@@ zenship said that the double motivation for Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city was always known : Politics and Sex . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in April 1946 , a decision adopted by the Supreme Court of Justice in Georgia for the first time to vote their vote in the summer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at about the same time , according to the FBI , the FBI &apos; Black Far@@ mp@@ ant Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , down during a fight - supposedly because of a woman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Broo@@ ks told her that H@@ ester was s@@ laugh@@ tered with Mal@@ com@@ s &apos;s wife Dor@@ othy and she gave birth to her husband , not belonging to her husband . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars , paid tribute to Mal@@ com out of the prison , the FBI . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cou@@ sins Mae Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to jail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when she removed from prison , the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge approached , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b drew the car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , Harrison , which has been prepared and arranged the mur@@ ders , &quot; conclu@@ des a FBI report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a plot between the state and local prosecution , which had not only been involved in the murder , evidence and identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks releases it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was a electoral law massacre . &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you don &apos;t agree , then you will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their presentation is graphic , stra@@ pping and is justified in a way of deep racism , of which many believe that he does not exist in America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to watch , and even more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that it is the point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch because we are confron@@ ted with his ugly in us all , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to it or listen to what I did through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen White and the remainder black - as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene co @-@ director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has played the role of the leader C@@ lan@@ co , but he said he will never be easier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story in life , because we don &apos;t want to return to those days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ con@@ a did the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester to play their lines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the piece starts with Mal@@ com , who cri@@ es the test@@ es and har@@ assed it , angry that he has slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; --- he , wa@@ sted off my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ con@@ a resist@@ ed the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone breaks ( at least every black actor ) into laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; I asked Ras@@ con@@ a .
he is al@@ ar@@ ming and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no &quot; he said Gre@@ ene , still ch@@ u@@ ck@@ ling .
&quot; I simply do not believe that white people at that time &quot; n --- he &quot; said . &quot;
&quot; but &quot; and wit@@ es one of the other black ones .
&quot; you only have to meet the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and exactly there the energy moves in the room ; a sense of camera union replaces the dis@@ comfort .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone is busy with this , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the scene starts once again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this time , when Ras@@ con@@ a says the N word , he says it sharply and with im@@ print . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
absolutely nobody laughs .
this repeti@@ tion is violent and fast .
there are fri@@ ght , kis@@ ses and then silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman clothed with a mourning , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and introduces cheap holidays trau@@ ma &quot; St@@ range Fru@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks in every second word .
about a hundred metres behind it a group of about four dozen people wi@@ pes away sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is divided evenly between black and white .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a pair is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to view the performance , many come down only the road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they lived for nearly eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as pressing humidity when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the grav@@ estones of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to this point , the mor@@ de has remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now if one finds in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de took place , the aerial is felt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and to insp@@ ect the body name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are sitting on their heads , register the f@@ ake blood and the breast and whis@@ per@@ ing one another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she mur@@ mu@@ red a little boy , as if he would remember . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after several minutes , Gre@@ ene the crowd and suddenly it is over . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch and wi@@ pe her tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gged Mar@@ bau@@ gh the man in the suit who played the cello member .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nick Ras@@ con@@ a embra@@ ces two of his players and then she we@@ eping in her arms , the emotional bur@@ dens of the performance breaks through him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; whis@@ ks one of the women .
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
you did that for a reason . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , the audience puts together with the actors together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a table ch@@ atting a white pair of Atlanta , excited about the order with a black couple that they have just met . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski went to find words , which felt the performance left . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to hear these horrible words and deeds ... by people who look like yourself and do this , because they look like it , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what that really does with me will believe me that the Lyn@@ ch is still going on , &quot; she added , &quot; today it is called the police slide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone broo@@ ks at his table , he eats and rec@@ alls the civil rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , he started planning the performance next year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the adjustment is inspiring , because it describes the horror of what we bear , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he who did not study his own story , does not know his own story , is do@@ omed to repeat them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Arma@@ ged@@ don &quot; reconc@@ ile the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s mon@@ umental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf is set up on a colourful , six @-@ story scenery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bu@@ oy@@ ancy ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows a sh@@ red@@ ded street corner with the rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from East German times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before , an open Mercedes classic car , posing in whom the Rh@@ en@@ ders are more posi@@ eren , or alternatively a Is@@ etta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
stacked oil cas@@ ks remember Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ moti@@ v - Money , Power and Gi@@ er - moves through his &quot; ring &quot; production .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three Rhein@@ lights - sung by Stephanie Hou@@ ses , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmonious as in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
k@@ ess Sieg@@ fried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) in Hollywood @-@ Man@@ ier leads a glue into the trunk and give the cra@@ zi@@ o Cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing sings the glorious daughter Hagen that surrounds the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ ers .
brutal the scene as he saw Sieg@@ fried .
later Gun@@ ther also has to believe ( Markus oak ) .
the audience thanks it to the ensemble with strong appl@@ ause .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who is very humble and ten@@ dered his hands on the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; big appl@@ ause is for the festival orchestra which shows itself on stage for the first time , in view of the big heat again in le@@ aking leisure clothes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the appearance was expected by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of Regi@@ ons with excitement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , he still had to climb a whi@@ p of the pipe concert for five years later , in which the &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; calls went down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is expected to look forward to this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you noticed that the audience has grown together with the &quot; Ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it is also an understanding of his sight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I draw a positive conclusion .
max Works as a volunteer
they work at several locations in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quantity : normally in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture exchange , once a week I help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I have also worked in the open @-@ day at school .
how are your experiences with it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amount : it &apos;s a nice , wide spectrum that I see here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they are 26 years old and a late professional volunteer .
how does it come from ?
amount : I did my high school .
and then a civil engineering study we say once again successfully canc@@ eled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I recognized that it is wrong for me , and I want to do something else with people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then I asked what are you doing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make a social year , there &apos;s a gli@@ mpse that you can see as it is in the focal point , perhaps also , really . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and was it so ?
amount : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the winter term in the winter term .
I will study dual in the ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne is a social worker education and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer ?
amount : yes , it is very variable .
it always comes to where you can be FS@@ J .
one can make it from the old house to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
for me it was very varied .
I was partly in the O@@ gs , so in the afternoon support .
it was the right thing for me that has mat@@ ured me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs .
unlike in construction engineers ?
amount : well clear , here it is not about to reck@@ on stil@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you always have other people in front of men , each having a completely different story behind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether a refugee has been taken out of the family , you always have to respond individually . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very interesting .
and you had no reservation ?
a lot : I am not the guy .
it is a section which gives a lot .
a lot of love , lots of kindness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are also negative moments , but it is life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ear@@ son covers more 3,000 jobs and over@@ threw the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the British educational group P@@ ear@@ son said to sh@@ orten some 3,000 jobs and sh@@ orten its interim dividend to reduce the pressure in order to overcome the pressure with which the company is confron@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the job reduction , managing director John Fall@@ on predominantly for late 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , which has already lost 4,000 positions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ear@@ son announced in May in a third cost programme to cost savings of more 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to recover a shop , which was taken by the rapid pace of digital learning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company , which , last month , expressed his participation in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House on the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , after an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kon@@ vo@@ i attack by Kabul : NATO soldier killed in suicide attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a military con@@ voy has attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afghan capital Kabul , killed one soldier of NATO and killed several other people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; five soldiers and an interpre@@ ters were viol@@ ated , divided by Nato members . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in@@ confirmed local reports report@@ edly died in the incident at Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h in three civilians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bombing has the last violence that has taken Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday , more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ bed killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement of Nato , the explosion on Thursday evening had to be done when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army has been attacked by a &quot; supervised explosive &quot; explo@@ sives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the testimony states that all the injured in a stable state are , and in the US military hospital on the B@@ agram . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , which is known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops at the nearby B@@ agram . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the United Nations estimates , at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , roughly 20 % of them in the capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of July , suicide of at least 30 people killed in a largely rail district in Kabul . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Taliban said they had done this attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on May 31 , a huge bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city was killed more than 150 people with the deadly milit@@ ant attack in the country , since the Taliban kic@@ ked off the power of power in 2001 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence covers the pre@@ occupation security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Tr@@ ump was weighing , increasing the number of U.S. forces , military and police in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; correspon@@ dents say that the suicide attacks in Kabul in Kabul has also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policy and in particular in the reputation of President Ash@@ raf G@@ hani . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
EPA the decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to K@@ lay around
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US @-@ American Environmental Protection Agency has taken a decision to susp@@ end the government of Obama , after which the states required to susp@@ ect the Smo@@ g @-@ induced emissions . this was a day after 15 states accused the agency due to step@@ ping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday to drive the so @-@ called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ Rules 2015 , &quot; and said they show the commitment of the agency , together with states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we react to our government partners , &quot; said EPA @-@ boss Scott P@@ ru@@ ff in a declaration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt announced the intention of EPA to determine the ozone provisions which must be made in a part of the country poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions - in order to delay more str@@ ingent air quality standards - in order to delay more str@@ ingent emissions standards - by October 2018 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the District of Colombia , filed a complaint on Tuesday , and said that the effort was illegal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump tried to raise a wide range of environmental impacts on the former president Barack Obama , as part of a bro@@ ader agenda that should boost economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have caused the back of the Democrats and conservation groups that wor@@ ries about the effects of larger emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA website says that the inhal@@ ation of air , the ozone layer contains &quot; the lung function and the respiratory symptoms can increase , &quot; as as@@ thma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
community wants common room
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end , the decision was clear : with two counter@@ parts , the municipal council decided to establish a community living space in the future of the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prior to discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the missing basic piece is signed , says Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ ad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it will still take time until the church belonging to the church is owned , but there is no planning to do that from a private investor to the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a discussion about a common space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the two investors , which are still in the boat , offered to meet the congregation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the ground floor he would make a living space - around 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with an area of 70 square meters of space available for a special price .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administration and the majority of the municipal council , in front of such a common room not just as a meeting place for the residents of sen@@ i@@ or@@ derly residential , but open to the church . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an example the word made the &quot; kn@@ it Cafe &quot; for the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision , which has been decided by pro@@ vision@@ ing the ongoing household , is already decided by conveying possibilities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the construction is located in the refurb@@ ishment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the establishment of a common area would be T@@ j@@ ade , with 60 percent produced by 30 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision sees to sign@@ alize the investor , that in this respect you don &apos;t want to throw a b@@ ill@@ ary between the legs - as well as po@@ unding roof , which makes it more efficient - as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; need@@ less , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , be this supplement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when it helps : unanim@@ ously passes the panel .
not so easy it goes to the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s call refers to the many buildings that I don &apos;t get so well ahead , so they rest in the common room out of the window , says : &quot; I do so hard with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ der definitely speaks for the common room - but absolutely against municipal involvement .
it sees behind it a hidden sub @-@ prevention to any foreign investors or even foreign investors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not what you don &apos;t do so , because with the purchase of the area you don &apos;t give a subsi@@ dy , but I get a genuine , in a doubt , is the counter @-@ speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sta@@ ig@@ ers application to ple@@ ad the decisions accordingly . there are three advoc@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two oppos@@ ites in the original program , which Stefan H@@ aller summar@@ ises : &quot; when we summar@@ ize the decision , we make a huge step into our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Police ha@@ sted , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Langen@@ felder was on the road by 12.@@ 20 with his bike on the bike trail of the Schwar@@ zer road towards Hil@@ den . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Senior Ci@@ tizens wanted to cross the road@@ way on the road to the Buch@@ hol@@ zer bush .
a passenger car driver gave him a priority in the same direction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the Langen@@ thal drove onto the road , he obviously didn &apos;t b@@ other on the other hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

FC Bayern Munich must refra@@ in from Super@@ cup against Bor@@ us@@ sia in Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup is held without him : David Al@@ aba does not have to sau@@ lt the game against Dortmund .
FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first mandatory race of the new season .
seven Pro@@ s are missing the defender of the Super@@ cup in the Super@@ cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personnel won at the German Football record champion Bayern Munich before the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Po@@ kal@@ zi@@ eger Bor@@ us@@ sia , Dortmund always bigger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must refra@@ in from the Bv@@ M on David Al@@ aba .
the Italian confirmed the Italian .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; additionally the Mün@@ ch@@ ers Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the five defe@@ ats in the past six review , An@@ cel@@ otti did the physical condition and lack of balance in the game of his team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was last not good . &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official account of the season .
&quot; football is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is a very difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Du@@ el of the two German Football heav@@ y@@ weights is moving the fans in their spell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the game is sold with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 viewers , distributed the German football league ( DF@@ L ) on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Harz Mountains from Star to Star
the first &quot; star path &quot; should evol@@ ve in the resin .
this plan is the association Stern@@ warte St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet away in Göttingen - since 2003 .
a &quot; star trail &quot; met the need of many Har@@ z@@ visits to the patient &apos;s need .
it combines nature , science , movement and sporting performance .
the members want to establish on the planned route boards and inform them about stars and stars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase to 2018 , the club plans to reach highly visible installations from five to six locations &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
In@@ quiry branches St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on boards should be supplemented by Internet .
therefore a good mobile network reception plays a role in the location selection .
also acces@@ sibility is a crit@@ eri@@ on .
later the star section will be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star@@ path , the viewer experience much worth knowing , for example about physics of the individual stars , &quot; said the club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , they lear@@ nt why stars could have different colors or why a star ru@@ ined more than another , although he is much further away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , in which constellation is a selected star , and when he is best to see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg as the highest located ob@@ servatory in Northern Germany since 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Federal Office for nature conservation , the site in the middle of the national park ranks among the six dar@@ k@@ est regions in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way galaxy and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galaxy were clearly seen with naked eye .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2003 , there has been something similar to the promotion of the promotion of Planet@@ arium Göttingen as the planned star@@ base - the planet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
beginning of Geb@@ har@@ ds hotel in the Go@@ e@@ the@@ alle@@ e which forms the interior of our solar system the planet is leading up to the Ha@@ in@@ berg and to the ob@@ servatory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( commune Gli@@ de ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf planet de@@ mot@@ ed plug@@ in , are placed exact at the distance and scale of one to two billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meter diameter , while the sun weighs 70 meters away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire distance from the planet is a good four kilometres .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the light takes about eight hours , pede@@ stri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pede@@ stri@@ ans are quicker than light in the universe .
the march to the next fixing star but would last half a year .
Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and V@@ asy@@ l Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o meet for the first time in discussing a possible show@@ down
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ asy@@ l Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia , who in a collision course should be staged in a collision course in the near future , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the Un@@ proposed World Boxing Council Ligh@@ weight Champion , the corridor down to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o , the World Boxing Organisation Super @-@ Spring Champion Stal@@ lion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory by unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions Adri@@ en Bron@@ der on Saturday , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und &apos;s list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia put forth the right hand , and said , &quot; How are you the champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 19 o &apos;clock on ES@@ PN .
as the couple for photos posed Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Cli@@ mas realized that a possible show@@ down between the fighters that would be the perfect order .
&quot; I am a former spring weight . &quot; re@@ minded Gar@@ cia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I grew up for the bronze &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to run light weight .
and he must move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
the fans ask for this .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o voted .
&quot; boxing needs this struggle . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kli@@ mas asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that will fight Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o with a 135 @-@ pound debut at the end of the last summer with Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to join the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell , after its light weight title in the Forum on September 23 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this battle could take place in the pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans have asked for him , &quot; said Gar@@ cia , and later pressed out to fight against the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can produce this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said he was treasure Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may be able to participate in his Saturday battle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o held with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he think the Trinity Champion from River@@ side looks very slowly but I &apos;m sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted me the Ko @-@ Out . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said that the focus is to show impact strength , then boxing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they both said , and could feel the Mom@@ entum that had built up for their own struggle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is the fight which must be carried out .
no other struggle creates so much attention and excitement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work , &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o said : &quot; I waited to the top fighters and this is Mik@@ ey .
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four injured to tyre plat@@ ters
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at an accident on the A7 , four people were injured on Thursday afternoon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following the first information , the driver lost a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira at 16.@@ 30 shortly before the front line , presumably after a tyre plat@@ el@@ zer that controls over his vehicle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the car threw the right into the bows , where he over@@ threw himself and then remained on the roof in the green strip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children , were severely injured in the accident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the initial supply of the injured service , the A7 in the direction north for about an hour was closed , and traffic on the left side could pass by accident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fort@@ un@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; turning chain works better &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Andre Hoffmann appears after 2 : 2 at the end of the season , to Braunschweig that optimi@@ zing the def@@ ensive information in Au@@ e points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the first season open@@ er , Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the outcome , because there would be no two opponents at 2 : 2 against Br@@ uns@@ wick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to watch in Au@@ e even better , &quot; says the def@@ ensive player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Erz@@ gebirge the shooting string is to be optimized even further .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there is no longer a gate after a stum@@ bling block , or even more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , there will be no more than Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) to the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better right after the experience in preparation with the shooting chain , than with the quad@@ rup@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yet I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann appears to have on the se@@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko G@@ ie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a requirement is that we are still better harmon@@ izing and we don &apos;t afford to do so many play@@ able errors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann also drives to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if one cannot speak after a mis@@ sal of a mis@@ sive start , I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could be quite okay . &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we stand on Sunday with four points and can focus on the trop@@ hy on Sunday we will certainly speak of a decent season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer wanted nothing to know about that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start into the season was only after six to eight days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled due to a bad weather . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can begin the season quasi with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann said that the players from Au@@ e might have something fresh , as they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a ascension into the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they do not know so 100 % wherever they stand , &quot; says the def@@ ending of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the guest house from the Rhin@@ eland will go as a light favourite on Sunday , at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we take them away , just because we have the claim to come under the first six , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance sheet is quite positive for Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no crew in the second Bundesliga , which one has to beat from the out@@ set , &quot; explains Fort@@ un@@ as Head coach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot;
and so funk@@ el will not experience his players on Sunday in any case .
new results of the Swedish Asyl@@ um review tests published
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recent findings of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which have been subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their ages , showed that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swedish Authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( ri@@ p@@ c@@ et ) has begun with execution of tests last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should be more closely involved during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish Migration Authority ( Mig@@ rant en@@ et ) due to errors during the evaluation of the correct age of some refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to now , Mig@@ rant has sent 6.@@ 880 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests between mid @-@ March until 31 July 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were evaluated as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency issued that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion was that the person is &quot; possibly under 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tests will only be conducted in cases where the age of the person is ques@@ tioned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Johan G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent with the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the figures are fairly constant , &quot; said the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the high proportion of cases , in which the person has been evaluated than over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers has lied over his age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 cases , suggest@@ ing that the person was 18 years or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska Dag@@ bla@@ det out the 5@@ 81 results published , it turned out that in 243 these cases the person had said that she will be 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the method of medical age assessment , in x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI recordings are analysed , which then are cri@@ tici@@ zed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a scep@@ tic is the En@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus des Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska @-@ Institute , whose work includes the evaluation of biological friction of people to see whether it sooner or later than usually passed by pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the kind of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to assess the biological age in this way is very uns@@ af@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot say it certainly , we should not do as if we could , &quot; he said the Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk , a child as an adult is minimal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in the Plan
the work on the three bridges of the District Road 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ra@@ mberg are progres@@ sing well .
a seven tons of heavy emphasis was installed on Wednesday at the east entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good in time , it runs super , &quot; says Reinhold Lei@@ cht , Construction Manager at the Department of For@@ ms and Traffic in the governing board of Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the works began in April at the same time at all three rest@@ or@@ atory bridges between Sch@@ ra@@ mberg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the building is fore@@ seen for October , and Lei@@ cht is sure that the timet@@ able is kept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first bridge to come from Sch@@ ra@@ mberg is leading to Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ ault bridge made of concrete that is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in the year 1900 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the two other bridges , she has now come into the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to ensure stability and safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the other two bridges lead across the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two were built in 1939 , and are twelve , and 10,@@ 60 metres long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bridge at the village of Lau@@ ter@@ bach , on Wednesday morning , has a 1,@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons heavy @-@ called bridge cap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a mar@@ ginal attachment that is also used as an operating way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , on Friday a 2.@@ 20 meter wide range of bridge should be inserted on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the pedestrian walk@@ way should go .
this is what it is about finished parts is a patent for the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already provided with the patented bridge caps .
a special finger @-@ feeling has to put the laying of lines by the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is a glass fibre cable connected to which many companies can be connected .
local residents were informed in advance of the work by hand fl@@ yers .
fish and cru@@ st@@ ac@@ eans had to be fl@@ amed first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the bridges between the building farm building and the gathering in the direction of Sch@@ ra@@ mberg , the traffic is regulated by a traffic light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the construction work on Lau@@ ter@@ bacher village , the road is in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the three deposits are approx . 700 000 Euros .
the whole is financed by the country .
AF@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ lower protest with German potato salad
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it does not occur so often that parties in a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , comes together , what else is difficult for taking a hat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Socialist party represented in the cra@@ yon of volcanic erup@@ tion parties ( CDU , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad alliance , because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ dell has become a loud poster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and known names of the start - as Alice Wei@@ der , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land will form the leading duo for the German Bundestag on September 24 , and the Deputy Chairman of the Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but those who already are hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ collectors , but demonstrate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the motto &quot; The Eifel is colorful . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally the city @-@ picnic under the slogan &quot; All on a table &quot; is planned at the fountain , but is now taking place in the parking lot below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and right in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a colourful picture that is offered here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chairman of the Forums A World and one of the relevant organis@@ ers , are pleased : &quot; great , how many people have come together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; original German potato salad which could eat also the Af@@ D without any problem , &quot; says the woman who has brought him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police rans@@ acked many officers to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence primarily on the railway station , which is only a few meters away from the venues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mario Hom@@ es reported from the Af@@ D volcanic erup@@ tion , he tried to get such an event and get the supplement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ sdorf was in demand in Dau@@ n initially , but there was not enough parking because of the already built Lau@@ ren@@ ti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ es is pleased that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; overlooking the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz , he says : &quot; that &apos;s the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also does : at the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz there is a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle various speakers , among them the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D @-@ Chair@@ woman Uwe Young . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the hall , approximately 200 listen@@ ers are waiting that the top candidate for the Bun@@ dest@@ al code , Alice Wei@@ der , and the Deputy Chairman of the Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch will hold their speech@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unchanged is the police presence but so far the officers had a quiet evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little more than an hour takes the Af@@ D event , the guests on the court have a longer breath , but also there is a long stay there after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police can press release - no special inci@@ dents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a re @-@ hear by the Wolf@@ ho@@ ists Freder@@ ic B@@ elli in the series Has@@ la@@ cher &apos;s monastery concerts tomorrow morning to Sunday at 20 o &apos;clock in the monastery church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with the Bulgarian trumpet Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea , &quot; or even &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ fol@@ klore &quot; meets classic German training with roots in brass music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both sol@@ o@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held sol@@ opo@@ si@@ tions in Europe &apos;s leading orchest@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the renowned concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both combine the desire to not only exceed the borders on their instruments , but also to merge the borders of various gen@@ res . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in such a new look , Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new look , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &apos; world music &quot; united with Bulgarian fol@@ klore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; by jazz and free games to an intri@@ gu@@ ing total work of art . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this core of the programme was first performed in Freiburg in the first half of this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the renowned Compos@@ er N@@ ils W@@ ish has written specifically for the two musicians , and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher monastery church with its special acousti@@ cs is consci@@ ously included in the concert . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kri@@ sten Stewart talks about their bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
but I would like to try everything &quot; so Kri@@ sten Stewart totally open over its bis@@ ex@@ ual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I get into grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the probably best known relationship of Hollywood star@@ stars was the twi@@ light &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson that ultimately took bitter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite all , the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ erin is insured against the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love with anyone who I have lost . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think about , I would have played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten gave birth to be bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed the du@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered me .
I just liked it not to be taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; particularly underneath , she suffered from &quot; Bang Show@@ biz &quot; but in school time when they prefer to dress as a Bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really hurt me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I eleven I told me the children , I would look like a book . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt really attacked and fri@@ ghtened and damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &apos; girls , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially the public , they don &apos;t like to explain their love life : &quot; people expect you in a certain way and anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me a few , but I don &apos;t like to jus@@ tify myself from the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tr@@ ump , that he will change the party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; says Governor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayer and lots of thinking ... today , I will not help you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I cannot help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally was broken in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a trainer , I would say that it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before a big announcement at West Virginia Rally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice does not dis@@ approval the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Justice , who is according to For@@ bes of the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
For@@ bes will establish that he has under@@ mine coal mines in five states and he inherited from his father a carbohydr@@ ate store .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee held a declaration in which it said : &quot; the party exchange of Governor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party that would rather hin@@ der ourselves as it would be great to make our country magnificent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 govern@@ ors and control of least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last re@@ jection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership , &quot; said the R@@ NC Mc@@ Daniel in a declaration to the C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Co@@ e pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian exc@@ use for d@@ oping sc@@ andal
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world @-@ wide boss of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , comm@@ enting on Thursday what he did as an expert exc@@ use from Russia to a d@@ oping sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be absorbed into the sport again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russia &apos;s World Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the World Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships on the eve of the sport and that he was decided to fight d@@ oping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; all athletes who were s@@ apped out at competitions gold and silver medals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) was found on state @-@ funded D@@ oping in Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the Rep@@ orters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the whole Congress were glad that the Russian Federation has witnessed that they have experienced some pretty hot times , and all possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said he was &quot; pleased , &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for re@@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force , that this was not the moment to re @-@ use Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the principle of principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; added &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will start at the Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships , which begin Friday in London , start the rig@@ orous IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said that Russia still said some of the criteria for a recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug tests are still insufficient and forbidden in@@ ers are still free , he said Rep@@ orters in London according to a talk at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a fun@@ eral for Mali crashed into Mali
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during a fun@@ eral service in the North @-@ Hes@@ sian F@@ ritz@@ lar , some 1,000 people were thinking of the two soldiers with a helicopter crash in Mali . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the city town under high safety precau@@ tions .
the Minister Ursula of the Le@@ yen ( CDU ) told no matter to clari@@ fy the revolution .
they marked the two reverse pilots but as &quot; ön@@ ner of their trade . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow before this highest sacrifice , which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year old staff of Nord@@ h@@ essen had come alive on Wednesday a week in West African Mali .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their s@@ ali@@ ge were transferred to Germany and on Thursday , accompanied by a guard @-@ guard of the Bundes@@ wehr in the F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ er cathedral Saint Peter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only the family stayed in the church at noon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then the fun@@ eral celebration in the circle of the family , closest friends , from representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr , and politics began . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CDU ) and the chief designer of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grape harv@@ ested ro@@ ses , and their families stood by arm in the arm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of the church F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ er and a number of soldiers pursued the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ab@@ yen of Defense awarded the reverse soldiers as &quot; High@@ ly decorated , &quot; and sat@@ ined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rod captain had built up the flying ch@@ anc@@ ellor tiger in F@@ ritz@@ lar , and was one of the first six out of his regim@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volker Bau@@ er@@ sa@@ x , Commander of the Regim@@ ent to whom the soldiers belong , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If the occupation could not turn off the crash , there would have no thought . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
doubt about the UN mission in Mali was not used by the Le@@ yen : the commitment is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of high importance , &quot; for a country , from which we are only separated by two states , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the fun@@ eral service the sal@@ aries were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where to be buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not make any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want to use his wife right next to his wife
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man of the Danish queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that shared the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally the Danish royal couple is buried in the Church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for both of them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Queen was with her husband &apos;s decision , it was further told in the message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
where Prince Hen@@ rik was buried there is still un@@ clear .
but he did not intend to teach in his French homeland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a bid from it , that he was not happy with his title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the heir of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ a in 1972 , he would have become king . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 he went into retirement and also puts the title &quot; prin@@ cess@@ es . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Hen@@ rik in Denmark does not have the title and the function he wanted to see himself as equivalent to his wife , also not after death , LE@@ NE B@@ alle@@ by declared the chief spokes@@ woman of the Danish royal house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will be , be still un@@ clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he did not intend to teach in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he likes the land for which he worked for the last 50 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 1965 , the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French ari@@ stoc@@ rat , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French embassy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people were in@@ flo@@ ated , Prince Hen@@ rik in his barely 50 years old rule at the Dan@@ es had a heavy stand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a auto@@ biography about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my god was vibr@@ ating , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk cre@@ eks instead of kn@@ it@@ so@@ cks , Citro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , Tennis instead of soccer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ od that I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco and which in this country had the reputation to be the brand of soci@@ alistic intellec@@ tu@@ als , I couldn &apos;t hope . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed .
these were the same two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Weil want to re@@ election re@@ election
the CDU and the F@@ DP in front of a majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dutch Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is following the loss of red @-@ green government majority , but he doesn &apos;t want to re@@ tire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , the parliament elected the resolution of the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , the surprising outlet of a Gre@@ ens dep@@ u@@ ties in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; five months before the official date of the country @-@ election , the red @-@ green Coalition lost its scar@@ ce majority in the parliament by the CDU and F@@ DP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old Gre@@ ke T@@ v@@ ets , founded her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) in 2018 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I see my political future in the CDU , &quot; explained them on Friday in Hanover .
the CDU @-@ president Björ@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend it to his faction .
this would have 69 seats in the lower Sax@@ on land day for the SPD and the Green 68 seats .
so far the relationship was the way round .
the new Land@@ day will be selected as regular on 14 January .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said that the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether they could continue to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan Weil passed , however , that the Parliament will soon decide its self @-@ resolution as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CDU faction is expected to decide on Tuesday through her further procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state authority also sees the possibility that the Parliament will be reli@@ eved with the Prime Minister , confidence and cho@@ oses a successor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; our Constitution offers several options .
these options must be insp@@ ected legally clean &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said .
&quot; you will discuss any questions in peace if they are legally checked . &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; little cur@@ ius &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the politicians himself stressed : &quot; I &apos;m not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
they identified themselves as a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the ab@@ dic@@ ated dep@@ u@@ ties to return their country estate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we of course , of course , that she has received her country estate that will return on the green national list , with immediate effect , &quot; distributed the Landes@@ Chair@@ men Met@@ a Jans@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner with immediate effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the president of the Gre@@ ens Anja PI@@ EL said : &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests . &quot;
she deliber@@ ately decided to lead no foreign language into the faction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even before the background , there was no content differences , we cannot trace this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the survi@@ vors of the Lower Saxony @-@ ruling El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests to the CDU as betra@@ y@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conduct of the former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only the betra@@ y@@ al of the voters and voters , but also betra@@ y@@ al of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the S &amp; D vice @-@ president on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to re @-@ choose the Parliament &apos;s day .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CDU in Lower Saxony makes this dirty in@@ tri@@ dge game and tries to beat any political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CDU president Björ@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his dep@@ u@@ ties to include El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests in the CDU .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the President of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw T@@ v@@ ests , with a person@@ alised career the result of the 2013 Parliament election . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CDU , back then before the SPD , was the strongest force , the SPD and the Green had a very thin majority of a voice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agricultural ministers in an interview - How do we protect us from pois@@ ers , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany discussed about contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect itself .
agricultural Minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is an interview with the German editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and response .
Mr. Schmidt : how can consumers protect consumers from pois@@ oned eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage the consumer and consumers to watch the eggs in your fridge , and to check the st@@ amping press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bundes@@ länder published the latest information on the affected eggs @-@ Char@@ gen at the www.@@ c@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de consumer portal .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if after all we know , health haz@@ ards is practically excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now Al@@ di will take over the best possible crisis action - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance of the Federal Economic Defense Minister is not really perceived ?
the food monitoring is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless my house has immediately switched off , and since the acqua@@ int@@ ance of Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to the consumer .
trade has the same way for the manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are traffic @-@ capable and are harmless to health .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if due to eggs of the resi@@ dues content of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , these are non @-@ traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the un@@ loaded eggs can be sold and consumed .
this time are not the agriturismi to blame .
do production plants and consumers sit in the same boat ?
after the actual design the manufacturing company meets the direct debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather , they must reck@@ on due to alleged illegal practices of service companies with economic damages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as always there is little control in the harvest .
is there only personal responsibility missing or even to the conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
there were just the official controls which have exposed the process .
the truth also belongs to the fact that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded from 100 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is precisely why a consistent education of such events and hand@@ over to the treas@@ ury in the cases , in which criminal matters can be submitted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have made several times already , that I expect an additional information from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the regular alarm system really necessary in food industry ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers and consumers have the right to get safely and traffic @-@ enabled foods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers and consumers are right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the pan@@ eled means , manufacturers , dealers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically it must be clear : the lawful use of insec@@ ti@@ ti@@ zi@@ ds Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ safe animals is not removable and must be stopped immediately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has to be consistent across all planes and working with high pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expect from all the relevant authorities , that the atomic fact is correct and g@@ un@@ solved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how to influence the finance rules of walking on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s to Paris
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rules that aim to prevent un@@ hin@@ dered issues of European football matches will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEFA , as the leading organisation who monitors the European game has the power to forbi@@ d men from access to the prestigious champion League tournament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial Fair @-@ Play @-@ rules , which were sum@@ mon@@ ed in 2011 by UEFA EURO , means that PS@@ G has to re@@ prove that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar was financed without large losses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million dollar ) to get out of the Brazilian treaty , and N@@ ey@@ mar is receiving a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PS@@ G can easily get the money , so that N@@ ey@@ mar under@@ takes and bring him into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energy of rich rul@@ ings of Qatar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you may apply a lot of money for the purchase of players , but with legitimate import sources , you have to handle the break @-@ even point in their on the football @-@ related business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FF@@ P was conceived by Michel Plat@@ ini , after his election to the UEFA President in 2007 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former French player believed that clubs in their pursu@@ it had taken enormous debts in their quest to ruin , when banks or owners moved their support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P from the concentration to the debts of the clubs refer to the surveillance of their losses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the change meant that the business model , the novel Abra@@ mo@@ vich originally bought a club with potential and then invested strongly in order to build the crew and build up a global brand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the current three @-@ year subscription period , the club runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses of 30 million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the presidency in 2015 , his UEFA @-@ successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ ha@@ ge continues to put off by excessive expenditure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we will rein@@ force the rules for the future yet , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEFA EURO , compared with The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out cl@@ ause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a l@@ ump sum , it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of his contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the withdrawal will be issued for the next five years in the amount of EUR 4@@ 4.4 million in the financial statements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has merged with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with its he@@ avi@@ est sanctions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PS@@ G was granted a fine of € 60 million ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which later was reduced to € 20 million for the Champions League of season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of otherwise normal 25 players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UEFA is searching for clubs who could try to list their financial view by taking their income by companies , which are connected to the owners of a club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while a cat@@ ar@@ act enterprise has won the PS@@ G sponsors , if the value of the sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEFA EURO would not be regarded as legitimate income . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this happened in 2014 , when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsor@@ ing of the P@@ ils of the Qatar Tourism Authority was b@@ lower . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was reported that a part of PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar would come to Qatar for the Organ@@ izing Committee of the World Cup 2006 in Qatar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but PS@@ G and Qatar would have cont@@ ested that N@@ ey@@ mar WM ambassador will be addressed , and such a maneu@@ ver for the UEFA regul@@ ators will be easy to figure out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G will mean that the UEFA EURO is to be considered , every attempt to b@@ ypass the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UEFA Cup did not have any prepared talks with PS@@ G on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , which was entrusted to the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they spoke under the condition of the anony@@ m@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , as it was not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest reports published that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has achieved a turnover of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accounts for the last financial year must be published .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrive is a blessing for Sponsor@@ ing De@@ als , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot purchases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association proceeds from , that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after signing up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best soccer players , and tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s way@@ mark by saying that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial d@@ oping &quot; with the club and the State , &quot; said the president of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS related to Qatar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
arsen@@ al manager Arsen@@ e W@@ enger , whose organisation is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons division , divi@@ des La League &apos;s reservation against a state which is financed by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has completely changed the entire landscape of soccer in the last 15 years , &quot; said W@@ enger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association it is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be very difficult to respect the financial fair Fair@@ play , because you can have different ways or different interests , if a country has such a large player to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ ate supplier
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y board has made board chocolate for the Swiss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , in collaboration with a possible end : the airline immediately writes the order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed an appropriate report on the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schwei@@ z &quot; on request of the news agency S@@ DA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the current planning , the airline will close a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products would be reviewed and subjected to quality control for every two to three years .
&quot; with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; said the speakers .
around 17 million small red @-@ white s@@ mu@@ g@@ it@@ ters spread over 14 grams per year before landing to the passengers .
the Swiss does not want to make any information about the cost .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; branch secre@@ tions value the order volume according to &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schwei@@ z &quot; to 1.5 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary generated an annual turnover of about one billion Swiss francs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but more important is the public@@ ity effect : for a Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ manufacturer it is a prestigious order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like many applicants in the new call , the Swiss does not want to betra@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but only Swiss manufacturers are coming into question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the newspaper report Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to try a renewal of the contract over the spring of 2018 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the S@@ DA the largest Swiss chocolate factory was not available for a comment .
all the Swiss chocolate boards have been distributed on board their flights since 2006 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the Swiss signed a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut had supplied chocolate @-@ tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the possibility to place the logo , Swiss led two and a half years ago with the start of collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the airline operates with various Swiss chocolate producers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on long h@@ aul flights , the clients of the First Class with treats will be spoiled with treats from the Con@@ fis@@ erie Sp@@ rün@@ gli by Lind@@ t and Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi from Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also distributed in Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi from Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in Business and Economy Class . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; in the niche
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this repeti@@ tion of history is also nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ s years , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ old Gr@@ unge @-@ Com@@ edy , as Elizabeth B@@ anks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to bigger things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a cultural arti@@ fact it is equally a par@@ ody and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like the time would close .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; First Day of Camp &quot; did not work surprisingly well , not just because of its absurd hum@@ ors ( it contained a original story for an attractive can of vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by climbing on the core of the G@@ ags - actors play a lot of children who grow up - but they can still win the impos@@ sibility of winning the last part of the wid@@ ows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who are now playing adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and its par@@ ody of the 90 @-@ er years as &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The Hand kn@@ elt the cra@@ dle &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at one point , a character is brow@@ ned by an Apple Power@@ book , some in@@ line skating and &quot; a number of other things dating back to 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mo@@ reau ) , K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mo@@ reau ) has still not forgotten . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) still has not lost its vir@@ g@@ inity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there is another crazy @-@ v@@ icious Plot with Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ old ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as usual are the ex@@ ams of the best part of the fran@@ chise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is especially fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Rud@@ d , the Matt D@@ ash@@ sta@@ che of &quot; singles &quot; shows , whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy is like a big cra@@ cker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are the moments of random ins@@ an@@ ns that could heat this fran@@ chise : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the band premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon reminds of another kind of nostal@@ gia : at the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; on the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even on &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its East @-@ West ring campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the com@@ edy by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka trained as a director with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director , two officers of Bucharest , who fought for truth , ath@@ e@@ ism and the way of Marx@@ ism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main roles - a hard ges@@ ot@@ ten@@ er Gregor and an ide@@ alistic i@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i ; their dial@@ ogues of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt can be synchron@@ ized in English .
it &apos;s a brilliant idea .
but it &apos;s not much more than an idea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are some nice g@@ ags to look at ( the police sp@@ ends the time to watch chess on TV , as Americans may do it with football ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the list of famous speakers - including Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Chlo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides the voice out for a permanent game &quot; Fin@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desper@@ ate propaganda @-@ Dra@@ mas - a rob@@ ber , which carries a Re@@ agan mask , is included - that it often plays like a single . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with six long episodes the com@@ edy attract it , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequently enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective , &quot; which was more corrupt in a lower length , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef has always been able to visit the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men that he@@ ats a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message for imag@@ inary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a food for food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian creator are not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history , and with their own . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strike on Drug Mafia in the country
the police had an impact on the Italian Mafia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday morning there were numerous objects in the Black Forest district , Constance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the age of 25 , 15 accused were arrested and sentenced to 77 years in arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the officials ordered large amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two people were arrested in the same raid in Italy .
there were German warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects .
the two will probably be delivered to Germany .
in the action Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved .
over 300 police officers were in use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the members of the Mafia is accused of drug criminal , serious violence , attempted murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since summer 2016 the public prosecutor &apos;s public prosecutor was determined against organised drug trading in the southern German region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between the treas@@ ury in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo , a lively exchange and investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the meeting was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of visual acu@@ ity , Italian nationals combined with reference to the Italian Mafia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also a incident on May 27 , at the beginning of the morning several shots were fired into a restaurant , should go to the bank@@ roll account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they lam@@ ents big g@@ aps in the Fore@@ ig@@ ners Register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the report , the Fore@@ ig@@ ners Register in Germany has significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this lead to partly graphic mis@@ decisions with asylum procedures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the endor@@ sed for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has drawn attention to large g@@ aps in the expansion space register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; def@@ ici@@ encies associated with the existing data may lead to asylum procedures and shifts , &quot; partly in an analysis called &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the regi@@ sters , ten million people have been recorded with foreign citizenship , including 5,@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the data is therefore administered by some 600 asp@@ ir@@ ants in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the data has not been sufficiently well maintained , the data quality has not been well maintained in parts so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; by people who are no longer alive or of citizens who are German citizens , and in the register they should not appear anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; incorrect data rates may considerably slow down revers@@ al processes , &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the statistics of out@@ ward people , the EU citizens are covered , which would not have to travel out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , such false assign@@ ments led to &quot; a dist@@ orted debate on dealing with travel light , &quot; says it in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government obviously has begun to return refugee families with less than 16 @-@ year @-@ old children back to Italy when they traveled from there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is going out of an internal paper from the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BAM@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the paper , the BAM@@ F outlines such methods &quot; regarding families with children - with the exception of infants and to@@ dd@@ lers - according to Italy since the 1st of June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the end of 2014 , practically no longer possible , the newspaper was in reference to the difficult situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following the Dublin @-@ Agreement , EU @-@ State is responsible for refugees from the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a mig@@ rant travel to another EU country , this state can send him back to the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason now write to this position : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by now , the capacity of families with children in Italy has greatly increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy made a guarantee for the admission and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) is sufficient for this purpose .
there are also other EU states to return refugees in the context of Dublin @-@ Dublin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inner political spokesperson on the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children threatened due to lack of un@@ lawful admission conditions and a end@@ an@@ gering of the child &apos;s disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 220 litres of blood from in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach , blood @-@ wag@@ ering was already available for other people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least from the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all Ju@@ er@@ Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who now shared 50 litres of blood with its now 100 donations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
traditionally the community has to don@@ ate multiple read@@ iness to don@@ ate blood in the community meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is awesome as our body is created for it and we aff@@ ection@@ ate the don@@ ors to provide your blood for strangers , still inf@@ ested by mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one single blood donation helps several people , explained the head of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Ma@@ isen@@ bacher , as the preserved foods are divided into their parts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so three persons could benefit from a blood flow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , Ma@@ isen@@ bacher told of the actions that are carried out in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach in spring . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; said the DR@@ K cycles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the change to the@@ atri@@ um has led to higher participants a few years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before this , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Um@@ rel had taken care of the majority of blood donations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half so many people book Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ ro@@ mmer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe Vet@@ ter for ten times per 500 milli@@ litre of their li@@ juice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates remain unchanged , after having weak economic growth and weak@@ ening of inflation over a rise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they keep interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) voted to keep interest rates on 0.@@ 25 % , whereby the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase in this month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in its quarterly report , the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.6 % and expected to rise to 1.6 % for 2018 , although inflation is expected to rise to almost 3 % in the fall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they were sign@@ alized , that in the next few years , inflation would need to re@@ prove inflation and said that lending costs may be more than expected to climb to the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the members also voted to withdraw a part of the Mamm@@ ut business package , which was issued a year after the Bre@@ xit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks , although it is expected that it is expected to make 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate said the bank said : &quot; in the central progn@@ osis of the M@@ PC remains weak , because the pressure on the real income of households continued to reduce consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it repeated that &quot; a certain stra@@ igh@@ ten@@ ing of monetary policy &quot; was needed for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; greater extent &quot; that the markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the markets currently forecast the first rise in the third quarter of the next year , and another year 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank however stressed that owing to &quot; step@@ wise &quot; and &quot; limited &quot; would be limited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank forecast down@@ wards for this and next year , in comparison to the growth forecast in May , 1.9 % and 1.7 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has retained its growth progn@@ osis to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell from these messages compared to the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision to no change occurs after the recent dis@@ appo@@ inting growth figures have increased rising expectations on a interest rate and increased GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % to 0.3 % in the previous three months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is slightly to recover after the end of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most recent In@@ fl@@ tions@@ Report offered little enthusiasm for households that become affected by increasing inflation and slight incl@@ ine heights , as the cas@@ hing becomes even worse before they become better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy in the next few years is not able to prevent the income of income , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added that the wages were clearly re@@ covering for the end of their three @-@ year mortality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy is strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pounds due to compens@@ ating the lower consumer expenditure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision is made a year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in August after the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ ks of the fun@@ eral . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bank estimates that it will probably take four years , until this will complete the prices and the economy completely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prior to the final judgement of the bank to the interest rates , the call was increased to an interest rate because inflation increased to 0.5 % due to three political decision @-@ makers in July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inflation has fallen in the past month of 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the bank said that it was expected and to put them back in the coming months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank said that the cri@@ es in relation to its target of 2 % was &quot; entirely attri@@ but@@ able to the weak pounds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ gage , said : &quot; in view of the recent recovery of the swa@@ p rates , the mort@@ gage market should become more competitive again as the len@@ ders want to finish the year in a positive way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the market is particularly good for those who exclu@@ de the existing De@@ als and close the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many are becoming more popular with extra free options and low rates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) is supposed to avoid the controversial HIV @-@ drug 10.000 people
patients will be obtained from September after a fight against the state of high court against the financing of the drug in the N@@ HS access to a &quot; trans@@ forma@@ tive &quot; HIV pre@@ ventive treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ HS England announced that one can reduce the risk of pre@@ posi@@ tional sp@@ rop@@ hy@@ la@@ xes ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the risk of risk in high risk exposure by around 86 percent , which is now delivered by the health service for the first three year study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he agreed to finance the trial , after the Court of App@@ eal confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court in spite of the claims to pay for the Pr@@ EP despite the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should finance it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced on Thursday , was announced by N@@ HS England @-@ boss Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention &quot; during the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual health hospitals in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will follow the first one will follow the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October 2018 in whole England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pre@@ tensions drop@@ let ( Pr@@ EP ) is a sequence of HIV supplements that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP reduced HIV transmission at risk of infection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ EP concerned before sexual intercourse means that there are just enough medicines in the body of a person , to prevent HIV infection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
such medicines may be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to those who come up for the treatment are gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and individuals with HIV positive partners who were not successfully treated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinics , appropriate participants will be identified to agree with the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who live in England and registered with a domestic doctor , can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the program will have £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for delivering the medication this week after an international competitive procurement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the study aims to assess the entire potential of Pr@@ EP , as clinical recei@@ pts are collected , as it is applied in a large scale , taken and implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should supplement the extensive and increasingly successful efforts to feed HIV and over@@ take . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a further milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in addressing one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ orah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ EP , if it is targeted to ne@@ edy and endangered people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV virus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from September to people with high HIV @-@ risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded try to develop a new instrument , which is really controlled and not subject to a negoti@@ ation with a partner who leads to improving many , many lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we welcome very warmly this announcement . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , Chief Executive Officer of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority must now be on the entire country and that no one has left a risk for HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , since the Pr@@ EP @-@ Test@@ medicine was created , we are on the best way to protect over 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on Hodg@@ son , shadow @-@ Minister for Health , said : &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome after months of closing and delayed implementation by the government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the evidence shows how trans@@ forma@@ tive this drug may be part of our approach to the HIV prevention , and the transfer of these life @-@ changing infection can end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible in the whole country to protect people suffering from HIV , and that they will contribute to the end of the spread of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; life live : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced in 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne didn &apos;t packed her bags and sold . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; before I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger space . &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I searched for something that was comparable to my price .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot was completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally a one @-@ room property with a wa@@ sted layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to use Jo@@ anne dam and a mezzanine to optimal use the spacious ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , plenty of light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was my request . &quot; she says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill , which was not just a development but also a place for life for jo@@ anne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms , so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine where you could stand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Er@@ fan had to think creative in order to solve the announcement .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated . &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so arran@@ ging that they were st@@ amped in one another , without that we had to b@@ other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but to attach the steel so that it was right above or below the right height . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement made it possible to place two rooms in full height - with much additional drama .
for the mezzanine a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the glam@@ orous living area .
enclosed gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mirrors Def@@ end play a role when adding theatre , space and light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the two ends a short corridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to make him longer work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the kitchen , the mir@@ r@@ oring feels like a window in another room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the entrance donated units for all the be@@ ech and glasses of jo@@ anne .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the perception of a glam@@ orous room , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special feature of this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering went inside , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that if you pull up the door , very easy gli@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to cle@@ ver@@ en use of space and storage room , Jo@@ anne could gain extra 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will sell the floor space , or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ vin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a di@@ mental form a real estate agent will occur and a calculation based on the floor size . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , they managed to enlarge the floor space and use high @-@ quality materials that provide space to its luxurious advantage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things you touch and which help you to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ vin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love you in electrical outlets in the walls .
these are important but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and increased square meter of some standard , something completely amazing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
brethren fight for a $ 500 million dollar property
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two brothers are four decades , after their Italian family established the Dy@@ nasty , in a confron@@ tation of more than 500 million dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer Colin De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors of his younger brother Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp discussion on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court of Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with her mother Anna have collected 38 properties in the value of more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a shop at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there the West@@ co Je@@ ans family founded and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold to 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now comprises offices in the city centre around Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the subur@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after an agreement with their late father Colin Colin - by Paul as &quot; chief operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family , about two @-@ thirds of the company &apos;s wealth and Paul approximately one third . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of jurisdiction , it means that Colin property has valued at 316 million dollars and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the allocation of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul as the problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leaders of the leaders have left him with that which I held for the best objects , &quot; wrote in 2015 in a first affair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last Friday , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failed counter@@ acts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brothers also fight for control over existing business - from what Colin , as Paul claims to have ruled him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Colin was ar@@ gu@@ ing that it is not true but throws Paul ahead of managing some of the property .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an early aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it that was lodged by Colin , he says , he hope to join the dispute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage wrote before the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , e @-@ mails and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , among them Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and both parties held in the Bar Association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi , Italian immigrants , who operated milk bars and Del@@ ic@@ at@@ ess@@ ences from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they used security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , in the Colin the first je@@ ans of the family opened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Colin says that he started West@@ co when he was in my last years of High School when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hopes to admit their property to their sons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi said often to me that he never wanted to land the brothers before court , &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no more part of De Lu@@ tis Group , and Colin Colin that Mark has paid € 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark were , so Paul says about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Colin has declined very , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from the year 2015 of Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of television stars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fair@@ fax Media participated in Colin and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only Colin answered by SMS to say &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul decided to dress me and to dress our family name through the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mid @-@ 2016 Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfil the demands of his brother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father did not want that Paul and I would end in our current dispute , &quot; he said and added that he was still hoping for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our matter will be solved by the courts in the near future . &quot; Colin Colin .
Tr@@ ump of Chief of Staff is planning to limit the media abst@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; POL@@ IC@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restri@@ ct the information flow to President Tr@@ ump , including reports from the news media , in hope to keep the boss on a uniform course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here is a piece by repor@@ ter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , at his first working day , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ ump White House , which he would repair : poor information that get into the hands of the president . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kelly told the staff that information should flow over him , whether on paper or in letters - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good informations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kell@@ ys Diagnos@@ is make sense but others tried to tell Tr@@ ump by monitoring his media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tr@@ ump connection to television sets decades back - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertisement is still strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when candidate was upset due to un@@ fair reporting , it was counter@@ productive that he had a fair reporting of places that had been persu@@ aded to convince him that he said P@@ im@@ berg in February against Pol@@ it@@ ICO . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politicians Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; the key , Tr@@ ump &apos;s Twitter habit is under control to ensure that his personal media use includes a constant praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that Tr@@ ump &apos;s Twitter habit was ever under control , is ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps these combat officials know something that we do not know , that Tr@@ ump twe@@ ets could have included more ignition failures without their interventions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets , which has not been sent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if his staff had a few times to keep him away from him , their efforts have paid off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but nobody has been able to hin@@ der it consistently that Tr@@ ump Contro@@ vers@@ y is calling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a part of the problem exists that people in a White House , which together , composed of competing parties , will always try to present their own agenda by promoting these views from the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ tico - quite with this story - reported in May about the pre@@ ference of advis@@ ors , to bring the president responsible for strategic reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was an example described by repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former tr@@ ump @-@ officials say that Tr@@ ump can react to negative press sections , especially those with sham@@ eful le@@ aks , and that he desc@@ end to it where they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exactly that happened at the end of February , when someone accused the president of an article of Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ alist Charles C. Johnson , called the source behind a pile to be at the White House . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter or that he has not offered a specific evidence , or did he vo@@ ke in the past and re@@ vo@@ ke it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump was reading the article and began to ask people about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ macher added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the secretary general of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tries to implement a system to manage and document the tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps he will prove to be more effective than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still strive for influence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this un@@ changing factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
Master requested crimin@@ als get post from Euro@@ pol
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the address is unknown , the help of the population will pray and hope . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police shipped across Europe in this summer ( virtual ) postcards on dangerous det@@ ailing on the run .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the addresses of the requested is not known naturally , evidence of the population will be hoping and pray . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the Aktion , which follows the &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; calendar of winter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the experiences would have been shown that many fle@@ eting in vacation rentals are hidden , it was named by Euro@@ pol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have compiled 21 postcards covering 21 EU countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ er@@ ischer wanted to see more than 2.5 million times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 36 of the online donations could so far be arrested , at least eleven of them due to publication on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
trav@@ ellers negoti@@ ate on a ditch and return to the &apos; Million@@ är@@ s series &apos;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est domestic owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some resol@@ ute travelers on war@@ ms , which have excav@@ ated by the church dressed in order to rec@@ la@@ im a field in front of its manor houses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; travelers have par@@ ked their 20 caravans on a field outside of a wealthy road from Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; Million@@ är@@ s series . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have brought horses , babies and an army of transport , after being thrown out only in May , without being thrown out of the ditch dig@@ ging out to prevent its sei@@ zu@@ res . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense units and pushed their vehicles through a section which remained un@@ ob@@ struc@@ ted to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people of Soli@@ hull have passed the Council of Soli@@ hull , saying that it is &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous inhabitants said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were sent there on Monday evening after they were sent to the Pass@@ es by Bentley He@@ ath . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced by shame to implement , since he was useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; travelers were there in May , and are now moved back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more came yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by taking long instructions to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road , and I &apos;m not happy to pay my com@@ edy when the Council can &apos;t stop it once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a resident that would not be called , said : &quot; it is ridi@@ culous , we just visited the last round of this trav@@ eller only to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the figures have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot;
a speaker of the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; we are conscious of an un@@ authorized bearing on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we sei@@ ze the necessary legal steps in order to keep them as fast as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to support our case collection , it is very important that many residents can report a anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation , in which the court must consider when we submit our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bir@@ ch is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is located .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the house in front of the city &apos;s gates is currently being renovated , and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those are good news for the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because with the closure of the Hotel Birken@@ hof on 13 April 2014 , approximately 30 000 nights per year was lost and revenue is lost through the tourist tax . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the fall of 2014 , in view of the numbers of refugees that came into the county , the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation for controversial discussions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a planning plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not disputed then in the municipal council .
but above all the city &apos;s chief Apostle Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the hotel and already spoke of serious interested parties in the house .
he was to keep right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern the group of Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels acquired Ms. Sch@@ erer in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern with a voluntary auction in Berlin , and wants to make it back to a house of three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter facility .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Men &apos;s al@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are called Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the earlier hotel Birken@@ hof , there have been a long time construction container before the entrance , and when you enter the house , extensive renovation work is made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the floors were pulled out , ceilings to be disman@@ tled , tu@@ bs are removed from the rooms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole hotel building is one single building site .
there is much to be done until March .
&quot; it is actually a nice hotel &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is supposed to be renewed in the Black Forest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk showers , the entrance area is converted , new windows are built . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything , later , will be very natur@@ alistic , as Thomas Sch@@ erer is expres@@ sing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one may not be positioned at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a higher inner city level , empha@@ sizes Klo@@ ppers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms can set up broad , explains Sch@@ erer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both groups or business people are supposed to feel comfortable in the hotel .
talks with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and tourist director Michael K@@ rau@@ se has already led to that .
the shows of the city are identical with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after investment in investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to define exactly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scar@@ ce less than a million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the outside plants are also brought to front of front . it is clearly visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a courtyard , a large terrace will create a large terrace that will be open to the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : U.S. Special Represent@@ atives sets a Grand Jury
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Russia affair for U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump , Robert Mu@@ eller is to have deployed a so @-@ called Grand Jury according to a report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent weeks , the panel wrote the work , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; under appeal to the thing confidential . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper sow@@ ed the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded his investigation and strengthened its investigations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the transmitter CNN reported , there is already the first demonstration of the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ ump el@@ dest son and a Russian lawyers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
U.S. intelligence services accused the Kre@@ m@@ lin since long time to have inter@@ mixed in the presidential elections in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller studied if there were agreements between Tr@@ ump votes and Moscow .
in the focus of investigations there are several men standing in the election campaign as a consultant of the Republi@@ can .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller also increased more and more dr@@ umps and business areas under the magni@@ fying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few weeks ago , the Washington Post wrote that the Sonder@@ ret@@ tor Tr@@ ump was personally ch@@ ann@@ eled into the center and the accus@@ ation , whether the president in the course of the affair may be ob@@ struc@@ ted the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main task of Grand Law@@ ys is to examine and decide existing evidence in possible cases , and decide whether the accus@@ ation shall be collected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Grand Law@@ ys are therefore also called count sections .
usually they are switched on when it concerns bigger and controversial cases .
the process always takes place behind closed doors .
the panel can also be switched on by the public prosecutor to present people to the perception under oath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the transmitter , CNN has already been issued , which revol@@ ves around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persons , who were involved in the meeting , were promp@@ ted to be a statement in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should also provide documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. also Tr@@ ump advis@@ ors and law @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared Kus@@ h@@ ner and his dam@@ al@@ ous election chef Paul Man@@ a@@ fort , with the interview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday evening , right in the US television announced that Mu@@ eller could not be shy in his work and that he should be necessary to act quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the survey of an accus@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the sub@@ ordination of the body of the beginning of a new phase is resear@@ ching and a new foundation for President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am@@ id@@ st the new revel@@ ations , the President on Thursday evening used a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as campaign of his political opponents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Russia history is a total invention &apos; said Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic give the Democrats a way to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his special Ad@@ visor T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement , he wis@@ ely knew nothing of the establishment of a Grand Jury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but they usually work in sec@@ rec@@ y and stressed .
the White House endor@@ se any measures that accelerated the work of a special agent in a fair way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times , that won &apos;t be determined against the President . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have no reason to assume that something has changed , it was said in the explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this root , accus@@ ations had become noisy , having wanted to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June prior to a Senate committee , Com@@ ey asked him to hir@@ ing a investigations against the former national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President stands under great pressure for the investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the US media , the White House gathered material against the promot@@ ers and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that caused spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wants to release mu@@ eller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unlike an independent special medi@@ ator of the Congress , as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , Mu@@ eller has held a position in which he could not be fired at D@@ aff@@ gen &apos;s President of Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties intend to prevent such a step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two groups of republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators found bills at the Thursday , after which the special promot@@ ers could not be dismissed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ant@@ arc@@ tica : gigantic Eis@@ berg drives in Ant@@ arc@@ tica
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Western Ant@@ ar@@ ctic , an enormous ice@@ berg from the scar@@ city of Berlin has succeeded by the Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was shared by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener @-@ Institut for Polar@@ - and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometres of large colon@@ ists now travel to the north and probably will take two , three years until it has been melted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is approximately 175 kilometers long and a width of up to 50 kilometers one of the largest ice species , which have registered over the past three decades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no danger to people from him .
to what climate change the role of climate change has played a role in the demo@@ lition of the ice@@ berg is un@@ clear to research .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a total of 30 years , there has been a series of unusual clas@@ ps of ice @-@ houses in the region , writes the US research centre for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fac@@ t@@ background . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to many researchers that can be associated with global warming .
now the broken col@@ oss was a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is so far .
Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by big gl@@ ac@@ iers .
it continues to grow in the sea and breaks off regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the top of the ant@@ ar@@ ctic peninsula .
the north of this circle was the balance of wa@@ xes and dis@@ rup@@ ting a few years ago .
a complete serp@@ ent@@ ail is to be disin@@ teg@@ rated where AW@@ I @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I speak some things that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is in danger , because the front edge has never been so far withdrawn as currently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the iron plate under tension and can be disin@@ teg@@ rated , if at a key point of a piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is and Eis@@ berg do not increase the sea level , as they swim in the water and ur@@ ges the ice as much water as it becomes after the melt itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the loss of a loop means that the gl@@ ac@@ iers can flow straight into the sea and flow much faster than before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this could possibly increase the level of level , but only in the low degree , writes the British research project to observe Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is named after AW@@ I @-@ Information with almost 50 000 square kilometers the fourth @-@ largest sna@@ kes of Ant@@ arc@@ tica .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the transition from the mainland is up to 700 meters thick , on the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it breaks down regularly there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural park and no direct link to climate change is aware of , the ice plate is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is the longest retreat since the start of the record . &quot; he also confirmed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under scientists say , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is will res@@ ume once again or in the long term , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if this researcher does not lead to climate change on climate change , the Ant@@ ar@@ ctic Peninsula have been falling in recent decades now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this long tip of the Ant@@ ar@@ ctic stretches towards South America .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to data from the British Ant@@ ar@@ ctic Survey , the ice area of the Ant@@ ar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the increase in temperature was contributed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ant@@ ar@@ ctic Peninsula has heated around three degrees over the past 50 years , and tell its areas where the temperature is fastest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
CDU wants us lift during the staff
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is becoming increasingly difficult to occupy free vac@@ ancies , ur@@ ges the CDU out of the employers association to become more attractive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just before the summer break , the cra@@ yon has spent 41 new positions in the administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 1100 employees and officials will work for the department management in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now even 17 apprentic@@ es have their first working day .
the teaching places are obviously very popular .
some 620 applicants were listed for those participating in this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the circuit is still missing to overcome the increased requirements and tasks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is M@@ ett@@ mann circle after 50 un@@ occupied places .
among others physi@@ cians and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought .
the CDU would now sei@@ ze the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG in the administration of the administration .
the administration is supposed to work as a concept for personnel development and personnel development after the wish of the parties . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the goal is to cover not only short @-@ term demand for professionals , but to opp@@ ose the candidate &apos;s future proof . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the overall concept should include inward and outside , concrete measures for cross @-@ outs and include a training initiative , request the CDU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that sounds like a good approach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the circle has to do with personal problems , which you did not know earlier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other towns adverti@@ se good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms .
the speech is from a real &quot; competition of public employers . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , a high number of employees , the disease or age @-@ related from the service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
highest time for action so that no more spots remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , President of the CDU , continues with his party beyond the common application .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was already in a chal@@ k day for a big surprise when he publicly posed the personnel costs publicly in question , and the remaining parties flour@@ ished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
peoples would like to check all the possibilities which allow a exit from the municipal business association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we don &apos;t come to a satisfactory solution here at short notice , it should strive for trade unions - perhaps also in co @-@ operation with the circular cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the CDU , the employees and officials try to pay better when it is actually looking for the public service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sal@@ aries are currently prescribed exactly , enh@@ ancements or more money there is only if one changes to a higher level that is orient@@ ated to professional years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the tasks of the circle has grown increasing in recent years .
only a few weeks ago new rooms had to be established in which employees deal with the provisions of the new pro@@ stitute law .
not least by the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers have the Council of Thomas Hend@@ ele and director Martin Richter a problem : they have too few staff .
Italy has shar@@ pen@@ ed the tone for the NGO migrants &apos; NGOs
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NGOs that have used the li@@ f@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , war@@ ns that they are not allowed to continue their new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not post any new Code of Con@@ duct , it is difficult to see how they can work , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Min@@ ni@@ tis alert was a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat to the German aid organisation &apos; youth R@@ ettet &apos; , because their crew had worked closely with men &apos;s hands in a way which lighten@@ ed the illegal immigration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the relief organisation , which has been operation only since a year , refused to out@@ ward further di@@ so@@ res of the Italian prosecutor Amb@@ ro@@ gio carto@@ sio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the salvation of human life is our top priority . so , we are sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; said the organization in a opinion on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can judge all accus@@ ations that are currently raised , after we have collected all information and judge the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Italian authorities opened the boat from &apos; youth R@@ ettet , &quot; I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is pres@@ umed that his crew must take din@@ gh@@ y migrants on board , who can drive them directly from human hands and that the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can be used again , so that the ships can be used again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least one such meetings took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the acts of state forest , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the occupation is suspected to susp@@ ect through the authority of Italian coast@@ guards , rescue operations in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not from any other moti@@ fs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the code of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a primarily had an Italian police officer , who monitors their activities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far explained to the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said the new rules as unnecessary , but acceptable would not be acceptable if they wouldn &apos;t be able to bring substantial changes or disabilities in their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refused to sign it is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organization of doctors without borders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , Minn@@ iti said that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue measures in Italy , in recent weeks , that the efforts to strengthen Libyan coast guards and cooperation with the local citizenship have been carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have begun to see Light at the end of the tun@@ nels , &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali over measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nine W@@ eil@@ er@@ mer Bik@@ ers , who met Berlin &apos;s out@@ posts and two guest drivers met in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz for four days to enjoy tri@@ als and sights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
three ordered guides were available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for touring .
the Burg@@ undy and wine festival of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ ar@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it followed observation points , partly on towers , from which one could look across the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest and the above sea levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in between there was always longer climb@@ s for the long tri@@ als .
on the second day there went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the festival .
again on the look@@ out point to view point , &quot; Tri@@ als &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
in the last two days many al@@ titudes were announced .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and dis@@ closed breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers ad@@ ressed in the open @-@ air con@@ servatory .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 173 kilometers and almost 4500 m altitude , the group had met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest of its best - spor@@ tive and cultural . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
console instead of lawn - Bundesliga equipment for e @-@ sport
sit the sport stars in the future ahead of computer consoles instead of swe@@ ating from wind and weather over the stadium races ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fact : e @-@ Sport has become a serious industry that has become a lu@@ cra@@ tive business , with big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments included . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also recognized the first federal states that are increasingly committed in this field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the beginning of the year 2015 V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg followed the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , which founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the gaming 17 under contract .
&quot; we hope to inspire the brand new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B &quot; says President Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that one can climb several clubs on this turn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next weekend , the football world association organized the first &quot; Inter@@ active Club World Cup , in which the Gam@@ er Club compete against each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beside Schal@@ ke and Wolfsburg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven have qualified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in the E @-@ Sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has now advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real football must take place in particular with the 14 to 30 years of age that young people are still going into the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and : the publishers tried to conquer all sorts of markets , especially the Asian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with prominent electric sports@@ men under contract , one could be more often present on these markets than once a year to send the federal government to Asia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how is it exactly ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the e @-@ sport computer games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; Dot@@ A 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or even the football simulation FIFA at competitive edge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long ago , as in normal sport , men have established itself in which the pros compete against each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and in Asia &apos;s application E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it all about a proper sport ?
for many is the idea of getting used in need .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ bed has also dealt with the question for a long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the professor at the German Sport@@ s- University in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because he is com@@ peti@@ tive and many biological and physical reactions you can also find in classical sport , for example increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , cognitive abilities need cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise on the console but also mind their body and respect the diet .
&quot; the final player is a good player . &quot;
ac@@ rob@@ ous also sees problems : &quot; d@@ oping is becoming a topic . &quot;
checks should be fe@@ a@@ sible in online games and in the scene they lack@@ ed the structures of classical Sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in positive terms , the scientists highlight the high integ@@ rative effect of the E @-@ Sports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players are on the way internationally , this is like a big global family , there is no inter@@ cultural im@@ pedi@@ ments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a study by the corporate consulting Del@@ o@@ itte and the German Federal Association Inter@@ active entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts the e @-@ sport a rapid growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ship and great tournaments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sales should be 130 million in three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with nearly 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga , this is little . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the e @-@ sport is not far removed from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; the Del@@ o@@ itte consultant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many countries are already going to continue .
great markets are Asia and the US where Ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez participate in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actors Ash@@ ton K@@ ut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport competition Uni@@ kr@@ n .
a lot in Europe also does .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a Norwegian school , e @-@ Sport was established as a class@@ room , says F@@ rob@@ bed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Netherlands and France , the football @-@ first league @-@ league di@@ ps are now required to set up an E @-@ Sport division . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison , Germany , &quot; explains the V@@ f@@ B board of R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only in nostal@@ gia to fall off , and the ancient times to clari@@ fy , is no longer enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is therefore to preserve the tradition of the association , but the company is simultaneously set up on the modern market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we are living in a digital world , &quot; says D@@ utt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t hold on it that only at the football , everything stays as it was always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Carter was sentenced to life in June for a negli@@ g@@ ent killing of Conrad Roy . he took his life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until calling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has been confron@@ ted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but its legal representatives were ar@@ gued that both they had and Mr Roy in a psychological disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dressed in red tro@@ users and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Carter da was with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down@@ ward eyes than they were convicted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; their actions have taken Conrad Roy . &quot; the State lawyer said to the court .
&quot; she finished his life to make her own better .
she has no responsibility . &quot; she said .
&quot; she showed no repent@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ters said to a lawyer , it was a &quot; aw@@ ful circum@@ stance to whom they are completely regre@@ t@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , did not find out that their &quot; age or maturity or even their mental disease have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an prosecutor read an explanation of Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that &quot; there is no day in which I would not worship the loss of my beloved son . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to see that he is proud of me and how I walk with everything . I try , despite all my pain , which we will bear with us for ever and for his sisters , &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she will take part of the knowledge &quot; will never be able to take part in the wedding of her brother or her a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not to have this one person with which I was working every day for my birth , is a pain that I always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the case seems to put right precision , since there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime committed to commit suicide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the event attracted national attention , after Car@@ ters text@@ books had encouraged him to finish his life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hän@@ g you up , spring from a building , you don &apos;t know , there &apos;s many ways , she said in several weeks before his death , while he was with his family on holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the eyes of his suicide , she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Conrad &quot; and &quot; All that you have to do is to turn the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter searched attention through the death of Roy , and ordered that they should benefit from any press of the case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case has the legal opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the few , the Carter &apos;s defence , Am@@ anda Fort Knox , was sentenced to Italy in 2007 because of her British fellow country@@ woman who was acquitted two years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Knox , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter ear@@ ns compassion and help , not prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learn about the new Mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua was allowed to run the Audi Cup as captain of the Audi Cup she is not a co@@ incidence .
the FC Bayern shows the Con@@ fed Cup winner a big season - Extra motivation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something was different from his place in the cabin , which saw Joshua Kim@@ me immediately , even if the extra clothing piece was very , very small . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since far and wide on the second day of Audi C@@ ups , there was no Philipp L@@ ah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er to see him , he made his rush away from his arm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer had not announced it , &quot; the Con@@ fed Cup winner after his first deployment in Bavaria @-@ captain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
good that could have run better than 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but I could interpret the sign from the coach too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not the eight years older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a leader in youth games , de@@ but@@ ants and just chosen C @-@ El@@ f as a player guide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be@@ ware of sugar , sugar is much distributed to those who want to do a good mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who are cho@@ oses to en@@ list the inheritance of L@@ ah@@ m , can use a small extra motivation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kim@@ me confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player : taking responsibility . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old was fl@@ itter@@ ing over the field on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the right side , that is now its position , the white binder on the arm did the rest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and at all Kim@@ i had worked in this position as the one , who can also take the ru@@ dder together into the hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he gave instructions to ste@@ er the un@@ played tro@@ upe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had the view for the whole , while many others were busy with himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ dal therefore , to re@@ play his missing fitness ( fol@@ dable ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ger gets up to the performance of the Asia Travel ( fol@@ dable also only ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Nikl@@ as Sü@@ le can &apos;t fall back on their first appearance in Bavaria tri@@ cot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the anyway was fol@@ dable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next to Kim@@ i , Rud@@ y went ahead of the defense against Kim@@ i , both agile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the well @-@ occupied Nap@@ oli storm lasted often difficult , in addition , Sü@@ le tried to develop a couple of times even in the play . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Rud@@ y gave to his colleague Rud@@ y , that the result was &quot; not so , as we hoping for this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also he showed a decent performance in the debut .
game @-@ shift : tem@@ po@@ changes : &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as unusual , this Bayern world is still looking for new additions , one looked after the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , Rud@@ y gave no one or two interviews in cat@@ acom@@ bs , but for example six or seven interviews . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kim@@ me retired after a few ch@@ oked statements on the back of his new players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard from Sü@@ le an interesting proposition : &quot; what is going on , I already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bavaria you simply need to win any game . &quot;
but he does not have to teach the new .

company content with rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ic Minister : business pra@@ ises Wis@@ dom Tempo
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; often it was in@@ con@@ cili@@ atory , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke ( Green ) nor economic Minister of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is reflected after more than one year , in which the new economic Minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chambers and companies from the region speak on T V enquiry from a change in the economic policy - and simultaneously the old female Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ der Enterprises ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing takes up the wishes of the economy that the Lem@@ ke has blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest turn@@ sti@@ ce sees Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the L@@ ück@@ er decision of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and aden@@ au is now in the pri@@ ori@@ tisation list of the country now completely above .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , the ministry is hoping for a planning procedure , until 2021 the building is supposed to stand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the west@@ side of Trier , which is in the ob@@ tru@@ sive demand of the Federal Office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim is to put into operation in December 2020 , says Minist@@ eri@@ on of Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ us sees there a sign@@ post to support regional but international competing companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chamber of Commerce ( Commerce ) Trier aims to boost the market in supermarkets , such as a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate and stop the trend of the German wine exports for ten years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing have an open ear for people who want to create their own company , the Chamber of Commerce pra@@ ises . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Handwerk@@ skammer Trier sees an additional incentive for young trainees , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; provided is a premium of 1000 Euro for the compound master testing and 2500 euros , when graduates have become self @-@ employed within ten years after the master training . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the planned road construction might be quick facts to create , at the same time , it fails the land on the necessary staff , says Jan Plan@@ auer , chief managing director of the Chamber of Trier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from 56 new engineers , which wants to set mobility while working on the country , only 29 places have been occupied until now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more orders to external offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S &amp; D spokesperson on calculations of the invoice , the country invested more than 20 million euros in 2017 and will be proposed for more than 20 million euros in 2018 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Frank Nat@@ us is still expecting a concept of the country as it wants to resolve the secret of the labour power in the region .
the old broad@@ band building in the country is further in the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 , regional companies had evaluated the supply of power in an I@@ HK survey only with the note 3,4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compla@@ in about mol@@ esting internet links and abor@@ tions .
ex @-@ economic Minister Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still sitting on the Supervisory Board of the Wind Mill Pro Wind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Green Group left Lem@@ ke to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where they already cleared up the field after four months due to in@@ consisten@@ cies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Audi should alter 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - auto@@ oh@@ er@@ actors see themselves with a counter @-@ reaction
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one day before the announcement of Audi said BMW , that it would offer the software update in more than 35@@ ,000 vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW leader said that &quot; it is the opinion that &quot; there are smar@@ ter options as restrictions , &quot; which is based on European cities - including Munich where BMW is based on or restri@@ ct diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Tuesday , Daimler announced that three million Mercedes vehicles will be modified in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of the companies described the companies as a recall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the nitrogen oxi@@ des , em@@ itting the diesel engines , are considered carcin@@ ogen@@ ic and can cause as@@ thma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of car manufacturers , systems for neutr@@ alisation of exhaust gases to install from diesel vehicles , also take what it makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignor@@ ing the powerful auto@@ companies and ignore the signs of the problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called block@@ age devices to regulate the rules when a car was tested , but with normal driving conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the United States , several employees were indicted by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month , the former director of ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ik was arrested in Germany in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be ordered in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of this year Audi was included in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen , having installed the regulatory requirements in Europe to handle the emission regulations in Europe and a request that was focused on the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inclusion of Audi in the study could hardly ever strain , however : the luxury car manufacturer contributes to the gain of Volkswagen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to participate in the Is@@ ar visitors , the Saturday night shows a raft through Munich , which has a special message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who once again passes to Is@@ ar on Saturday , will see a big raft there between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and this is not a common raft . with Is@@ ar @-@ tourists .
but the building reference wants to clari@@ fy .
on the raft you can see a large inf@@ ot@@ ran@@ spar@@ ent .
it shows a tr@@ ash .
the start to a public campaign to app@@ end to the Icel@@ ar visitors .
with the motto &quot; True Love &quot; is ... the Under@@ standing for the Is@@ ar as a protective sav@@ our@@ ing of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during last summer , the raft of the Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ es and the laughter against suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was simultaneously one of the most published cartoon illustr@@ ator , the Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ es of his figures are his brand name .
also with 85 the Argent@@ in@@ ean market is still working on a film .
his message : laughter ; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first years as an artist , he stroke himself as a sign for happiness tickets - what fru@@ str@@ ated him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most happy day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job . &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris in the late 60s of the breakthrough : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
the artists of cities are still inspired again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures tum@@ ble in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the early morning , according to the drawing , he is still sitting on the drawing , works daily for almost ten hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about calendars , puzzles , books for Gross and Small , T @-@ Shirts , Pl@@ ush favor@@ ites and watches , find his dro@@ l@@ ous figures worldwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for six years he has also been working on a cartoon animation , and a TV series with his figures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main person in the film &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los favourite animal in his drawings , which has an exchange rate as counter player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time his figures speak in the 3D movie , which will come to the cinema screen in 2019 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange to me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , he is more likely to see the TV series which , like its original drawings , word@@ lessly be produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence is threatened with climate change
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened with climate change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the conditions of drought re@@ mind@@ ing conditions and because of the diseases transferred insects falling , what scientists and farmers try to find solutions to find great head@@ ache . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , head of the CR@@ I@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the Lav@@ en@@ del in Provence is effectively at risk because the plant has taken much less rain in spring and in autumn much more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this has effects on the service life of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is also a small c@@ ic@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium , the d@@ warf @-@ c@@ ades , and very dry weather is very many . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there is a lot on the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil is not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers ; it is also very important for perfume and cosmetics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the solutions that are considered in consideration are a better water distribution and slow@@ ing down the plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of sorts , which are resistant to dry conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the town of Ge@@ isa in the Chi@@ ing@@ ian R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1,200 @-@ year anniversary .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Krä@@ mer , guil@@ ds , tra@@ der , vag@@ ant or a land ne@@ sting camp will be able to experience these days in the city center . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the assassination of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce employees normally meet her plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sin@@ al@@ oa , through organised crime , corrupt civil servants and un@@ ce@@ asing drug wars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was told them that it is important to change their routines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels more secure : they should take their children with the office , who were at home in 2009 , or leave them home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safety experts have written three words onto a panel on the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they ask the repor@@ ter to propose names for each column - no proof is needed , per@@ cep@@ tions and abdominal cav@@ ity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are drug s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business people , journalists , who are suspected to stand on the list of government or the cart@@ els , a catalogue of crimin@@ als which make chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no resting days of violence , and throughout the country the bodies are pil@@ ed , there are more and more journalists at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to have been under federal laws and until now there were at least seven dead in seven countries this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the latter are their editor and its in@@ spir@@ ator of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and journalist , Val@@ dez wrote in one of its numerous books about violence in connection with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his lack is felt deeply , although its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , which shows its middle finger with the word &quot; Justice . &quot; two Reporter in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , carry T @-@ shirts , which show its smiling face with glasses or typical pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the workshop will take place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ter will discuss their shared topics , the trau@@ ma , its night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although a probe @-@ German general was erected in 2010 to process the cases of journalists , it has led only two criminal proceedings to protect journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with most thousands of mur@@ ders each year associated with drug trading and organised crime , the mur@@ ders of journalists are rarely put before court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still exist to treat the violence of Sin@@ al@@ oa , even though it is un@@ tr@@ unc@@ ated and although the terrain is still ter@@ restrial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting on discussion of security says little use , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is really stupid to wa@@ sting my time in this workshop . &quot; he says .
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why we susp@@ icious all . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the morning of May 15th , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the regional capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was forced by two men , presumably , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - that is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ ve River . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sc@@ orer drove away in his car and damaged it in the vicinity .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left one woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ al@@ oa became one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields in the country , since rival fac@@ tions fight here to fill the vacuum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is nothing that in Sin@@ al@@ oa is shot every day or several people on the street or that the cemetery is full of en@@ chan@@ ted , two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug roy@@ alty , which are bigger than many homes for the living . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a minute that there is a state of &quot; rest , &quot; if only a cart@@ el control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drugs trading routes in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless and despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) is a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , to blame for his friend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings contributed to the murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , in February , the publication of a interview with Dam@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of the ri@@ val@@ ry boxes in war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this publication may have been anno@@ yed by the sons , pres@@ umed Gang@@ members bought each copy of the output as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second fault was to force Val@@ dez , after the sei@@ z@@ ure of another newspaper to leave the same story , to leave the country for his own security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had survived so long for his friends and colleagues , that he would always be there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este , when he joined together with five colleagues to the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ al@@ oa , &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without having to push the pir@@ ate problem , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with time , the newspaper served a call for the cour@@ a@@ geous and honest coverage , and sales and public@@ ity took up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; repor@@ ters loved it to publish very accurate research without fear of c@@ ens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication that no one else dare to treat them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot prize &quot; for its coverage in Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee on the Protection of journalists for its courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history wherever it led . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he gave himself up voluntarily to be afraid .
&quot; I would like to continue &quot; live &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug traffic@@ king in Sin@@ al@@ oa is a way of life , &quot; said he in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV in October last October . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you have to take the task which falls to you as a journalist - either you or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in view of such a roller ... why did you not say what &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the fun bird that was like a harbor , and gener@@ ously with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they trusted on his routine .
he always would carry his hat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he always would go to El Gui@@ abo , the bar toward the office , walk and sit there at the same table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they ask : was his love for the routine his companion ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his death also forced them to ask their own ass@@ ump@@ tions , how they get their job done , and stay in life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like to deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home starting and landing run@@ ways . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed &quot; he said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ sage and self @-@ preser@@ ving . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
when it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the anger is said the publisher of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real , that &quot; smell can be a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the thing is happening with Javier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old rules such as he and others say , Sin@@ al@@ oa is no more - just as in Tam@@ au@@ dio@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states , in which a toxic mixture of lu@@ cra@@ tive s@@ mu@@ g@@ ols , weak institutions and corrupt government officials . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the landscape is changing constantly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the room where the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce for security training was suddenly no mobile phones allowed . days before , that sp@@ y@@ ware , which is sold solely on governments , used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two polic@@ emen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were commissioned by the regional government , to protect offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in the middle class of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half the repor@@ ter , some of the repor@@ ters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen , which the Governor itself did not have trusted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is months ago , since the repor@@ ter went into the mountain landscape , where drug ad@@ joining forces are under control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has blown up three main stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the killing of the brother of the former famous boxing builder Ju@@ lio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ al@@ oa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they also had an expos@@ é to the State expenditure , which focused on the home town &apos;s hometown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the temple . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no official word about what was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so it was advised to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a repor@@ ter heard from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , who ruled the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated all political levels almost all the century . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of corruption due to high @-@ quality inci@@ dents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous inci@@ dents in this place , including one , in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man departed from military attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only a few months ago , the readers had watched the column of Val@@ dez as the most informal source of ab@@ duction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously we knew what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its slender body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez was dedicated to storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers , prot@@ esting against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the staff had become something that they could never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next morning , Rep@@ or@@ cist Miri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez rub@@ bed a few signs and went to a demonstration due to another repor@@ ter to the office of the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests , that it is his . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; throughout the country , journalists have become silent and written in organised protests of S@@ OS Press &quot; based on building and constructions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ al@@ oa , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities to sp@@ ying journalists and let them move , because they have said the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has since asked , that she is divided again by the government because she is worried that her rage has hurt its objec@@ tivity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez said to be repeated that journalists in Mexico surrounded by organised crime which were involved in government officials and a Gender Society . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ journ@@ alism &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters were not only killed by drugs links , but also on orders of politicians and security forces who were using organised crime under a blanket . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past year , the media branch group &quot; Artic@@ ul@@ o 19 &quot; has more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you will die because they want to disp@@ el the mouth , &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody forget the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ tho@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your body was found along with a note , which was report@@ edly signed by the Z@@ etas system : &quot; here I &apos;m because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones in addition to their separate head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some branches have chosen to close , as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua , after the assassination of Mi@@ ros@@ lav Bre@@ ach in March . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others continue to do as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo , after the assassination of its director in 2004 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ arez publicly de@@ vised the drug cart@@ els with a Editorial on the front page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some journalists are escaped from their home states or even out of the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and seek dangers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sometimes they will be ch@@ ased , as the photographer Reuben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was apparently murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those who continue to stay and continue working , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky choices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , indicates that drug traffic@@ king made him fri@@ ghtened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mexico is going to hell and therefore I became repor@@ ter . &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at midnight , when the last edition was finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk before the office and drank beer , when all their phones started to sum@@ p . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with Band@@ enri@@ v@@ alen and security forces close to the bathing resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 dead deaths .
the war continued , as promised by a series of Kartell &apos;s messages in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the pav@@ ement edge , they released the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce through cell phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ ren@@ s he@@ ats nearby - a further shooting in the area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen , the guards held to see if they were in will@@ ingness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if they were afraid they did not show it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the enormous portrait of the bree@@ ders of the newspaper , whose center finger was visible for the whole Sin@@ al@@ oa , the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his marks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you can only think about close , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; if on the same day , the intern was asked for sending me to the reporting on the road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ouflage to diver@@ ge his enemies
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at first sight it looks like a statue , even though a fri@@ ghtening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , researchers found out that the first findings of the incredible Nas@@ horn of a Canadian min@@ ers were so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was so well preserved that they could even determine that his created skin was from red@@ dish brown , and they said , she would have had something from a &quot; troubled past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report in &quot; Current Biology &quot; described him as &quot; the best @-@ held mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs , who was ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs copies in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs , who lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his incredibly well received state has researchers to describe it as &quot; really remarkable , &quot; confused . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic the ar@@ mo@@ red plant ni@@ vo@@ res is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn radio when he was in the Sun@@ cor M@@ illen@@ ium Mine , near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he met up something which seemed to the surrounding rock , and decided to look closely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1.@@ 100 kg ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all this hard work , the final result is now ready to be revealed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you b@@ link only a little about the eyes , you might think it slept , &quot; said the main actor Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum where the creature is visible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ rs copies - the Mon@@ a Lisa in the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; researchers found out that this car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res , although it is covered with arm@@ or and a changing tank , probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous Din@@ os@@ cow@@ ern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the strongly ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide themselves from pir@@ ate , and used a par@@ ach@@ ment technology that is used as counter@@ part that is also used by many modern animals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would have allowed to avoid himself better in its surroundings and to diver@@ t its enemies , say what it indicates that it was threatened by bigger Din@@ os@@ cow@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 110 million years old creature of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs family made the news for the first time in May and is now to be seen in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and made Bo@@ is@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli following the Muse@@ um@@ st@@ echni@@ ker Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to cover it carefully . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the amazing maintenance of specimen made it possible by Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of d@@ and@@ ru@@ ff and arm@@ aments of his body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they discovered the sh@@ ady , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than its under@@ side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the con@@ dens@@ ation is common , the results are surprising as the size of bo@@ vine by far exceeds the living animals today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs was ch@@ ased by sufficient pressure by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , that the evolution of confron@@ tation was fav@@ oured as a means of survival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but most of contemporary animals , who use the conf@@ using sh@@ ady - do you think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt animals - are much smaller and harm than prey , that this no@@ dos@@ au@@ ral was exposed to survival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong ro@@ b @-@ behaviour on a massive , strong ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs ro@@ dents have been , &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the Din@@ os@@ cow@@ rie was red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scientists continue to examine the animal on critics about his life , including his con@@ stituted performance , to figure out what it had eaten as his last meal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , went into a river where he fell on his back to the sea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , Alberta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably much more widespread than they are today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ ra is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preser@@ vative skin but also maintains its original form of the animal , &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal today looks almost just like in the early chal@@ k period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t need to use a lot of imagination to recon@@ struct it . if you &apos;re only a little one with the eyes , you might believe that he is sleeping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period was a time when giant Ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs who stood on two legs crossed the earth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , millions years after Bo@@ re@@ di@@ el@@ ta lived , the ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs was ch@@ ased by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it belongs to the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus one 38 feet ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long and six tons of heavy monsters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the scientists , whose latest findings appear in Current Biology , believe that Bo@@ re@@ el@@ ta has sank after death in the sea and mud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cre@@ atur was found by Sha@@ wn radio when he was in the Sun@@ cor M@@ illen@@ ium Mine , near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the museum , it is the be@@ mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs of the world including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hips . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the creatures had an average of about 18 feet ( 5 feet ) long and have weigh@@ ed up to 3000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long sp@@ ikes that ra@@ ced by his shoulders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers believe that the ar@@ mo@@ red plant @-@ fres@@ cos were swe@@ pt through the western Canada , flooded it into the open sea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the discharge of the din@@ os@@ cow@@ rie kept his arm@@ or in an exquisite detail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rem@@ n@@ ants of this special specimen are so well preserved , that the skin &apos;s most still b@@ umpy c@@ rank badges along the Din@@ os@@ cow@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preser@@ ving is as rare as a win in the lot@@ tery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the more I see it is the conf@@ using it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pet@@ ri@@ fied le@@ f@@ uses of the skin still cover the b@@ umpy c@@ rank , which carry the skull of the animal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his right foot rests on his side ; his five fingers are spread out upwards .
I can count the sheds at his sole &apos; .
in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A8 : many injured
heavy accident on the Thursday evening on the A8 : nearly 30 cars are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous injured , mile or G@@ aff@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Stuttgart @-@ Munich motorway ( A8 ) , some 20 people were injured in the late afternoon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the first details of the police , at 17.00 clock between Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen in the district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) were almost 30 cars , including trucks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no information about the exact number of injured parties at first .
it is about light to moderate injuries , said a police pre@@ dat@@ ory .
a large range of rescue vehicles was at the accident .
the A8 was fully locked in the direction of Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the direction of Munich , a ten kilometres long retreat was formed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a AZ repor@@ ter , it also came on the counter @-@ way to massive disabilities - by numerous gendar@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fire bri@@ gade were not@@ ched up the license plates of the vehicle , which now have to be charged with sensitive pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly after 18 : 45 , another second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a collision between a car ran@@ ger and a car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a moment that has experienced almost every one thing : nothing , one sits on the train and sleeps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
or is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buffer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes the Schaff@@ ner and w@@ akes up a lift , or pull the passenger in the middle of the workflow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ticket inspection .
but times of breaks are over soon .
the Deutsche Bahn currently tests the free ticket inspection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you simply have to confirm your mobile phone , ins@@ ulates and ins@@ ulates the ticket . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a test operation is currently running on two routes .
&quot; comes the offer to that we can do it out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next year , there will be many further traffic routes available in Germany in the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; calls the train the ticket @-@ exploitation without the Schaff@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be able to use , however , some requirements must be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and you have to have a online ticket - what already the most passengers do anyway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to buy it via the train , the DB Navigator app , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and last one needs a seat reservations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works so : you asc@@ end into the train , calls his ticket under &quot; My tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a button on the test customers will then appear in the electronic application .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ten@@ si@@ can get a message on their mobile devices , that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y Y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
comes with ticket inspection at No. Y he knows that there is a passenger with an already sold online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep further .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the railway - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you want to travel without ticket inspection by our train guide , check out in the DB Navigator software .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this enables passengers to make their travel time in train personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , marketing management board of DB remote traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; second Plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to go to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who often go by train , knows that besides se@@ clu@@ sion and missed trains , the ticket insp@@ ections are among the biggest sleeves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for often , in any case one of the participants do not have all the documents that you need for the recycling of online tickets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
either a credit card or a ID card or otherwise a document must be issued .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is endless discussions between train accompanied and passenger , which leads to a bad mood in the part or the delays in the control of their own tickets and take time to take care of other concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that is also only on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other tra@@ ctive numbers on the same route are not un@@ locked yet .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Britt@@ any Fer@@ rell was shaken by her core .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just one day after she arrived in New York City , the apartments sat on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , they rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on their phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they stum@@ bled upon a post from someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed 18 years of age , and still there is still on the road , &quot; named it there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confused , since nobody else had posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly saved on their tim@@ eline .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ra@@ pper from St. Louis territory was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns alive bodies , which was stretched out on the road and there would remain four hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is wild &quot; he thought Fer@@ rell .
but death was nothing new for her and her community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she made her mobile phone , later to return to twe@@ ets over people at Can@@ field @-@ Drive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were photos of the police band and people who cried , and by a man who claimed to be a sign with the wording : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police had just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you observed a live feed , where a polic@@ eman stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bar@@ king dog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , assured another polic@@ eman his rif@@ le and cried , &quot; I will kill you all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is not common . &quot; Fer@@ rell re@@ minded me of its statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder , where we have grown acc@@ ustom@@ ed to ourselves and that we can call it typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt ch@@ ills .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
they booked a flight back and went home next day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she fet@@ ched her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house , and decided that they would drive the next morning after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the topic of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; , in cinem@@ as from 11 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss of protest , strength and resistance , which is in the community life and filled the streets to demand answers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a Fer@@ rel with her daughter , wore a flower dress and a suitable crown to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation about the black experience and the black state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight ? &quot; remember what they said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not take her back . &quot; she said .
&quot; what happened today is a high point of what happened in the past .
it has to know and it must be en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also know the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to free ourselves to free ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if I have the luck to give you an experience with which they personally did not experience ec@@ lat@@ ty racism , it is no different than the next black women child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have the feeling , I would give her a bad service to keep them far from . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first station , when she arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , who was invited to a camping site , when the activists on the possible non @-@ prosecution of Dar@@ ren Wilson had waited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined together with a local business owner who made lunch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they prepared bags before and helped to pass them on prot@@ esters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slowly , a new type of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my activ@@ ism changed totally after 9 August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis as a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , focused on Essen@@ s justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
everything has come . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado Far@@ ra@@ r wanted only &quot; documented &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question came Fer@@ rell in the sense , &quot; Will you document or try to find a story which you can utilize ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these scep@@ tic@@ ism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often from white - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently declared in an interview : &quot; we had heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and grew up , they didn &apos;t cent@@ ered and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area dedicated to his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ ct occup@@ ants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his engagement brought the project closer to Fer@@ rell , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we speak , &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me how these people are displayed , because I will be presented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the goal was not to focus on Fer@@ re@@ ll@@ s experience - to show that it is not a mes@@ si@@ ah leader , but rather a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participant of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ re@@ ll@@ s live like they fell in love and married her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understand that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability during this work , and for the deser@@ ts of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Fer@@ re@@ ll@@ s has repeated the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ lives of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two of the three founders of the Movement , who have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in 2012 , identify themselves as gay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in executive positions have borne the movement in total , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
black and gay women must wear the main burden of everything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an voted to note , &quot; that &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it exists that &quot; this is not an affir@@ ma@@ tive type of action , &quot; when Fer@@ rell was chosen because of its identity as the heart of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was the person who sh@@ ook this energy . &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not acci@@ dental although she was on the front line because there was a black , gay wife so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the news pictures in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have since disappeared , but the ra@@ cial links between the church and the police continue to stand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pig@@ rell on mal@@ nutrition for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
it describes the soci@@ o @-@ political atmosphere of the area that calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , they accum@@ ulate in singing and she feels committed to this memorial since three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is our duty to fight our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love each other and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian area has been spl@@ its since the first presentation of 2009 , the people in fear and opponents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the subject hardly gets cold .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while one go to the bit Gallery : &quot; this would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) , or &quot; That &apos;s really great &quot; ( Nicole shew@@ ing ) , comes from the other side : &quot; does not need a &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ lows ) or simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the fear imp@@ lies that a gallery more customers are moving into the city , and those of the remaining shops fear that the pedestrian zone are bleeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added : the gallery will be planned just on the grounds , on which the farmers market stands , in which 13 directors are selling its products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will be concluded with the start of the construction work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gallery M@@ acher want to integrate a Mark@@ thalle in the new building , with the opportunity to sit outside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simone Room : &quot; we &apos;ve been buying almost weekly in the farmers market for many years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the women are always happy to do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also the but@@ cher shop we discovered for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we would wish that , during and above all , after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in other cities there is also .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; if direct market in a Mark@@ thalle in the gallery will settle on the amount of rent .
but probably not to be low with the new project . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what kind of shopping in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ e- or supermarkets : I find that superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is enough of this in our city .
one sees how many shop shops are empty here - some have been here for months and years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that we stay at least the Mark@@ thalle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because at least the product offered here is fresh and is mostly offered direct from the producer and is also reasonably priced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you can see , Lad@@ in shops are rented in a shopping center just by larger companies , because these rentals are often not acceptable to a reta@@ iler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too bad , special shops there is almost no more and that which is still left , will probably also disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a shopping center with a market hall does not fit me together .
and the gallery does not fit into Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the farmers market place during construction time ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution , even in duration , if the bit gallery actually came . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or does it create the W@@ rite @-@ Gallery previously , to drive all the shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that will simply not work .
and there is no shopping center which is empty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but thanks to the unbeliev@@ ably many - how I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg has no place anymore .
when the peas@@ ant market is broken down , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which almost imper@@ cep@@ tible to cables from the ceiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ stream and Haar@@ mann , who were sent to Chelsea Mann@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth where the former secret service analy@@ st had held a 35 @-@ year old prison sentence after they were admitted to diplomatic messages on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new exhibition , which opened on August 2 , is called A Bec@@ oming Res@@ id@@ lance ( A matching simil@@ arity ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline had been transformed into technology , computer science and art , whose condem@@ nation had been converted to Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , which has been created by Mann@@ ing and from the 30 portraits , as someone can be interpreted and the inher@@ ent determin@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations - but also to identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born by Brad@@ ley Edward , was convicted of the identification as a woman in 2013 , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the prison their image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ ined , black @-@ white Sel@@ f@@ ie , in which man@@ ing was visi@@ bly seated on a driver &apos;s seat and associated with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of their 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger V@@ isions &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this , the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette and chew@@ ing gum in order to produce the DNA from the tr@@ ash to make a picture of it how these people could look like . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they carried an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while in prison , and they wanted a sort of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and she could not be visited at that time and could not be photographed , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked them if they wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the artist and her imprisoned mice had become un@@ equal bri@@ efs that were exchanged several letters during two years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they even created a comic illustrated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o , which would have been a future fore@@ seen in which the president of Chel@@ ted verdict would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was released to call Mann@@ ing release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , since Donald Tr@@ ump leads war against in@@ forman@@ t from the government camp and against Trans@@ gender troops to resolve the rigid divisions that he should fix . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen from a certain reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a section of the gallery of written artistic statement , Mann@@ ing with their over@@ sized signature , among them ( the &quot; i &quot; in their family name , has been an end of &quot; automatic collapse , whose foundation is gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the opposite wall , its mit@@ ochondri@@ al DNA sequence is written by an exchange of Cs and Gs , and As , in pencil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hop@@ ed , showing the inclusion of the 200 characters ( or nucle@@ ot@@ ide according to the highly developed scientific Lex@@ icon of the artist ) , as amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological regards we all are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what people will hopefully take care of what we are and how they are open genetic data for a interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so are the 30 of these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last piece in the exhibition , reserved in a separate room , is a page from the scene mentioned in Comic @-@ Nov@@ elle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she shows Mann@@ ing , as she appears with a release of hands in the hand from the disciplines of the United States , such as King Kong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they put off your speech in the fridge , they won &apos;t say , &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; so never the mouth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote me , &quot; said the artist who greet you from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am still go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I speak about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing did not see the exhibition personally - as it was fore@@ seen in the comic book - but when they were supposed to do it in the middle of the space it will be welcomed by their own gen@@ om@@ ical simu@@ lations such as hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was also targeted , as everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , were written with the genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups with pencil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had her on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg said about the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement that joins Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind their liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford for murder
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a nationwide hot hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who had been sought as susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) issued an arrest warrant for murder of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as shown by Cook &apos;s district court of Cook County . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 years later died .
a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a common warning system was held by the Chicago Authority in Chicago , that Lei@@ che was discovered on July 27th . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; officials received a call , came to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim of several injuries to his body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead on the spot for dead , and det@@ ective investig@@ ates the bul@@ ks as murder while the police are actively seeking the two susp@@ ects , officials said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
L@@ ath@@ em is Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the Vice @-@ President for university relations , said in an email statement that L@@ ath@@ em had now been buried in ur@@ ur@@ ier and excluded from the campus of North@@ western University . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a criminal matter which is examined by the relevant authorities , and the North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK , in contact with the U.S. investig@@ ative authorities in any concei@@ vable way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statement added that War@@ ren colleagues were shocked and want to be honest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; head of Chief Communications Officer of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he demands susp@@ ect the susp@@ ect to stand up the authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of her place of residence , and our efforts to loc@@ alize them , &quot; says Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi told that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi told that police had received a call from building utility to the Grand @-@ Plaza building , which had just had a tra@@ verse tip that had happened in apartment 100@@ 8 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , it was un@@ clear whether the incident took place on 27 July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the sacrifice had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published a declaration on the residents : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and resear@@ ches a variety of motives , including a possible incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - the Russian Vice @-@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
Russian Vice @-@ President Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not last long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for rest@@ oring the Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a specific stage of fulfilling the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test it in collaboration with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the WA@@ DA timet@@ able was updated in this respect and explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the code , which describes the criteria for re@@ inst@@ ating R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Mut@@ ko he does not have anything to concern something for Russia .
&quot; everything was announced and everything will be implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , one of the criteria listed in the list is that the Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping Auth@@ orities have to accept the reported findings by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren in Russian sport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we carry out the investigation into that our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has collapsed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no public programs , and we will not admit what does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mut@@ ko &apos;s words agree with those of Vit@@ aly S@@ mir@@ no@@ v , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping Commission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with Russian sales office R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day S@@ mir@@ no@@ v had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping organisations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nobody ever tried to accept this report unconditional and added S@@ mir@@ no@@ v .
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 as part of the D@@ oping sc@@ and@@ als from the WA@@ DA of performing Dop@@ ing@@ controls in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is permitted to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following a visit to the main department of the organisation in Moscow , WA@@ DA director Olivier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has moved &quot; into the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ di does not sell any eggs anymore
they shared the business groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a pure prec@@ ari@@ zation , it couldn &apos;t be assumed by no health impair@@ ment , it was called in the message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from now on , only eggs can be delivered to Al@@ di which has been tested negative to be tested on a pron@@ il@@ able anti @-@ utter slip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ di wants to establish clarity and transparency to its customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Start @-@ ups , which will help your company , will not become the next U@@ ber &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Amy Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the surveys did not work .
responses were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and even when you promised anony@@ m@@ ity , some workers did not mo@@ urn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care company Madison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she called people from the outside to help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new breed of human resources start @-@ ups is at Wach@@ sen to help companies , to find out how their employees feel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the creation and licens@@ ing of software supporting the specific purpose of the employee &apos;s commitment , it enables companies to address surveys , Special groups and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to b@@ ypass the C @-@ suite executives and turn right to the Board of Directors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your business ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools is used to measure staff commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ ret@@ t said that she got a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t won . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the sna@@ p surveys and p@@ olls of certain teams , it provides a heat @-@ card of the company which shows most complaints and which managers can have low maintenance results , so that you can drill out why . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies come to think that at the head of the workplace culture , so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber which has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former company describes a blog @-@ mail describing those who have spoken , punished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t this desire for an overview of a lu@@ cra@@ tive business possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; global Governance , regulation and compliance branch could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion worth by 2020 , following the financial technical site Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

it also provides an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that can report bad behavior .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if the chief managing director is included , complaints are directly to the supervisory board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of Public Opinion recorded regul@@ ators , &quot; said , Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a company is found that his staff is treated badly or un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cott , worker @-@ fluctu@@ ation and pla@@ gues that Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , Con@@ ver@@ cent has been employed for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of the policy and procedures and have an easy way to reach their company headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier , if a employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to submit a telephone number or e @-@ mail for the corporate office , and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was often an inti@@ mid@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ YS General Coun@@ sel , said , there was no good possibility to follow the complaints of employees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , as the company imple@@ ments the company Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that were identified and addressed in offices in cities or states , were identified - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ fair practition@@ ers faster and addressed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with jobs , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who runs the risk management Group by Ruby Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment law . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies began to take ethics , values and staff commitment in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen broke through the Enron sc@@ andal , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right , &quot; that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and charge the company with recur@@ ring charges for the use of their products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a business model , and a chance to find approval by venture capital investors , who have supported both start @-@ ups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the total capital was raised to $ 47 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in November , he secured $ 10 million in November by Bes@@ se@@ mer Venture Partners and brought his entire funding to $ 60 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these investments are hardly surprising because of the networked nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is an increasing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees expect more than before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in competitive markets like Silicon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only inserts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees want the feeling that you will be accepted and appreciated , and that you will give your time a company with a positive mission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when people are happy to be in a company and that the work you do is worth , then , Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emp@@ loy@@ ee Experience in Link@@ ed@@ In , &quot; said both Con@@ ver@@ cent as well as G@@ lin@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors reach returns when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees work and engage in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the Analytics tools third promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the data about the employees of the workplace culture are important .
but the data is useless if the manager of a company does not take action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , if a company asks for your feedback , it may have a expec@@ tation that change is on the path . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if the change is not fast enough , or not at all , it can motiv@@ ate and motiv@@ ate the dis@@ appoint@@ ments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you ask for 4,000 ideas , you have to be ready to have 4,000 discussions , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , which companies have left to collect data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you don &apos;t follow employees , &quot; Hab@@ t you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about why , why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madison Re@@ ed , who has now conducted monthly staff voting , was able to initi@@ ate action on the same day when a problem over G@@ lin@@ t is reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and after collecting feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , she was able to re @-@ organise several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Ruby Tuesday , the company always receives new insights into the staff , and it hopes that there is a long point of view that leads to a better relationship of workers in a sector that is well known for tall revenues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and if you lose human beings lose customers too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose clients , you will lose companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the brood
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is on 23 o &apos;clock , when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A foot@@ ball@@ ers talked about on one side of the new training fields of the team on the campus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some have moved their tri@@ cot parts and show the back of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team this is a lunch break .
players who are enrolled into the summer Kurz@@ eme will return after the three hour exercise to their closing tests before they will return to the next morning at 6 : 30 o &apos;clock to the water@@ man Football Center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s for the boys the next three days a real pedal mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday to Tuesday became . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the first three trainings of the U@@ CL@@ A should start at 19 : 15 p.m. in order to meet the already completed schedules of the players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the compromise from the two days is more than a day , in which Bru@@ ins spent almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six times during the summer school in West@@ wood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you should hold fast exercises in the course of August 18 , 20 before the beginning of the formal preparations for their pre@@ lu@@ de against Texas A &amp; M in September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MOR@@ A said that he support the rules of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the busy routes of the player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they just pushed through , they plac@@ ken further , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think once we come to Saturday and we will have more time , it will really be great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the U@@ CL@@ A will end their practices , as soon as the camp finished , which has already been fitted with foot@@ balls from an adjacent car park and the nearby Lus@@ kin Center , which will be a protective net behind a Tor@@ p@@ fo@@ sten spatial network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brood @-@ players will occupy this weekend off this weekend , but Mor@@ a cleared that there may be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we will use our security &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think the people can rent a room there and then set it on it to record a exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have the video tapes of an exercise , it is quite a good deal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I am not so worried about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy Fac@@ ts in the fight against counter@@ feit news
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles by third parties to fac@@ simile audi@@ tors of third parties and then say the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said in a review on its website , that it is possible to acknowledge possible cre@@ denti@@ als and send them to fact , which may show results of the original article . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fac@@ ebook was cri@@ tici@@ zed as one of the key points for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , many of which believe they have also influenced the presidential elections in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with false stories being flooded through the presidential election in May and Germany , if it does not succeed in eradi@@ cate has@@ ser@@ ene post as before the elections there in September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement on German that will launch a test of the new facts review in the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the knowledge which stories are cont@@ ested on third parties , people want more context to make good decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook continue to feature his feature to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related Articles , and to other changes in his news feed , to reduce false news . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a Comic @-@ ROM : a castle in the history of England
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his younger past , the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a si@@ p@@ hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in 1970 @-@ 1980 and 1980 @-@ 1980 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has seen 700 years of turbul@@ ent history at the w@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now for inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ ired York@@ shire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone , who has been dead since 300 years , &quot; he wi@@ dens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &apos; A Castle in England &apos; stretches the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Kre@@ ie@@ wicz , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des that was based on an archive : he wrote The Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other News &apos; , a collection which was inspired by documents in the British Library in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have only responded to the thum@@ b print on the side of a letter that was written by a double victory in the 1700 &quot; s , who was working for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is its mark of thum@@ b !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and letters quickly sm@@ elled according to smoke , for at that time there was a fire because of the light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has a effect , as if he himself would be there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh , I love Archive ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for someone who is beaten with old Pap@@ ers , he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest ) it seems to be very nice to be true . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rho@@ des spent his days that the Vict@@ orian Castle to study the archives and the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle to study how about the mon@@ umental hy@@ bri@@ ls had spent on the walls and the bottles that the centuries had spent in the ditch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he mig@@ rated through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and talked to landscape @-@ care , gar@@ dener and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he drank a whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received full access only in 2006 when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a Rho@@ des a decade arrived in order to take care of the archive , which he spoke as &quot; hundreds of years &quot; in which ari@@ stoc@@ rats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; letters , letters from the time of the English Empire , cards that represent what possessed was , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought for the two families . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
guys - let everything go down ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to enter the English history , among them &apos; The lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who leaves a man who leaves the newly built castle in order to join the peas@@ ant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il that occurred in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book with the title &quot; Kni@@ ghtly Family of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rho@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peas@@ ant uprising began in this area and I thought , a insur@@ rection was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe the two are connected ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other stories are rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ rons about seven years in the English Reformation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell presented his own fun@@ eral ( a discovery that was taken only years later , when his sar@@ g was excav@@ ated ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dar@@ re@@ ll@@ s are Rho@@ des &apos; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gent@@ lemen seemed to be a bit of p@@ sy , ever again making debts and spend money for things that they could not afford . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men sol@@ dering their school@@ ers , having married rich old women - I set it as a bunch of well @-@ looking boys , with a talent to adverti@@ se land@@ locked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the end of its deployment in the castle , Rho@@ des on the search for other unique scribes experiences &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has brought a two week stay in the Finnish wild for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ men from the early 20th century , which has been re@@ demanded from nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back again . &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; Ah , now I have to be finished with the condemned life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign started : covered over 300 years old Mari@@ bo@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the unveil@@ ing of the 301 years old Mari@@ bo@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f has started its campaign to introduce a new roof brand ( Rundschau with Thursday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team want to hold the logo and the slogan at home to Nelson Art@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of August it will be a highlight of the campaign to give a feast on the island Gra@@ fen@@ ver@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
or ? &quot; we ask the makers of the action since yesterday on posters at Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel .
&quot; we do not really think so ( of course ! ) not really &quot; write it on her yesterday &apos;s web page .
&quot; but we use this measure to gain your attention .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and to make clear that many things are better than it seems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we are the firm belief that we know as bad Hon@@ ne@@ per citizens around the beauty and attra@@ c@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the action , it is more than just a logo and a slogan , it says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s true to form@@ ulate a single promise that gives the city a distinctive common element . &quot;
finally they are in competition with other communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f can be adjusted for a medium @-@ sized , double @-@ digit amount and costs for the campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military reform in Turkey - Earth &apos;s fear of the Army
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every year , in Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advis@@ es on retirement and transport sections in the officers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so this week also .
at first sight a normal operation .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the session was not held in the building of the General Staff , as before , but in the office of the Prime Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the chair@@ manship of the government , the five European Parliament and the Minister for Defence , the home , justice and foreign office were attended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was the number of civilians in the Y@@ AS .
the government draws to the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the commander of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the failed coup of President Erdogan 169 of 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and mir@@ als fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile @-@ Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erdogan as a wire fence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against 4@@ 86 people who have been involved immediately on the attempt of put@@ sch , will be negotiated this week in Ankara . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the day after the coup , Erdogan was called the overthrow of God as a &quot; divine gift , &quot; given him the opportunity to fully clean the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdogan really have the army handle ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet published an article entitled &quot; dis@@ comfort in military headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army which mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the repe@@ al of the head@@ scarf ban , wrote the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bulk cleaning of the army and the security forces will continue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mid @-@ July Erdogan ordered another 73@@ 95 sovereign debt , including 230@@ 3 police officers and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it seemed as Erdogan sh@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were formerly known as the prime lords of the country .
three times they gave their appeal to their role as the guar@@ di@@ ans of the secular state of State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after his election victory in 2002 , Erdogan urged the power of the military step to step back , not least in appeal to the reform of the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; former officers say , Erdogan pus@@ hes towards Islam@@ ization of the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; Voc@@ al Europe &quot; magazine , a well @-@ called officer , sought for asylum from persecution abroad before persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ af@@ ists in a few years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true that such development could not let Nato cold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyway , it exists in the alliance after the pur@@ ges of the Turkish army . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaders and oper@@ ation@@ als are &quot; weak@@ ened &quot; , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted from the media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it looks forward to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , more str@@ ingent regulations for the creation of visa for temporary work permits and restrictions for family oriented vis@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , save wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers , and will do this by exp@@ orting the US in other countries such as Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chains migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this new candidate procedure will benefit candidates who have English speaking the financial means to support themselves and knowledge that our economy will come to good , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted from the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to renov@@ ate track for race shuttle
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few months , over the future of the race sh@@ utt@@ les had been disputed , it should go very quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even before the end of the year , the route is supposed to be built on which the tourist road drives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to safegu@@ ard the future of the race car , according to the public transport information , the traffic was supposed to begin this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to order the circuit to the Ilmenau @-@ race track and to sof@@ ten the country especially for tourism , &quot; stated traffic state Secretary Klaus Sü@@ hl on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it costs approximately € 2.5 million for the repair of the route .
the country takes 75 percent of this sum .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the contract , based on which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country , will be finally coordinated , declared Sü@@ hl . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ministry and the south @-@ office of the railway as operators are already agreed upon the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the road@@ map , the vehicles and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; said Sü@@ hl . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this means that the speed@@ way shuttle can be ordered regularly on December 2017 .
the race @-@ climbing shuttle is an especially popular rail link between the stations of Ilmenau and Renn@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past few months , in the course of a pilot plant , the distance of sufficiently many people have been used to order them again in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the track is also heavily di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry about
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as you thought that there will be no cra@@ zier in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes . indeed .
sex robots are currently a big cause .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R we will start to take their ascent seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
customers can choose the eye color of the robot and its shape of the chest plant and the type of finger@@ nail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people are making fun of it , but the businesses can deliver a lot of it , and we will get them much more frequently , &quot; said Mr Shar@@ key in the release of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; modern s@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots using a silicone skin , which feels warm with conscious human reactions which can be reached by artificial intelligence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the user can also adapt its robot according to its beliefs , and select anything from the robot color of the robot over the form of ni@@ p@@ ples to type or colour of his finger@@ nails . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is still more troubled , as many robots have the &quot; person@@ alities &quot; who would look progressive with a Step@@ ford woman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern s@@ exp@@ u@@ cks have developed to robots using a silicone skin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the real B@@ oti@@ x robot provides for example its users to adapt its robots to the properties , such as a pup@@ il . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then there is still the Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy Gold sex robot with pre @-@ programmed person@@ alities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; which gives the impression of school@@ ing and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous personality . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy Gold has a personality , which is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the site of True Compan@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like what you may like , and you don &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the day , it also has its m@@ oods - just like real people ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , in conversation , or can be &quot; in mood &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are many distur@@ bing aspects on this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the under@@ ages on rape , if one is taking a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( i.e. here : ref@@ usal ) Far@@ rah , be@@ ef@@ ly one of the most . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on his website , True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy with a Vi@@ br@@ ator , but for men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a vibr@@ ator ? why can men then have no ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy ? &quot; it says on the website .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , these sex robots are not only a fe@@ tish or just another sex drive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its birth and increasing refin@@ ement indicate a little darker and deeper into our culture , to withdraw from the ideal of gender equality towards a wish for sex with submission as optional addition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most men are obviously not noticed by sex robots and while the FR@@ R noticed its rising popularity , they still remain on the br@@ ink of consumer culture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what in@@ filtration from the mar@@ ginal zones , can be in relation to the spirit of time , in which we live , very instruc@@ tive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many people are not stran@@ gely or ins@@ ulting , until they are free to use the free market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is a certain over@@ l@@ apping that these highly developed sex robots are threatened in a time in which the rights of women are threatened in the White House , which has ir@@ radi@@ ated women &apos;s sexual attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most horrible aspect of TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the hand@@ maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images that are swal@@ lowed body and the out@@ dated eyes but how realistic this vision works .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment it doesn &apos;t feel like a great leap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical simil@@ arity of actual women as realistic as technically possible ( even with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their builders want to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , to the point when it comes to their &quot; person@@ alities , &quot; robots don &apos;t represent real women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they cannot separate or simply go away from their companion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they do not have a medi@@ ation or a background , nothing , which hin@@ ge on independence or anything , which could dis@@ rupt her imagination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
expressed differently : you are counter@@ feit slaves .
or to express it in the speech@@ es of 2017 : ma@@ ids
Tr@@ ump great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the ep@@ it@@ ome of common sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has become a rush of the Tr@@ ump @-@ era that the political divisions , which have pol@@ arized the US elec@@ torate , also divided families in small format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around Christmas and Than@@ ksgiving , there was in the USA newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of f@@ ump relatives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we strict ourselves put in order to let our filter bubbles appear .
it has been less noticed the power of dr@@ umps and families have been put together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will mention this because my c@@ ousin , an left @-@ minded poet who lives in Chicago and has long visited this week in New York for a long time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it re@@ minded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful impact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House everyone who knows it , including the republi@@ can relationship , had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite odd on the same page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to bring the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it is in another context that this also brings considerable risks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the performing effect of his presidency has the power to put all of us right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the cre@@ epy possibility that his M@@ itt@@ ens of one day will no longer be rep@@ ented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is a still fri@@ ght@@ ful long @-@ time scenario , in the Tr@@ ump Repub@@ lic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alizes , which suddenly appear in comparison with his standards as an ep@@ it@@ ome of pois@@ oning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , I find myself from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax returns ) - which in fact knew a very mild criminal off@@ ences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Republi@@ can must be mentally healthy to qualify for itself as an im@@ measur@@ able improvement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to Kar@@ us@@ sell in Central Park , the largest of the Kar@@ le@@ ells of the New York Parking department , and the best three dollars that one can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass design on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are scar@@ ed and the animals turn around to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the cli@@ matic music conve@@ ys it in a strange way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of one city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings become old , the Sky@@ lines become familiar to provide much excitement , and the reality of the city becomes not just a dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not all over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage , the subject @-@ Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not yet - but a great round@@ about in the North of London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Central Park car@@ ou@@ sel is still a strange magical experience since two years of age , a 11 year old man and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and all have a great time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I could have made the Kar@@ us@@ sell , I would have given him full points , but fortunately no one has asked him afterwards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , I was forced to rate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coffee house at the corner of my road , it is the same as the option to purchase the rating with a 15 % tip of drinking - this to buy something about the counter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what is actually a neutral exchange , but also pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation which is not necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the poor woman in the department store exc@@ uses , while I am tired of the experience to rich my credit card with five stars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain moved from jail to hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us has left prison for a hospital stay for the second time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , he was brought to the hospital for the treatment of se@@ wed in his wrist , according to a case in his cell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence due to murder after an appeal of the pro@@ secut@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of the Valentine &apos;s Tu@@ esdays in 2013 , giving them several times a door of the toilet in his house in Pre@@ toria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed he had his girlfriend for a noc@@ tur@@ nal inv@@ ader , hidden in the cabin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pro@@ secut@@ ors have announced their intention , this time against the six @-@ year old prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , by which they say , be transparent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prosecution &apos;s national prosecution declared that it will be ob@@ jection with the Supreme Court of South Africa and the ob@@ jection can be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us runs danger that his sentence is increased to 15 years when the pro@@ secut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when Bauer finds a curious egg
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the last of Blum@@ berger schools , the quad@@ r@@ kl@@ ets of bas@@ ins and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen were released into the holidays and the secondary schools . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
three of the students will go to secondary school at the secondary school in the future .
school manager Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the Civil House Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a symbol for the dis@@ mis@@ sal , the 29 students of the four classes under the leadership of Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der became a young eagle who grows in the chickens , but then released into freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition the m@@ lower dro@@ ar led a musical with the title &quot; The eagle of the chickens . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and caused it from his chickens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of a chicken dish came out a small eagle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the hope of making a chicken from him , smote the eagle , and spread his wings onto a high mountain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
afterwards the classes were three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank showed a chicken dance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ eln , the cylinders worn to the bet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Eagle stands for the integration process says Schul@@ leader Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the young is different from the other young animals ( ch@@ icks ) , but they belong to that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose was to be free .
they wished each quad@@ r@@ kl@@ ist that he feels accepted in his new school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was followed by a word of gratitude to the colleagues , the former director Michael Müller , who jump once again in teaching g@@ aps , and the parents represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ch@@ ill @-@ time was over now declared class teacher Sophia Schumacher .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they only leave their students to class after two years , because it had been a really great time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally they could rely on the quad@@ r@@ kl@@ ets .
at the end all students finish a song from summer time and holiday time .
there was great pleasure in the children .
eight first editions have already been registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camp@@ ings in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the morning of August 1 , Si@@ th@@ onia was arrested by the police a group of illegal camp people , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same day , they were released , while an investigation is underway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the State Department reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Greek authorities have exac@@ erb@@ ated the control of free camping and lay everyone who is found in a place that is not meant for this purpose , significant money pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls are continued throughout the season .
the Ministry said that the Court can make a fine of money .
software update for diesel vehicles : what they need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
must diesel drivers participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers are in an overview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the diesel @-@ summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group has offered software updates for about 5,@@ 3 million cars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are supposed to improve the emission @-@ behavior of cars from the emissions trading Euro 5 and partially Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives insights :
is the new action mandatory ?
no . the edited software updates are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates only apply to the vehicles that have Schumann software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their retro@@ fitting has been arranged at the Swiss Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the manufacturers announced a quick implementation in the coming months , but not yet called an exact date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler has told you to write any person concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if any inspection is due upon an inspection , it will be completed within their framework . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long will the changes go down altogether ?
&quot; hard to say &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
the Cur@@ tains from the commitment of the manufacturer as well as from political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen voluntarily the car manufacturers do not act so far on the subject environment . &quot;
how long does the update should last ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time consuming can be it to get an appointment .

the ACE reveals to wait .
probably foreign manufacturers would re@@ tire so S@@ met@@ anin .
does a massive price drop of Euro @-@ 4 cars is threatening ?
the ACE feared that .

ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the glam@@ orous events of the Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to be politically .
one of the winners will not come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) gets one of the most cov@@ eted awards of the prestigious Kennedy Center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the cultural center on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ograph@@ ers Carmen ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman L@@ ear ( 95 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a reception and attend the award with his wife Mel@@ ania . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the L@@ ear announced with progressive TV series , is already announced to ren@@ ounce participation at the Gala . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; this presidency has decided to negle@@ ct the arts and human rights - even the resources - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed , they will use the interview with tr@@ ump to make their visibility clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the former president John F. Kennedy , Kennedy Center is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the former pri@@ mers , Mer@@ yl stre@@ ep , Are@@ as Franklin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we make the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Municipal builder , goes to R@@ ente next year .
the spot is already written down - but suitable candidates are ra@@ r .
for 31 years W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ et@@ aker has been .
and the work is still great fun as he medi@@ ates in the press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reports on varied , but also challenging tasks that await his success@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time it mar@@ vel that there is no application to be fulfilling the requirements profile .
the city is looking for the next possible time an architect or construction engineer .
so - under consideration of the regular arts periods - still enough time for el@@ aboration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Has@@ lach works for the administration of directors as a sub@@ ordin@@ ance authority , the applicant must have appropriate read@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
would they not be able to fill this out more then the citizen would need to advise you up to Offen@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the city is close to the city and himself , says W@@ acker , who is reported by a good company and good mood among citizens and citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over 30 years in the ministry , some major projects have accumulated to look back on the chi@@ pper with pride . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; he is assured of the building and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in future , varied projects are on the agenda : re@@ shaping of former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Lower park floor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pet@@ ty bridge between Boll@@ en@@ bach and Stein@@ ach is renewed and the stadium restoration is still subject .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter only will be@@ ech around 1.5 million euro , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all great tasks are waiting for my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
design is designed for a city building master in large play area .
with Has@@ ench@@ ar &apos;s own building yard and nur@@ ser@@ y can be flexibly re@@ acted in many ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; so W@@ acker , and the design of the founders are often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the old town is known as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have a eye for what if new buildings will be approved , emphas@@ ises the separ@@ ator Bu@@ ilder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyway the city building carries high responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is the owner , &quot; at the end everything runs over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with care and coordination , he can count on many years : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Building ) has been in operation since ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( deep ) for 15 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even though his successor is long , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; we are looking for someone who really identi@@ fies and remain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for continuity is not only important to a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the Roland W@@ acker might want to inherit a degree in completed studies as a diploma engineer or bach@@ elor with technical architecture , and above good knowledge in the areas of construction and construction planning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Building and civil building , construction planning , construction planning , municipal property with building yard and urban gar@@ den@@ ers as well as under@@ mining rights including monument protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bike on pipes thrown : southern route disabled
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the police , the previously unknown perpet@@ r@@ ator took the blue bike from the railway track ( B@@ 116 ) onto the lines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were so badly damaged , that the up@@ lifting capacity had to be stopped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpet@@ rators and seek after them for the night hours .
near the scene of witnesses had been witnessed a pink sco@@ oter and a bike driver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that goes far beyond a portrait of Lausanne , &quot; Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch said to AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpet@@ rators were brought to great danger even in great danger , and the train is also at risk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the damage on the locomotive and the installation , and the costs for rail freight could also come by train customers on the perpet@@ rators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a total of a &quot; considerable &quot; sum , the speaker said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the damage had been fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the southern route could be guided without any disabilities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost ten persons were cancelled on Friday afternoon and two of them related to the remote traffic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did not take goods , but had delay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch some 200 metres high @-@ ups have to be replaced .
isol@@ ators and ma@@ sts have also been damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help IB@@ D ( inflam@@ matory bo@@ unds )
red meat and chocolate can sound a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in flesh @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms of patients with inflam@@ matory bo@@ wel diseases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incur@@ able condition , affecting around 1.3 million and UK 300,000 in the USA , causes stomach cra@@ mps and blo@@ ating , recur@@ ring or bloo@@ d@@ iness , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while they normally advised to avoid meat and dairy products to prevent their symptoms , researchers found Tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an from proteins to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , stated that immune cells in the intest@@ ines make sure that harmful micro@@ bes , which hide themselves in food , do not penet@@ rate into the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cells which are unable to in@@ duce inflammation , are compens@@ ated by cells which protect tolerance and protect the body without dam@@ aging sensitive tissues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the balance is too far towards inflammation , this can result in an infl@@ amed bo@@ wel disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in experiments , it has been found that a kind of tolerance promote immune cell in mice is found to bear a specific bacter@@ ium into its entra@@ ils . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an - one of the building blocks of proteins - to dissolve the appearance of the cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial type - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus re@@ uter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ oma , and the development of a population of cells which promote tolerance is established . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an the mice had in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he suggested that the combination of L. re@@ uter@@ i and an anti @-@ tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an diet supports a less infl@@ amed bo@@ wel disease , even though the same system helps people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Post@@ doctoral candidate in Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan was examined by a kind of immune cells , having found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which had not been separated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they susp@@ ects that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ous mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , normally live in the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mice of mice were sequ@@ enced DNA sequ@@ enced , and there were six species of bacteria found in mice with immune cells , but they lack@@ ed the mice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mice were removed in a ster@@ ile environment so that they were not developed a col@@ o@@ stom@@ a and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells and they received the L. re@@ uter@@ i and immune cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to understand how the bacteria work on the immune system , the researchers let l grow in a liquid and then carried small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells that were isolated from the mice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immune cells developed to the toler@@ ating cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the active component was cleaned out of the liquid , it proved to be known as a by@@ product of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an @-@ metabol@@ ites , known as in@@ dol @-@ 3 milk acid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an in the feed of mice , the number of such cells rose by approximately 50 percent , but when tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an@@ values dropped to half the number of cells decreased by half . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that humans have the same toler@@ ating cells such as mice , and that most of us L. re@@ uter@@ i protect in our stomach @-@ intest@@ ine tra@@ ilers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not known whether tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an @-@ by @-@ products from L. re@@ uter@@ i develop the cells in people like mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an were found in people with anti @-@ inflam@@ matory bo@@ wel disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; The development of these cells is probably something that we would like to promote because these cells control inflammation on the internal surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially high tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an@@ values in the presence of L. re@@ uter@@ i can lead to an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believe that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Manchester United , with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , &quot; Gen@@ ie &quot; , he believes Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut at S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 40 million pounds of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin from the last pre@@ season game before the UEFA Cup @-@ Cup against Real Madrid starts off Tuesday before the UEFA Cup @-@ Cup as well as Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , M@@ atic had been excluded from the blues @-@ Asia tour of the blues and gave only 45 minutes to improve M@@ our@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve at the beginning of the Premier League season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we will help him sooner than later . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u started the start of the season as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the independent revealed this week , that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho did not wish for three more re@@ undertake but he insist@@ ed that the club already did a &quot; fantastic work &quot; to meet three of his four priority associations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three of four to get I thank the club , &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four , but they have given great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

new drau@@ ght for Martin Schulz - Hannover . we have a problem
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as the wind turns off : as Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD boss , the Prime Minister of Ministers still looked forward to Berlin with a certain concern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only no dis@@ rup@@ fires from the party central , merely a counter@@ wind from the covenant - was the most important desire of the election propaganda . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Martin Schulz has changed the pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , the employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus much ob@@ serving the events in the SPD @-@ governing state capit@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described in the approach with counter@@ wind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were grav@@ ings .
and one after another .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government looks after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Green Party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not be reliably , &quot; said the CDU @-@ Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber der editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aston@@ ishment of the Green Party , the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) has over@@ thrown a serious crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; five months before the country @-@ election , its red @-@ green coalition lost its single @-@ voices majority to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Green President Michael Kell@@ ner , the Green Party leader El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests , requested her mandate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the abo@@ lition of the CDU means a clear si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests must immediately return its mandate , &quot; said the Federal CEO and campaign of the Gre@@ ens to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this may not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the party leaders reached the party headquarters as on Friday morning , had reached the party headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan Weil , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands following the opposition of the Green MPs El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests to the CDU without their own government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the provisional highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD state associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ c began with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland election in March .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a blue eye , no more , cal@@ med down the comra@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the regional elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia everything will be different .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was done , though it was much worse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the do@@ ve , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite hau@@ led the party smooth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the weeks the comra@@ des were lab@@ orious again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then when they had sli@@ pped the new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and with it the next deep rash came .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mayor Ola@@ f Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD land builder , lost his Nim@@ bus in that weekend because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burnt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and because in the crisis of crisis , he did so pretty much that which can be wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then Sch@@ olz is fighting for his political survival .
so also Stephan Weil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the VW @-@ emission system and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on prime minister has already been in criticism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mi@@ ese conversion values came to be added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , or perhaps , because in recent weeks , because in recent weeks , because in recent weeks , because in the Con@@ federation of Ak@@ cem@@ ente . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the endeav@@ or of the former mayor of Hannover to expand his power in Berlin , did not remain hidden in the environment of Martin Schulz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they let him allow that because it was a stabil@@ ising of the party .
now the exact opposite could enter .
thus because in the part@@ um of the party the Lower Saxony has no guilt .
and Schulz not at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at times , the comra@@ des endeav@@ ours to keep your own ranks closed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their wrath is directed toward the Gre@@ ens ; and above all on the ab@@ dic@@ apped par@@ liament@@ arians in T@@ v@@ ests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is int@@ ol@@ erable and democra@@ ti@@ fying , as Mrs. T@@ v@@ ests in her own career of career about the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , chief of party leaders in the SPD Parliamentary Group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. T@@ v@@ ests has not been elected to parliament as a direct can@@ did@@ ac@@ tin , but on the national list of the Lower Saxony in parliament , thus the lower sax@@ onian dep@@ u@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Parliamentary Group , compla@@ ins a &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elec@@ torate of voters four years ago was clear : Stephan Weil said to the Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who conduc@@ ts the SPD candidate as the top candidate in the German Bundestag , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now the personal career of a future CDU MPs reject the election outcome , &quot; Op@@ per@@ mann said . &quot;
he requested to clari@@ fy the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further additions of the CDU Lower Saxony .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of urban development addressed Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ ind@@ ler again gave a look back on the events so far .
since 1991 it is available in sensa@@ tional san@@ itation areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country Baden @-@ Württemberg still took over two thirds of the funding amount . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the supplement was 60 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler the previous gent@@ l@@ ings are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to support the internal development , and not only to develop new areas of building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on April 4 , I received the information from the governing board of Karlsruhe , that there will be a rehabilitation area III . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the funding amount tot@@ alled 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which 500 000 Euros of the country , the rest of the community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how is a san@@ ction created now ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will continue to explore Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it also plays a role , whether in the planned field at all interest to san@@ one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
possibly the area limits could then shift again .
on Wednesday evening Martin Keller and Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal state @-@ country program &quot; Social City , &quot; in whose framework the rehabilitation would be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the core of the programme is the re@@ vit@@ alization of internal cities , improving the living and employment relationships and maintenance and expansion of the infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the measures would be objec@@ tively related to each property .
the rehabilitation area would eventually be defined as a stat@@ ute .
the provision period for the funding period has been running until 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , until September this year , however , a questionna@@ ire would first take place in the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in November or December , the study will be carried out as possible , so that in the next year , the restoration work will be started . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently stated that any Commun@@ e had to perform the bes@@ ought pre @-@ investigations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is therefore to evaluate the urban development of the city , and to decide when san@@ gu@@ ates and within what extent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there will be a refurb@@ ishment in the basic book for the respective land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann himself will come again to sensa@@ tions , and make a picture of the situation he promised . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Got@@ zel stressed that a major success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , there will be questionna@@ ires which will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled out until the end of the summer holidays . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionna@@ ire is the &quot; building and plot arc , &quot; in which it is about the structural condition and the refurb@@ ishing views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey questionna@@ ire , the &quot; budget and housing , &quot; information about size , distribution and residents of a room can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; factory bow &quot; can only be filled out , if operating rooms are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Got@@ zel showed that a fil@@ ler questionna@@ ire is not at the same time a request for funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
re@@ building measures are also not eligible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler stressed that the distribution of funding after the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; function - who first comes , gr@@ asp@@ ed first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can reserve no funding for later &quot; reservations . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; Ort@@ sk@@ iers II &quot; were shown to make a renovation &quot; tasty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor also sets itself a micro@@ chip to come with a hand @-@ movement in the house and car
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a British inventor is the first in the country to open with a micro@@ chip , so that he can open his office and even start his car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ b and fore@@ finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals that want to simpli@@ fy their lives with technology by its company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has joined Dr. Ge@@ off Watson , an advisory board in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the im@@ plant procedure is carried out according to medical standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the technology resembles a cats and dogs im@@ pl@@ ated micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company from North@@ am also wants to change the palaces on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for a cost of £ 300 per lock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the married father of one has now built both at home and his BMW Z4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the helm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the advertising cost of the White House cost tax@@ pa@@ yers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision of the White House , a marine helicopter for an event to fly to South La@@ wn , will cost tax@@ pa@@ yers after the data of the military , which were left to the TIM@@ E magazine , up to 24.@@ 000 dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the green white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the cent@@ er@@ piece of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and Chief officers of the White House made a tour of all 50 states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the helicopter made in Connec@@ tic@@ ut was exhibited next to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire station from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft truck from Mississippi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , after the helicopter landing at the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit that is responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted to be aware of it , because it is such an unusual event with a high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 , on the eve of the event of his su@@ peri@@ ors , the Deputy Prime Minister for Aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message showed that the helicopter arrived on July 17th at 7 am at the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 o &apos;clock , and so long remained until the lawn was granted between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the note adds , if the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of the service a second team would need for return flight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original air crew was during the helicopter during the helicopter , while the safety personnel remained on the ground during the plane . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recordings provided by the TIM@@ E were not clear , whether finally a second flight equipment was required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hatch Act forbi@@ ds federal government to use state @-@ owned property for political purposes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data sets show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could harm the determination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question that we ordered was , whether it was a violation of Brands Hatch , and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sounds like you are locked ... &quot; the Deputy Command@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event , and wouldn &apos;t be covered by Brands Hatch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the event , the president gave an impulse to reform the reform of health reform , which was underway in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated the efforts to promote government regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of the aircraft , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
President shall be obliged to use them for the journey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but to request their use only for a photo @-@ surgery , is unusual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in February , Tr@@ ump did a study when the Presi@@ dential aircraft was established in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages which compla@@ ined about the use of the presidential plane through its predecess@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is delighted with the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy press writing of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often lead training flights in the area around Washington and in South La@@ wn , in order to exp@@ ose the US president in the White House with precise Zen@@ o@@ dom@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a tr@@ ump from the beginning of July at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 entered the White House 58 exercises . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; event was one of the training requirements for the month , a civil servant said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hel@@ icop@@ ter units flew an additional 11 hours to this day for &quot; Non @-@ Presi@@ dential Supp@@ orts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers have not presented the burden for any of the other pro@@ ps , which were presented at the event . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said , the company was not involved in creating the helicopter on the South La@@ wn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 has no bud@@ get@@ ing desig@@ nations for the presidential run , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost for the event . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ tion of the US Ministry of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the DO@@ D Group is limited to € 24.@@ 380 USD per flight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
records of unity record flight time of airplane than 30 minutes from the home base of the Navy Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is ar@@ gu@@ ing that the actual cost for the operation of the helicopter can be far below this rate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers is based on the basis of estimates for the equi@@ val@@ ents , is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this estimates contain personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual funding . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , taxes for DO@@ D not contain personnel costs , but consider the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract completion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time the former press Officer of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , the application of the helicopter for the event . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present these week things , which are made in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the State of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that hundreds of people suffer if not even thousands of people are dependent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I think most Americans are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which many Americans have worked un@@ ti@@ rel@@ essly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is of course appropriate to highlight this . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it wasn &apos;t clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ ned with the helicopter , when he considered his tour over the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the White House , Tr@@ ump was speaking to S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky &apos;s representatives from S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the media on its own fleet of corporate products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very well &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC B@@ W Ne@@ uss before tricky task
leader of the Second World Tennis Champion meets the step@@ ping steps Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V .
the TC @-@ Weis@@ s Ne@@ uss will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Kiel during the Tab@@ ulated Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite having five games still macro@@ economic balance , the leader of the second tennis league has received the sense of reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
team leader Mari@@ us Z@@ ay certainly has respect for the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team who always plays in quite similar formation .
right on the back positions I find the team very well . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V , imports from the high north mainly worry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to operations in the Davis Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with View on Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ re@@ h@@ us ( all Denmark ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this will become difficult for us .
you also need a good portion of luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip in the high north is practically .
his debut on blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e jan@@ four .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , it is not currently working with the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fren@@ chman , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) plays his first use in this season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the un@@ occupied Chil@@ ene Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the White Mor@@ avi@@ an An@@ drei Vasi@@ lev@@ ski , still at ATP @-@ tournament in Kit@@ z@@ büh@@ el at the ball . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was supposed to be like Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ ow@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both the Netherlands ) and the Belgian Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after his two victories on the last Sunday against the club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could go back to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is enough for the 18 year @-@ old Hung@@ arians who was still the number one of the Junior World Championship in January 2016 , but someone from the coach around Mari@@ us Z@@ ay was the cad@@ res . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how America to hurt O@@ MV
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really happy Donald Tr@@ ump did not , when he held on Wednesday evening , signed his signature among the law for sanctions against Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his hur@@ ry to adopt the law , &quot; said the Congress a few &quot; un@@ constitutional laws , &quot; it was corro@@ sive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels sh@@ amed up against the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the draft hopes to be punished by European companies which help the Russians to build a gas pi@@ pel@@ ines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , investors of domestic O@@ MV , which are financed together with other European firms , financed the construction of the Russian Eastern Europe North Stream 2 together with other European companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the drug is enormous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , it may be too early for an estimate of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact Donald Tr@@ ump even has to raise the sanctions via executive order to life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
twelve weapons are elected to him .
&quot; the press &quot; has looked upon which the Group could crash and which could really hurt him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nar@@ cos Staff@@ el 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is placed in the center of the Hit@@ fli@@ x charts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars Killer , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is not yet over . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the season three and four were already confirmed by streaming service , the first got their first trailer and showed the latest bows of the show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the third season , D@@ EA has directed its attention to the richest organization of drug traffic@@ king in the world : the Cal@@ i @-@ Kartell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; led by four powerful p@@ aten , they operate as a Fort@@ une 500 company , with more government taxation and violent actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ guez O@@ ju@@ ela ( Damian Al@@ ca@@ z@@ ar ) is the leader of the Kart@@ ells , Miguel Rodri@@ guez O@@ ju@@ ela ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) is the head of the mexican connection and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the newly published trailer , Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Pe@@ ña , the type , the American and Colom@@ bian criminal law enforcement agencies con@@ stituted the war against drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry Bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the city is organizing the Kit@@ a @-@ lunch@@ time again .
with solid contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the municipal nur@@ series the clock will be turned back .
the City of Kre@@ feld takes over the care of the food supply in the municipal nur@@ ser@@ y facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , Deputy Head of the Department of Youth , this is good news : &quot; we all have very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is still cooked out of the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task , and supplies fresh boiled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city operates 46 children &apos;s facilities in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 children get a hot meal at lunch@@ time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past Kit@@ a@@ year 2800 children were sitting at the tables , and the demand grows steadily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are attended by 45 week@@ days in the kit@@ a , explains Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Deal is also valid in 35 @-@ hour supervision , if children remain till 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 46 divisions have taken place of the 1st September kitchen service : you warmed the food delivered , supplement them to salad , raw foods and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal , clean the food , rinse and clean the kitchen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a group of Kit@@ a . &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz .
the size - there are two group @-@ groups as well as S@@ eventh @-@ Gro@@ ups - decides on the circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now firm to the Kit@@ a team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz satisfied .
&quot; thus they are much more involved and it is easier to implement for kit@@ esur@@ f news , pedag@@ og@@ ical concepts . &quot;
for that is why it is about healthy eating and cooking classes .
&quot; the children should help to prepare food . &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known strength in Kit@@ a , a person who is familiar with them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important to children .
the pur@@ ge of kit@@ esur@@ f rooms - so far as the task of the kitchen professionals - is carried out by special cleaning personnel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen , it also has the charm between own reg@@ a@@ ie and foreign exchange for the city as the most economical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and this , although 46 part @-@ time forces can be re@@ setup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so strongly in the weight of around 750 people , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women and says the UN
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections can only be representative when all members of society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nicholas Hay@@ some , am@@ using head of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women are forced to die in the provinces . three women are candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of all registered voters are women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; said he on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choices can only be really representative and credible if women participate , and be included in all parts of the election process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afghan elections for the provincial Council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
the Taliban have released threats against a vote process that coinci@@ de with the transition from international fighting operations to an advisory role .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , the elections for the first time will be transferred peac@@ efully out of a democratic elected government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ some said that a strong role for women will rein@@ force the democratic success of Afghanistan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Afghan independent electoral commission reported that 1.2 million women registered with 3.6 million voters registered in total . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hike to the TV @-@ jubil@@ ee
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the occasion of the 110 year anniversary , the TV Kaiser@@ ingen invites to a small hike with connecting coffee and cake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hike will start on Sunday , July 9 , at 13 o &apos;clock in Fro@@ hn@@ st@@ etten during the reservoir at the American reservoir . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from there it goes to the air@@ field , to the Nat@@ ter and to the forest reservoir back to the reservoir . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hike takes about one and a half hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , in Kaiser@@ ingen there is coffee , cake , cool drinks , sa@@ tin and cheese . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

men try to aus@@ se 13 years old girl
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two young men aged 19 and 23 are supposed to have tried on Thursday , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the police , the men spoke the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who continued with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße , because they wanted to call with the mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old rejected the request and went on with her friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , one of the perpet@@ r@@ ers tried to gras@@ p the phone and the necklace of the girl . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the duo caught no loo@@ t .
the two young men later were arrested by the police .
the investigations run .
G@@ MB concern about investing in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union would like to make a union with managers from the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie on the long @-@ term commitment to produce production in her factory in Glasgow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB Scotland said , the company was silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 500 employees work in the work that comes next to other products hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea bis@@ cuits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis , in recent years he invested more than 5 million pounds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives are &quot; first experienced , &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the stores of the company G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s on , &quot; concerns the financing of production lines not to be driven forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ Organis@@ ator Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can win no clarity on the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers were concent@@ rating on the local community and the large @-@ area Glasgow , an important pillar for decent jobs in an area with high unemployment and social dis@@ adv@@ ances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and in the background of Bre@@ xit , the rising living costs and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow had urgent production orders at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the branch office at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter of G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to it , as we estimate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we discussed with the employees that we are working in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , our businesses continuously checked and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to stay competitive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added : &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , particularly in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recognise the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site fully and fully . if our operating processes are at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona have warned three years prior to N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the page of La League likes her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not stop in their persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar , having an offer of £ 189 million because it warned us three years ago in front of the world record . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sensa@@ tional approach has set up the transfer window in the summer as the Lig@@ ue 1 Club is ready to break the world record for more than the double of the previous brand where Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the past season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar is one of the world &apos;s most expensive pro @-@ sports@@ men in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500.000 GBP a week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious by the way that N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way to the outside of the Catal@@ ans , although the club has always given its best to take care of him since its arrival from Santos in 2013 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but was the football world warned three years ago from the PS@@ G president before this view ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di , Nasser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each club , who wanted to sign one of the best players from PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not worried because they are aware that when they touch one of our players , then we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign up one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , whereby the Spanish club showed interest in the PS@@ G @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti in the beginning of this summer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PS@@ G did not make it clear that it could not be allowed to leave from Italy in any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their prices for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sco@@ oters and damaged
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the night of Friday on Saturday , a well @-@ known perpet@@ r@@ ator was deliber@@ ately thrown off the sco@@ oter and thus prepared at the fair@@ ing of the vehicle loss of over 200 Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police Sch@@ ra@@ mberg , phone 07@@ 422 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for hints . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese seeks witnesses of the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because a car came in to his lane , the driver had to sof@@ ten the driver from a VW tour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday evening , the 34 year old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um had been coming to Le@@ ese with his VW at 19.@@ 55 CET . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of the villages of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car came against him on its road to the right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tour@@ an drivers touch@@ ched the model plan@@ er .
on the car was no damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the driver of the opposite car , a Mercedes Benz , over@@ hau@@ led a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the accident , it can be good that the mer@@ ced@@ driver did not notice the accident at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police now asks witnesses of Vor@@ f@@ ab , as well as the driver of the right to set himself on Tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 with the Com@@ miss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report dis@@ solves pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the mis@@ use case ent@@ ails Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and historian Michael Hes@@ sia .
the final report for the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Christian Weis@@ sen@@ ator , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are an exc@@ use from former Regen@@ sburger bishop and today &apos;s Cardinal Gerhard R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would serve to the reputation of the Catholic Church , when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would have expressed their deep conditions on their own om@@ ission or at that time wrong esti@@ mation of operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Vatican Council Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; on the other hand critic@@ ised that when reporting on violence in the sp@@ atzen with &quot; two measure &quot; I measured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Regensburg , no one knows that it would be hin@@ dered &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful deeds , &quot; but the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ eth@@ ic Committee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of signi@@ fying the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of everyday experience and preparing the public opinion that is usually established for normal &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Für@@ sti@@ n Gl@@ oria from Th@@ urn und Taxis said in the interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; one likes to go to the church and that is a perfect feeding . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , she pointed out that in her youth &quot; blows a quite normal educational means &quot; to be with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one , ready to become . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they fires it un@@ fair , present new standards on earlier decades , because the world has changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in connection with the reports about the mis@@ use cases , Pope George R@@ atz@@ inger often disappeared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely wrong , writes author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who au@@ tho@@ red with R@@ atz@@ inger the story of the Pope &quot; My brother ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says H@@ ad@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the outcome of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report , which was submitted by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with En@@ lighten@@ ment lawyer Ulrich Weber ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the early 1990s &quot; victims of attacks , 67 Cathedral sp@@ atzen sexually ab@@ used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final report it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can thus be used that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. can be applied in many cases forms of physical and mental violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially for high mot@@ ion@@ iness the punishment for the students could fall violent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to numerous other accus@@ ations , many victims still estimated the general humanity of R. and , in numerous cases , even positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interview Ez@@ ech@@ emann explains why the final report to the mis@@ use andal at the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger of his opinion was reli@@ eved .
Mr. Ez@@ emann , the 440 pages report on the &quot; inci@@ dents of non @-@ violence in prot@@ ectors at the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives a contra@@ dic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
for a lift that many students raise up his &quot; humanity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to another , it appears as ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which was pal@@ med by the Ö@@ f@@ teren to musi@@ cally have no top performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you describe this final report as his bi@@ ogra@@ pher ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Ez@@ emann : when you read the trouble and reads the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , one has to ask yourself , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is missing in it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is dedicated to eight pages , and he is clearly acquitted of any sus@@ pic@@ ion of medi@@ ator or black@@ s@@ wis@@ s in the terrible cases of sexual abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the non @-@ violence in the school was also reflected outside of its sphere of work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can do anything at best , to experience it late or have first clari@@ fications not taken seriously enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ m@@ na@@ sium , in which he worked , was perceived by virtually all respon@@ dents as literally &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also presents an excellent witness , &quot; called &quot; compet@@ ently , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; competent and &quot; understanding , &quot; that the guys are regularly stored with cakes , bis@@ cuits and bon@@ b@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only a minority compla@@ ined about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high mot@@ ion@@ ism , which also lead to whales . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he didn &apos;t only cast out with chairs and the key ring on the ground , but also cat@@ chy guys to hair or ears , he himself had deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , his honor of hon@@ esty has to be said that such educational methods were widespread in the period in the 1960s and 1970s , with parents as well as teachers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you still know such bree@@ ders ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , I think each of us who was born before 1968 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I also experienced this in a secular school , a public gym@@ na@@ sium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the horrible sexual abuse and violence in the pre@@ school , the fre@@ edoms are free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since one asks oneself if it is not more likely to do with his fame and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , so many media just over@@ threw him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Bavarian Pope , many who never understood it , still ze@@ al@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the truth is : the report re@@ lie@@ ve Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the media , in connection with the report a lot about the subject of mis@@ use in the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the Final Report as well as any active involvement in regard to sexual abuse on burden ?
Michael Hes@@ sian : very much no .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claims to have entrusted to the master &apos;s master . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never married to speak with my father or mother about it , &quot; said an acqua@@ int@@ ance for the others , &quot; It was all very embar@@ rass@@ ing for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real problem in the En@@ lighten@@ ment of sexual abuse was , however , is that most victims are silent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they don &apos;t even trusted your parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ orus of ch@@ orus that would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do we evaluate the r@@ atz@@ inger student r@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to abuse ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Ez@@ emann : a question@@ able student formulated it so , &quot; concerning sexual mis@@ use ... I don &apos;t see any case in which he had spent ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) and could have saved the desired cul@@ pri@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it ... even for really absurd , to assume that ... Bu@@ ying on int@@ ru@@ sive or more obvious or rather opened as opposed to their parents , boarding managers , trust teachers , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ th@@ ink@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; that in the run @-@ up concerned students and / or their environment , the test could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so what sexual abuse is concerned about Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus free to speak from every fellow worker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can him be cast out , nor be able to prevent him from being prevented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , there is no reason to get his good name with these conflic@@ ting crimes , as it happened in some cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the media much of &quot; Viol@@ ence &quot; was read in the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the previous domain master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thrown out in the report . &quot;
do he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Ez@@ emann : this is the big problem that in the reporting of everything was mixed and confused with a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of it Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this is again a mis@@ use of the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear : between the pre@@ school and the secondary school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and non @-@ violence , we say once , other pre@@ ach@@ ments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , the report covers events from the period since 1945 , also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral director of the cathedral @-@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire aw@@ ful test pedag@@ ogy , the cases , in which boys of sa@@ di@@ sti@@ schen teachers have been painful and painted , all in the pre@@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous states have to have been prev@@ ailing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister had nothing to do , because he got the boy only to face when they were already on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ y@@ m@@ na@@ sium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on that , like most witnesses , emphas@@ ise the theme of &quot; Pre@@ school &quot; tab@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was only happy to escape her , enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise &quot; states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what was different from the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ m@@ na@@ sium ?
Michael Ez@@ emann : there was also discipline but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in which the report comes to conclude that &quot; many victims also in@@ corporate the general humanity of R. and , in numerous cases , even positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so no more remains the accus@@ ation to have looked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre@@ school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first time 1970 / 71 , when he started to establish and responsible for the events of a school , where he was not working and responsible for the witness ) , and then again about 1993 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
loss Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in front of the stops consistently the ears ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Ez@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ ums which the report even re@@ produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this he pointed out the test that in the pre@@ school is still prac@@ tised . &quot;
in the face of the risk of negative media links he recommended that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as a test pen@@ alties too long since in Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before that they took place in a legal gra@@ y@@ zone like everyone knows of us still knows .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was hard to under@@ estimate that the suffer@@ ers may be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated or dra@@ mati@@ zed , where really the per@@ missible border was exceeded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but one can also not say that he would have looked at it .
this is just not true .
the test for schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria in 1980 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; princip@@ ally Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Taxis said , it is un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s educational standards to the time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you see it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Ez@@ emann : we speak hist@@ ori@@ ans from the &quot; Fall@@ stri@@ ck of A@@ im@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; the danger of past moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess is already right there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this of course doesn &apos;t apply to sexual abuse , who was abom@@ in@@ able at all times and also not for what was taken up in pre@@ school and violence against innocent children &apos;s prisoners , that goes far beyond that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is all terrible and I &apos;m glad that it &apos;s working finally .
but at the same time I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection because all this had nothing to do with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his resources for the disciplinary and Pun@@ ishment , so the ear @-@ cow@@ ries and ears , were widely distributed in the 1970s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as physical punishment it was banned then he has also strictly adher@@ ed to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is the picture of his rainy season , George R@@ atz@@ inger played back in the talks with you for the book &quot; My brother of Pope . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the subject to check out also for language ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Ez@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI tells his perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , I am by no means that he led a strict regim@@ ent there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this also has to be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism without un@@ ce@@ asing un@@ condition@@ ally discipline in Europe and of his musical tradition it would have been on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with cookies and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone you do not make a big singer and stand before every success , like discipline , passion and self @-@ over@@ coming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
than what kind of people did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the talks on their book ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Ez@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond that , I experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and always seen as a wonderful , hum@@ orous , deep and hear@@ ty people , from which one could not imagine that he could have a fly something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I get regularly with how many former Dom@@ en@@ atzen still today , 23 years after his retirement , visit him regularly - he is almost blind - and treated him as a member of her family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who don &apos;t forgive him until today , that he once was strictly to them , are clearly in the minority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most spar@@ rows are grateful to him today , so that he has enriched their lives and brought to them the world of music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that he always was a good , pat@@ ern@@ al teacher - a strict father , sure that it may be , but also a lov@@ able respect to whom she still likes to watch and honor them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and please , once again clearly : all you are prepared , are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we can be happy that we have overcome this time long ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is most un@@ fair , a man , only because he is promin@@ ently and has a more prominent brother to make the medi@@ al scap@@ eg@@ oat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is the bad intent that stands behind , only too obvious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the report which has just been published was reli@@ eves on him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the rising areas , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who would have acquired great mer@@ its and perhaps no one would know the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
