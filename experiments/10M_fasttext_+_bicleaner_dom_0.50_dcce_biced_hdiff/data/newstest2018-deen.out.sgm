<seg id="2916">"" "" "" "you can do anything at best, to experience it late or have first clarifications not taken seriously enough." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the Final Report as well as any active involvement in regard to sexual abuse on burden?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hessian: very much no.</seg>

<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I have never married to speak with my father or mother about it," said an acquaintance for the others, "It was all very embarrassing for me." "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2935">"" "" "" "the real problem in the Enlightenment of sexual abuse was, however, is that most victims are silent." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "if they don't even trusted your parents and siblings, then certainly not a chorus of chorus that would have been a colleague of the perpetrators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do we evaluate the ratzinger student ratzinger's role in regard to abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">"" "" "" "Michael Ezemann: a questionable student formulated it so," concerning sexual misuse... I don't see any case in which he had spent (Georg Ratzinger) and could have saved the desired culprit. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2939">"" "" "" "I think it... even for really absurd, to assume that... Buying on intrusive or more obvious or rather opened as opposed to their parents, boarding managers, trust teachers, etc." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "" "" "thus, the report comes to the very clear result:" that in the run-up concerned students and / or their environment, the test could not be confirmed. "" "" "" "</seg>

<seg id="2943">"" "" "" "neither can him be cast out, nor be able to prevent him from being prevented." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2944">"" "" "" "therefore, there is no reason to get his good name with these conflicting crimes, as it happened in some cases." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media much of "Violence" was read in the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The previous domain master Georg Ratzinger is thrown out in the report. "</seg>
<seg id="2947">Do he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"" "" "" "Michael Ezemann: this is the big problem that in the reporting of everything was mixed and confused with a huge melange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it Georg Ratzinger." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is again a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"" "" "" "it is clear: between the preschool and the secondary school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and non-violence, we say once, other preachments." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2951">"" "" "" "moreover, the report covers events from the period since 1945, also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral director of the cathedral-atzen." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2952">"" "" "" "the entire awful test pedagogy, the cases, in which boys of sadistischen teachers have been painful and painted, all in the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous states have to have been prevailing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2953">"" "" "" "but with them, Domkapellmeister had nothing to do, because he got the boy only to face when they were already on the Domspatzymnasium." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "" "" "on that, like most witnesses, emphasise the theme of" Preschool "tabu." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">"" "" "" "it was only happy to escape her, enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even" paradise "states." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Ezemann: there was also discipline but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "" "" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger in which the report comes to conclude that" many victims also incorporate the general humanity of R. and, in numerous cases, even positive memories with him. "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">So no more remains the accusation to have looked.</seg>

<seg id="2977">This is all terrible and I'm glad that it's working finally.</seg>
