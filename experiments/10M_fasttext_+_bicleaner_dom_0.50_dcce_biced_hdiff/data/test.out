28 @-@ year @-@ old chef found dead in San Francisco Mall
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping centre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brother of the victim said he could not imagine anyone who would hurt him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which was located on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall , was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gal@@ ic@@ ia from San Francisco , leaving the medical department in San Francisco . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the San Francisco Police Department declared that death was classified as murder , and the investigations are running . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brother of the victim , Louis Gal@@ ic@@ ia , shared the ABS station K@@ GO in San Francisco , who worked in Boston for six months ago as a cook in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ gh@@ ters Restaurant in San Francisco . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a speaker of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ gh@@ ters said that they were shocked about his death and destroyed the ground . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him painful , &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and our con@@ dol@@ ences are at this serious time at Fran@@ ks family and friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gal@@ ic@@ ia admitted that Frank was first living in host@@ els , but that , &quot; the things for him finally went uphill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found a place , he had a girlfriend , &quot; Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO &quot; shared with . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Louis Gal@@ ic@@ ia said that he would not imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a great heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his way to connect with his family , it was always something to cook for us to prepare the dinner , &quot; Louis Gal@@ ic@@ ia said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he never wanted to participate in any kind of dispute .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the river .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond that lighted a light every day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone , the information regarding the case , is asked to call the ref@@ using of the SF@@ PD under the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 575 @-@ 44@@ 44 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jennifer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;ll always put in drawers
Jennifer Ani@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
this was clearly understood by the Hollywood star in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will always put in drawers , or get stuck from the outside label who have little to do with me and reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I myself don &apos;t have the desire to be perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly I &apos;d rather sna@@ p these things . &quot;
Jennifer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh that they are &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; in the current &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; best of all , the actress sp@@ ends her time at home , pre @-@ tar@@ nished TV with a casual fla@@ o and mexican food , says it in the magazine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for white gl@@ ut she will bring the question of the children &apos;s desire : &quot; we must not be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hollywood Star . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new movie &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play &quot; is Ani@@ ston as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs with us from 25th August .
Gol@@ fers Lan@@ ger receives the Py@@ ramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of a golf club in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger sought a little variety with some colleagues on the beach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
Chi@@ o : &quot; golden sport pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after some minutes , the horses remember@@ ing their celebrations , they were hunting in the fast gal@@ lop of home to the food comfort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one kilometer at this tempo : I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and thus the riding career ended up again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer ever - 101 quotes - again near horses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was allowed to guide himself with his family about the system of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he s@@ wore not even to photograph . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the first time in Aachen and was also the Chi@@ o .
the reason was absolutely convincing .
the German sports aid handed over the husband from An@@ hausen in the framework of a small gala the Golden Sport@@ py@@ rami@@ de .
there won &apos;t be the sympath@@ etic ath@@ lete at awards .
Bundes@@ ver@@ gence , silver bay leaf , champ@@ ions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already spotted him .
long is the 18th prize lau@@ re@@ ates of the pyramid .
on Saturday he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award gave me a lot , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; for it is not only awarded for sporting achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been promoting the offspring since decades .
and so he continued the prize money of 25.000 Euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ time US Master@@ s@@ si@@ eger was added to the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of the German Sports &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ real Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander Pus@@ ch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke ; der Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke ; the Spr@@ ite Al@@ vin Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um the hand@@ b@@ aller Erhard mira@@ cul@@ ously .
many of these sporting events were met at Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the official part , the Swiss company emig@@ rated to the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ azza prize was running . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept the distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ ump Economic Policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and the trade agreement T@@ TP prevent - that is both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the two US presidential competitors have become one of the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the difference in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosophical difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep the doubts rather small in doubt , as the state of the economy may harm - with taxes and regulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton wants to face death and regulate the economy , he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he himself would be completely different , claim@@ ing tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will return to reg@@ ul@@ s mas@@ sively , and it is strong for widespread control reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton says : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , he has dis@@ adv@@ anta@@ geous chances and needs money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , taxes would be increased to the rich , says it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
interest@@ ingly both are very close to the issue of infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the need to be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton almost immediately say . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the democratic candidate in announces that the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies , and are rejected by the government @-@ critical Te@@ ach@@ y @-@ wing of the Republi@@ can . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so real @-@ internal discussions could be added on tr@@ ump .
significant are the differences in energy and climate policy .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and raised the coal funding in the US .
oil extraction should also be possible even in protected areas to cancel the Parisian climate protection agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , Clinton is aim@@ ing to expand renew@@ ables with its investment programme : &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want that we are . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not only with the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
T@@ PP and the transit @-@ fish trade deal will both not sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , both of them want to isol@@ ate the United States from international trade - just American jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should then be paid even better than the Clinton demands .
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a star@@ vation .
it wants to increase it to $ 15 per hour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what tr@@ ump is going to do in this question is not quite clear : once , he says , the minimum wage must fall , then he says he must not be changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the great discussion of the upcoming months should probably be likely to develop the tax policy of both camps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand stands tr@@ ump , who wants to lie@@ ve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his critics cling to him , that the budget deficit would be even greater . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , Clinton is at least demand that they pay more taxes , and their critics say , &quot; more taxes are not the solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
escape : &quot; every poultry woman has experience with sexual violence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual violence is one of women , who escape alone , almost everyday life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when they arrive in Germany they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house provides refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each one has a baby , that is at most a year old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one has put her little son into the arm .
he looks curious with big eyes in the room .
his mother star@@ es onto the table top .
until it not@@ ices that it is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kissed the little ones .
the scene works normal .
until you speak with Katrin B@@ ahr .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is the president of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social inclusion in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the topic of women on the run . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they live in Munich north in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for women , and their children in Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs has made the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich women &apos;s aid .
it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - either as visitors .
the exception is a watch@@ man in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated to say : any woman who arrives here is on their run with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are politically persecuted , because they are concerned with torture or death because their families will send them to Europe as a hop@@ el@@ essly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in women , other reasons weigh several reasons for the escape : &quot; many steal away secretly because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced labor , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continues her away .
on the escape this goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that tugs would require a bottle of water for a bottle of water , is not a rar@@ ity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the women alone are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who believe that the end as soon as they anchor in Germany , ir@@ re , tell B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also here women in refugee camps would often be considered as inferior and worse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this leads to about 90 percent of women living in the Munich north , are trau@@ mati@@ zed , appreci@@ ates them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of the children are not voluntarily surrendered . &quot;
many women were so familiar with that they say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the earth , because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since they often don &apos;t need to help , it &apos;s more accommodations only for them , calls B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria , seven district ministers are responsible for placing refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the question whether they were using a similar project as in Munich , in its jurisdiction , some answers with no . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken there are not something in shel@@ ters of the governments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in Schw@@ aben alone poultry women are not separated , &quot; says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press Officer of the government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Bavaria , underground and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken there are some community floors or own houses for women and their children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EP &apos;s rights and gender equality committee , &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the Committee , it is said : &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; missing the privacy or become women and women together , it may come to - for@@ getting - violence against women are coming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; above all , the shower room should be separated and accessible for women to be easily accessible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the women can feel the need of this protective ne@@ edy , you can walk in the rush which there is to the house in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has been talking about that we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could easily make a second house .
resident doctors : demands for new labor measures
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deputy Assistant doctors have called their union to appro@@ ve new operations in their disputes concerning a new contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has asked its entire Council to appro@@ ve more work measures from the beginning of September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the J@@ DC said that it had been a minister , to go to worry about the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
doctors and medical students have agreed in July about re@@ jection of a contract which has been agreed with BM@@ A .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the members who were released on Thursday evening on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Court said that the government had stopped to problems , what was rejected that the contract was rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering that the J@@ DC Management Board voted to fully reject the proposed new contract and requested official negotiations for all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an answer to the silence of the government the J@@ DC Management today set a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council , to appro@@ ve a continuous program of escal@@ ating efforts that begins at the beginning of September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dispute resulted in a six @-@ month strike , the first complete failures in the history of N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following his election to the re@@ jection of the agreed contract conditions , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana was re@@ jection of the agreed contract conditions that were recommended by BM@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings , which were still held before the vote by 5@@ 4.000 assist@@ ants and medical students that the contract should be adv@@ anta@@ geous and accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y H@@ unt said that the Treaty for Physi@@ cians in England would be forced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of external side@@ bands &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure which ended a crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday in order to announce the hands of the words and economic sanctions , an official end of the eight months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter@@ part in the gold @-@ plated hall of the St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es in reception , I cannot forbi@@ d that Ankara will not want this reconciliation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was a hit . yes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Putin &apos;s smile was narrow@@ ly narrow@@ ly and it sh@@ one hardly any heat , even for its re@@ strained relations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , Recep Tayyip Erdogan is repeated by his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin , according to a report full five times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not count it anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also promised , that relations with Russia would not only return to its old level before the crisis , but even better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next day , a newspaper described that Erdogan would have beha@@ ved as would never happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to me his enthusiasm seemed to be the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s shining and sustainable cooling shows that the President of Russia had nothing forgotten .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first what he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the shooting of a Russian fighting aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was w@@ ut@@ ured .
Putin divided and accused Ankara to put Russia into the back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the passing was even bigger , as it was committed by a supposed friend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cou@@ gh re@@ build again will be difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for months , the state @-@ controlled media led a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at once it seemed as if the Turks would have to blame for everything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most serious officials from senior officials have benef@@ ited from that &apos;s own family from illegal oil trading in the Syria of Syria , which will be controlled by the so @-@ called Islam@@ ist state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has denied this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in St.@@ Petersburg , the official message included that it was time to look forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , this meeting only took place because Putin received exc@@ use from the President Erdogan , which he wanted to hear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara the advantages of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire are obvious .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Erdogan is primarily needed all the friends who he can get after he has been reli@@ eved at a failed coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at almost his Am@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic moti@@ fs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian sanctions have hit Russia hard - especially the prohibition of charter trips , which usually produce several million Russian tourists every year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Russia , operators and char@@ ter@@ companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are res@@ umed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they count on a late seasonal attack on the Mediterranean .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this week , the Bavarian Ministry announced low cost of electricity and vegetables as soon as Turkish ag@@ r@@ arian imports are allowed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i formulated it as follows : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ankara is fur@@ ious on the West , since it has been considered a weak response to his reaction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the continuing res@@ ent@@ ment of the EU accession negotiations and Putin will come out to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship from Turkey to the west . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ankara , Russian President won a bonus to ensure that he requested the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat for the elected government authorities in Ankara . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is well understood for Moscow self @-@ comprehen@@ sibility that itself has a very deep fear of regim@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the summit meeting in this beautiful palace made it possible in Russia and Turkey , an analy@@ st once described to see the Alliance of external side@@ ways : two countries that have been rejected by the West and now f@@ ade away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still huge differences between the two . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as peace sti@@ ckers , but where Russia and Turkey support mutual sites . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could be indic@@ ative that after nearly three hours of first call on the first call , both presi@@ dents on the press conference had said that they had not once touched the subject . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the president of Turkey dar@@ ed to answer a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ise this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no clear con@@ sensus on it , where a common den@@ om@@ in@@ ator can be found to Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and considering the potential for a perfect disaster , NATO member Turkey ab@@ f@@ oss the Russian battle jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders will speak at least again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside of Scotland is no longer available
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the board of directors , the R@@ BS Group is to be reduced to a back@@ office role according to the board director of Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will not be available for customers outside Scotland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan , the BBC Scotland told that the R@@ BS brand joined the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , the bank has dis@@ soci@@ ated since eight years almost collapsed and had to be saved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during this time , brand str@@ at@@ egen &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have to be used to protect other end @-@ consumer financial marks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they supported the international sport with millions of pounds in sponsor@@ ship , from Six Nations Rug@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but now she has decided to focus more national brands in the focus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland is only available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the main headquarters and the stock exchange to move to Nat@@ West . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are other , smaller brands for private clients who will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B will be employed to our investment mark as well as the brand , under which our employees will be busy now , as we are now more to a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Bank itself became a global trademark , R@@ BS became the global brand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I say now that we do not pursue global goals but local goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each of these brands will be completely different in their own churches , and our employees will work among these trademarks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS already said that it will no longer run his Six Nations Sponsor@@ ing , and that it will increase the per@@ cep@@ ti@@ bility of different brands in its sport sponsor@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop to the Bank of brands , as we focus on how to make a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the board of directors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ical three years ago , if we had said we would have been a great bench for our customers and launched those brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can establish these brands again , so I think that the time has come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches its 3.@@ 000@@ th profit in New@@ market
D@@ ett@@ ori bre@@ ws champagne after a double at New@@ market that brings together 3.@@ 000@@ th gain
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured its 3,@@ 000@@ th British profit at New@@ market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he sat on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , trained by John G@@ os@@ den , a milestone in his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win at night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth Jo@@ ckey which reaches the milestone in the flat race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , Pat E@@ dd@@ ry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dirty winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won in front of G@@ ha@@ yy@@ ar , said : &quot; it is something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very happy about that with New@@ market , because I landed here 30 years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the che@@ ers to win the victory in Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two Jo@@ ck@@ e@@ ys met the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the pen@@ sion@@ ed 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record breaking career . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t the ninth @-@ time Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger had 4@@ 4@@ 93 career eyes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frank@@ ie is one of the best Jo@@ ckey of Modernis@@ m , and it is no surprise that he reaches this milestone , which reached only a few before him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has style and is strong , but it is its tac@@ tical intel@@ le@@ ct that differs from the others in the weight control room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s an amazing ambassador for race , his enthusiasm and Char@@ is@@ ma enthusiastic fans since years for this sport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already gotten 6,000 profits if he wouldn &apos;t be a weekly and big tur@@ ni@@ gh@@ ter ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Frank@@ ie has already made a winner nearly 30 years in the UK which is great .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a lively personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is a great Jo@@ ckey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone in a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flying Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the fig@@ ure@@ head of the British flat screen for two decades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was annoying .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a whole series of big tournaments , including its famous &quot; gl@@ or@@ tive Si@@ eben &quot; in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three years ago , when he returned to his six month sperm , he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his branches and to return to his order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he &apos;s still not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori has said before , that he wants to continue in competitions until his at least 5@@ 0.- years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian Putin &apos;s Deputy Chief of Staff - Sergei Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin clearly dismissed his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of the closest con@@ dens@@ ation of Putin for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed as a special assistant for environmental and transportation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Putin is said that Putin had ordered the dis@@ mis@@ sal of his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ a@@ ino , who was Deputy Chairman since 2012 was appointed as his successor .
V@@ a@@ ino , 44 is a former diplom@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; born in 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital of Tallinn , he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Kre@@ m@@ lin website , it is ( in Russian ) that he later was log chief and Chief Executive Officer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the main task of the government to assist your work as a state of leader in law , law and insp@@ ections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin divided the Russian TV channels on Friday , that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ a@@ ino as his successor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
convince the smiling faces ?
this step was mysterious in Moscow .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest confidenti@@ ality of Vladimir Putin and works like he for the Soviet intelligence service that K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ ca@@ sted on TV , both men claimed that Chief of Staff re@@ proved their own request . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in spite of the ridi@@ cu@@ le for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , shortly before the parliamentary elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so here is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody currently knows this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who once was appointed as a potential President , would like to lead to Russian environmental policy - ran into great skep@@ tic@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his remarks on Putin , which is cited on the Kre@@ m@@ lin website , Ivan@@ ov said , it &apos;s true that I asked you to have a very complicated post at the beginning of 2012 - one could almost say - compla@@ ined about four years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , I &apos;ve been chairman of the Russian presidential office for four years and eight months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V took the post in December 2011 .
before that he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin is a member of the K@@ GB National Security Service .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Putin to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people , whom he trusted in most . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once , Ivan@@ ov had accepted that Ivan@@ ov could leave his second term President of Russia as a third term in Putin to the constitution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this post was taken by another ally accepted ally Put@@ ting to Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became prime minister before he became President of three and a half years later .
Criminal Min@@ ds &apos;s Star Thomas Gibson was fired after he had produced producers
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last month Gibson was involved in a physical effort on the series of the series in Los Angeles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios who produce the series and announce his termination in a shared opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gibson , who played the special agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his termination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the set there was artistic differences and a difference of opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; details on how the character Gib@@ sons from the series , which follows a team of FBI agents , will be published according to the opinion of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios are likely to be published at a later date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who played previously in the Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Greg , has been with us since the first season of the series in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I love British Min@@ ds and put the last twelve years in my whole heart da@@ em@@ ut , &quot; Gibson was published in a notification made on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had hop@@ ed to be at the end , but this won &apos;t be possible anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans who can wish for a series only . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the twel@@ fth season of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28 .
ri@@ dd@@ les around fish that landed in Ban@@ ff garden
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a inhabitants of Ban@@ ff requested with the identification of the fish help , who di@@ ved in his garden in Ban@@ ff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kevin Ba@@ in thinks it could act with the 75 fish around San@@ da@@ ale , which were mir@@ ro@@ red by a fountain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Ba@@ in , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , Per@@ is@@ cope has published a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fishes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Queens@@ ferry Cros@@ sing : bridge connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; engineers have connected the northern deck of Queens@@ ferry cros@@ sings with the vi@@ adu@@ ct , which means that the bridge is connected to Fi@@ fe now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four resolutions of the &quot; deck @-@ blo@@ wers , &quot; approaching the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 cont@@ ru@@ gs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the building site Keith Brown held a visit to the construction site today , and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said : &quot; this is a historic and symbolic moment at the construction of Queens@@ ferry cros@@ sings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are all witnesses of the engineering of a truly epic extent in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel , which alone used for this part of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the link between the vi@@ adu@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a total of nearly 79 % of the total bridge deck on their place and the last part of the decks are in Ros@@ y@@ th a concrete for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Michael Martin : project leader of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure project represents a significant milestone in each bridge project .
the clas@@ p trend @-@ setting high and deep construction is the clas@@ p of this fantastic project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following the installation of the last pav@@ ement and its connection with the north tower deck , we had to close the gap on the North or the site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was reached by drag the northern tip bridge 700 millimeters into the south .
this was a massive and very delicate activity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; massive , because the vi@@ adu@@ ct is 222 metres long , weighs approx . 6.000 tons and had to be pulled up by about 3 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the toler@@ ances that the team are working , tiny - on each side they buried only a few millimeters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
luck@@ ily everything went very well .
rescue in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; happiness still alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; happiness still alive &quot; after they were thrown out of their fishing boat in front of fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI life@@ jacket struck the Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T Alarm , after an crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men had trouble floating in safety , while their boat moved out of their own power . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat in her clos@@ eness to revol@@ ted and set up the worst , &quot; said the leader of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck@@ ily , the strong winds have already turned the boat out of their reach until we left water , &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted from the age of 60 , and was found on a bu@@ zz@@ ling without a life@@ jacket . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they all arrived on board the boat trip and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water , have happiness , and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boat engine had a emergency stop , but this dis@@ b@@ anded on the boat &apos;s boat from the person who were controlling the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
someone has woke today about these men .

therefore she went out of the house with her partner .
on the road they met the ex @-@ life partner of the man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the two women found the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old took his sister to the side and hold his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who builds Braun@@ schwei@@ gs cheap apartments ?
the SPD and Green are : investors should be taken much more strongly in the future .
how do we react to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose nearly 1300 in the next few years ?
the SPD suggests a &quot; agency of living &quot; at the next meeting session .
but stri@@ fe is programmed .
first of all about the question : who should build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S &amp; D Group President Christoph Brat@@ mann , &quot; we are pleased with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build urban areas in future , will have to exhibit 20 percent of all apartments as a social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the favorable apartments can also develop in stock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the major dispute in the town hall is , however , said : &quot; how do you want to build investors based on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors in such areas at least 10 percent , but as possible 20 percent of apartments build as a social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new urban housing programme , which will cost millions and will be financed for incen@@ tives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the problem so viol@@ mann : &quot; there is still no agreement between the fra@@ ctions . &quot;
the CDU would like to make investors as few prescri@@ ptions as possible .
the left will@@ s still want hard@@ ship editions for investors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regardless of , so viol@@ mann , a mer@@ ging of the situation in the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
will the scope of action be implemented and will ensure additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we get the experts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yet the program does not fully say : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but how does one compare the loss of further around 1300 cheap apartments , whose promotion is running over the next few years ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to prevent this , the planning policy Nicole Palm , should now be purchased from the city now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , it would have to be thought to get back to the price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is possible in the West city .
one stroke would solve the problem .
because in the West city there is the end of the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments you could get back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : the owners who don &apos;t want the housing corporations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the number of social housing in the West city is dras@@ tically increased , one removes itself from the goal of the so @-@ called continuous mix . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there should be no more concentration of social weak in just a few neighbor@@ hoods .
the Green Party mean that there will be any movement in the discussion .
S &amp; D Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke said : &quot; for a wide majority the CDU must be with the boat . &quot;
they focused on more building sites for family homes .
but what does not mean that yet a compromise can be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to look like the world has changed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that teenagers and child to play no longer go out , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time , on screens for rigid , was lam@@ ented in the last decade of many . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Pok@@ em@@ on Go , it &apos;s about to get people from the sofa and let it be more active . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the time on the screen was originally limited to the TV and then limited to video games and on smartphones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and activities do not exclu@@ de each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am referring to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn of course , an app that was initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later it came from a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as many phenomena of pop culture sun@@ k the interest in the release of the game in the US , Australia and New Zealand in early July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the market launch in other countries has been shifted by massive demand , which over@@ loaded the server . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon had more than T@@ wins and nearly as many as Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in short , the players go outside and search for Pok@@ é@@ mons who were tra@@ pped with a GPS once they were found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( about a screenshot on the phone ) or caught . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a generation that played the game when she was still younger , she turned and jump@@ ed for the sofa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the US , the game led to a significant rise in steps which the &quot; average &quot; person returns every day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cardi@@ ac , an app for Apple Watch that followed by 3@@ 5.000 user , shared by Washington Post that within two days following the launch of the game , the number of people responded by 45 per cent to 53 percent every day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company does not know who is playing Pok@@ é@@ mon go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns for the health , the people want to take &quot; take 30 minutes to come , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; walk on de@@ af ears because many public messages come to the health and come from people who look like . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless the importance of sports can not be assessed over@@ rated .
who regularly drives sport and reduces his chances to get sick of cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the wonder@@ full of Pok@@ é@@ mon go is , that it brings people to do something outdoors , making them fun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people even close new friends .
as always there are m@@ ür@@ ric players that have to compla@@ in about something .
and yes somebody could run against a door .
what is it supposed to do ?
a breakthrough has happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit have already been able to pursue our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to play sports as it does . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new will lose its appeal , and the use will stop using time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , because of Pok@@ em@@ on success , there will be more games to be united with apps and virtual reality in the real world and helping people on the hunt will be more active , more active , f@@ itter and health@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

and now the Olympic Champion at last .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ ast created the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of the spotlight at the Olympic Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their overall score of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; Mann@@ ing clas@@ sm@@ in A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the American veter@@ ans Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the pig bal@@ ken during the solo concerts during the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American player who wins a multi@@ player title and a total of fifth , while they strengthen their reputation , the best of their generation or even at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she broke out in tears , when her end result was shown and her long journey took place at that moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this success puts it in the same league like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years its sport for the last three years - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that it &apos;s a mixture of am@@ bition and precision that she &apos;s &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast ever I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they expected a final test in Brazil , a competition that didn &apos;t work so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of athletes but rather between her and a load over@@ sized expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not with a hand@@ ful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be regarded as dis@@ appointment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the American veter@@ ans Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ cing the women of gold and silver in the sol@@ en@@ oid of women at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served in the farewell ceremony to retired Mann@@ i co @-@ ordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i as a call@@ sign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even though Bil@@ bao was insist@@ ing on the top , never to have the future planned , that is not really true . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; part of their ground exercises - which contain its typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tailored to Latin American music , which would fit at home outside the Olympic arena in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not a co@@ incidence .
this girl who was adopted by her grand@@ parents as a little child and was discovered by the trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school leaving in the Bo@@ or@@ man trained .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the summer of 2013 , she hasn &apos;t lost any additional competition , a victory series that will stop as long as it wishes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even if Mu@@ staf@@ ina led slightly due to two turns light the image dec@@ ei@@ ves the image .
pig @-@ beams and ground loops - in which Bil@@ es keeps the world champion - loud .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they returned again with 15.@@ 4@@ 33 on the pig , and sat on the ground with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her as she waited her grand@@ stand - a pure form@@ ality - and tears flow@@ ed on bil@@ es glossy red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner when the vision , who once was described in their collective book , to reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was an reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Mu@@ staf@@ ina . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this time the 22 @-@ year old man escap@@ ist , who is called &quot; Grand@@ ma , &quot; is a ledge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after their ground exercise , she threw the audience of Turkey , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback which sometimes appeared dou@@ bt@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of this week , the 19 @-@ year old twe@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a very new meaning : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
police : 3 victims in mass mur@@ der@@ ers shot during the music .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to police report published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were shot that were killed in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade in the car , listening to music and heard music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot during the car in a dri@@ ve@@ way , said the authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the do@@ ers fired eight shots from a hand fire@@ arm while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , is in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police shared that the thre@@ e@@ fold murder would not have been the result of a rob@@ ber , because the att@@ acker did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who were in possession of one of the adult victims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police pre@@ press of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting was directed to a closer look , whether they are linked with four previous attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , seven people were killed in h@@ is@@ panic living objects within four months , and two others were injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; Howard der K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is believed that susp@@ ects several vehicles , including one brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investig@@ ators refused to dis@@ close the evidence that they have been linked to the conclusion , and the attacks were committed to the same mur@@ derer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
El@@ lis , 33 and was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a witness shared the police , that it was not unusual for her to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which turned on an empty Pick@@ up truck to a thre@@ e@@ fold murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ age and make a bul@@ let from the seat and ball fragments from the engine room .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia : &quot; it is better &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old , Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves the singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but like the least of his age , Edmund micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , did not know about his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during their pregnancy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he came home the first time , my first thought I could not create this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I do not create this .
I did not leave on that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is not right at all -- of course , one has left on it , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Vincent , and her husband told that Edmund could never see them under circumstances and that he may not even survive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some doctors even went so far , they struck Him to institutional him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; my first answer was &apos; I did not know that people are still doing &apos; . &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Edmund can run with help of a help .
Edmund could neither sit nor cra@@ ck@@ le up to his third year of life and he can still not speak .
but it makes progress slowly .
he can run and cycling with support .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth is showing the sign language that Edmund Optics for &quot; Please feel something out of &quot; thought out . &quot;
&quot; we will tell him sign language &quot; and told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but there is no typical sign language -- it says . Edmund invented some notes alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as at Edmund and infections with viruses , like meas@@ les or the z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus during pregnancy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is still too soon to say , how life will affect the life of the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional value of an uncertain future .
I asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not been asked for a long time after the forecast , because I did not expect that someone can really say to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has caused a hop@@ eful advice for mothers from babies with birth damage caused by z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
it will be better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
unusually heavy rain falls - there are inci@@ dents on rescue in Louisiana , Mississippi
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sharp rainfall and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Louisiana are forced to call the governor on Friday , on Friday . it will be counted the entire Saturday with more rainf@@ alls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; numerous rivers in the south @-@ east Lou@@ isi@@ anas and the south of the Mississi@@ pp@@ is flooded their banks and threatened with large @-@ scale floo@@ ding to extreme rainfall , reported the national weather . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the governor of Louisiana John B@@ el Edwards shared with that state officials , in constant contact with the local authorities , and help the communities already on the way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a speaker for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ edness of the Govern@@ ors , shared the en@@ quiries for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ste@@ ele said that only the church of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a had requested ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used across wide parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ anas and Saturday .
the weather service was silent that in this region additional 3 to 5 inches could fall to rain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , Al@@ ab@@ &apos;s was on Friday a flood warning system , while in the area of Mobile it was still ra@@ ining . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flooded so many houses in the suburbs near Bat@@ on Rouge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also said that a flood @-@ directed flood in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , since it only slowly flow into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the river Tick@@ fa@@ w , south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool , Louisiana , reached the highest level at 09.@@ 00 on Friday , which was ever recorded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ans@@ ford , 62 , says that water of Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , rise overnight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that another step@@ son , who dw@@ ells in the proximity , warned him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we woke up and the water flow@@ ed and stre@@ amed in . &quot; said H@@ ans@@ ford .
it reached my wa@@ ist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his wife said H@@ ans@@ ford that she had lived there in the 48 years , in which she had never seen such a plateau of the river . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ans@@ ford told that he and his family members would have all the disabilities and he could have the only one that can swim .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that Emer@@ hel@@ pers would have saved all three in a big military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster where they were housed up to Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the flood had stretched out fast , because there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities would consider evacuation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , a ob@@ server reported close to Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning by 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities gave notice that heavy rainf@@ alls and roads flooded the salvation of inhabitants from their houses in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a Par@@ ish and teaching out in five school districts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a third @-@ flooded houses were flooded in tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a 200 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches , which were both flooded and flooded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ruler of the commune of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities were saved 72 people and seven pets , that were washed from flood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set to accommodate the ev@@ acu@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the water starts to go back , they will return to their houses , &quot; said he . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the city of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a , almost two dozens of streets were closed to the residents who hope to keep the water from their houses and shops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last major flood which we had , was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the municipal government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mississi@@ pp , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Harrison , said that it continues to rain on the Gulf Coast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to his details , a hand@@ ful of hand@@ ful houses were report@@ edly been reported as the flooded , but on Friday it has not been reported until now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Keith Town@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places where I have never seen before , &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; and it &apos;s still coming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 &quot; Pe@@ aks out of bul@@ lets &quot; survived shooting in Philadelphia
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police shares that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was s@@ laugh@@ tered in Philadelphia , this week already has shot a 6 year old child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him to C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grand@@ parents gave notice that Brown was inj@@ ected several leg injuries including in the lo@@ oming , leg , arm and belly , but that he was at his transport to the hospital at consciousness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has made a lot , his small body was en@@ chan@@ ted from bul@@ lets , &quot; his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ex@@ z shared the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just can &apos;t believe it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the condition of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital , and he had to undergo several operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boy &apos;s family divided the transmitter to the transmitter , that he is likely to be pu@@ zz@@ led again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he should have started the first class in a local primary school .
Brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three men were also shot , two at the age of 29 and a 32 year old man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are lou@@ dly , according to C@@ BS Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , which is found in a critical condition , reported on the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the other two victims were not in the car and the police are determined , whether one of the injured men of the perpet@@ rators could be found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia with that it seems that it seems to be a fire fire between several sho@@ oters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pat@@ rons from the assault rif@@ les , which were tra@@ ced back to various assault rif@@ les , over@@ se@@ wn the scene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it seems that it clearly acted for a continual struggle .
on the road on both sides of the walk@@ way were located .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , there have been several armed fighters who were very active there , divided the police officer Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di to the police in Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were also several homes and vehicles met in the area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came to no celebration , and the police currently checks reports according to the monitoring video . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a tor@@ ship , when she played in front of her house in the area of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they re@@ covering , and the police are looking for a susp@@ ect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I imagine under the olymp@@ i@@ am@@ ann@@ ie in the ship and this for more than one reason .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , I joined every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA were never so dominant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and second : this team has three Tur@@ ner@@ gies , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren , Lau@@ rie . Her@@ nan@@ dez , which inspired many young girls of other skin color inspiring . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din is and Madison Ko@@ cian , the Catho@@ lic@@ in , makes everyone proud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this team finally reflects the US .
it has strengthened the black and h@@ is@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past four years , number one had one Af@@ ro @-@ Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year was Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
that shows strength .
Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising number of Olympi@@ ans and America during the last Olympics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three @-@ fold world champion in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they were unexpected , but master@@ ful gym@@ n@@ tik@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , Simone was elected the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American who won an individual majority stake for women Gold . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are experiencing the tip of this sport , but they don &apos;t see sport classes in the whole country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all hit the same way as A@@ ly and Madison to join the Olympic Team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last five stars , because the next Olympi@@ ad will have only four Tur@@ ner@@ gies in the team . furthermore , this was the last year featuring Marta Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but reality is like that Tur@@ ns will be an expensive sport and Turner first take up in private turn@@ tables , which come up by parents who take care of your training , training , travel and hotel costs ( for the coaches and their Turner and families ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the majority of these turn@@ tables are located in wealthy suburbs that can support the shop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these clubs , the Turner has got its entire training and this is a dev@@ otion and long @-@ term commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both her athletes since they had begun with Tur@@ nen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to insp@@ ect the churches of Au@@ n , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a great and easier access training . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I founded my Turn@@ table 20 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for my events , we have offered free and affordable tower in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trains national and international winners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my hometown ) to offer the youth of high @-@ quality tur@@ nes that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tur@@ ns develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determin@@ at@@ eness for the mind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this combination offers lifel@@ ong advantages for health as well as for the school@@ ing and professional success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the inspiration of this team , which bring thousands of young girls to interest to the tur@@ f and that &apos;s great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is so important to participate in sport especially for girls .
it is such an exciting time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by bringing so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to start healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
doctors want to organize more strikes after they have rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts proposal
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the argument over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the functioning of the British Medical Association , but 58 per cent of the 3@@ 7.000 assist@@ ants accepted him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in July , H@@ unt &apos;s plans were revealed to nom@@ inate the contract and said that N@@ HS would be in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and that any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first assist@@ ants are to receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the president of the BM@@ A Com@@ intern for assist@@ ants have told the proposed contract after serious concerns , especially that it will be able to deal with the current workforce crisis and to treat all physi@@ cians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only eight weeks left to stay , until the first group of doctors will fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; efforts from the BM@@ A to resolve disputes in the government , and sometimes on ear @-@ de@@ stunning silence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this happened during a promise that Jerem@@ y H@@ unt had done in the last month , that his door was always open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Jerem@@ y H@@ unt has now to act now to raise the suspension and address the wor@@ ries of the assist@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he does not do this , the doctors have made clear that they are ready to perform additional labour measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a supply of nearly 13@@ ,000 routines and 100.000 appointment to grant doctors in the strike chain coverage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the argument over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ A would like to re@@ pay a better week of week for the 5@@ 4.000 Assistance , which shall be subject to the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , CEO of the N@@ HS employees , called for the assist@@ ants to end the strike . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; labour measures can achieve nothing of the only little , but already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patients , care and their families only concerns , emergency and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past two months , we talked with the Ministry of Health and with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries followed a positive response to the concerns regarding pre@@ m@@ und@@ ries and the W@@ hist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; employers hop@@ ed that continued positive commitment to other major topics - such as posting , flexibility at training , training days , and gender equality , as seriously it was the employer , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health in compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the £ 2 pro Tag@@ - drug that can reduce the heart attack of heart disease
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 per day drug after receiving the authorities for a longer period of time .
the medicine t@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with a reduction of heart disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the medication is administered after a heart attack for 12 months , thereby reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ HS regul@@ ators ( N@@ HS ) has recommended a four @-@ year dose to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regul@@ ators ( N@@ HS ) has recommended a four @-@ year dose to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and one quarter of it suffer another heart attack or stroke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accumulation of gre@@ asy material into the arter@@ ial walls that form the har@@ ass@@ le .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the layer breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ause to c@@ logged the blood flow up to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the blood cl@@ ots trig@@ gers , it can flow through blood flow and c@@ logged the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persons , who had already had a heart attack , are subject to a higher risk of another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ ec@@ a , is driven by the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by causing the formation of blood cl@@ ots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entry design of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with an twice daily intake of asp@@ ir@@ in for the next three years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Assessment Center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who have suffered a heart attack or stroke - often with distill@@ ing consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with A@@ spir@@ in effectively in reducing other heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who had already had a heart attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through a preliminary recommendation by T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the information on efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the blood risk - is limited to a period of up to three years , no treatment that goes beyond this period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ness lets election blo@@ om in Muslim areas
former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed from the ministry last year due to corruption of a government report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ness has caused that widespread suff@@ rage in Muslim communities were ignored like a crus@@ hing government report today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Cab@@ inet of Sir Eric Pic@@ kles , verb@@ ally , attacks the police , election observation and Rath@@ usi@@ ans because of &quot; survi@@ vals &quot; of eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former minister of Integration and municipal government , who is now a ant@@ acid scale , said that the inti@@ mid@@ ation of voters from religious motives should be said that it should be authorised to protect the police outside of election cabins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that voters should carry out a ID to prove their identity , in order to prove their identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the moment a voters must name merely his name and address .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report proposes not to remove remote ink on the fingers of a person if they give her elec@@ tive voice , to prevent any one should choose twice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
he demands that the press should have more access to community documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this does not only serve against electoral fraud , it is also intended to protect the communist government before the bro@@ ader corruption and finance culture that joins it , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets election campaign in the east of London .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , a special optional court ruled that the current mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be dismissed from the corrupt and illegal practices of his office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ished the religious feelings of his Muslim community , &quot; and that he would have brought his critics to the silence of racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man should have led his campaign on the basis of choosing the relief of Muslims to choose Him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to 300 voices were either du@@ bi@@ ous or a result of im@@ itation , when someone else sel@@ ects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric said that there were evidence of fraud in the whole country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he expressed himself especially al@@ ar@@ ming on frau@@ dul@@ ent letters - at the older members of the Muslim community , had made pressure to choose one candidates of their choice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to cleaning the electoral system , including joining out to prove the identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his report it says : &quot; as proof that pressure on the needs of some ethnic minorities has been exerc@@ ised , especially women and young people , in particular to choose from the will of the El@@ der , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or b@@ ang@@ j@@ ch@@ ic background . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there were concerns that ... government institutions would have ignored such behaviour because of &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric spoke about 50 recommendations to clean@@ se the system , including the ban , that political activ@@ ist documents should be submitted to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report , which is drawn by Ther@@ esa May , requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral directory for immigration and social aggreg@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
consider options to en@@ quire voters in front of your choice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not remove remote ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has given her voice to prevent , someone sel@@ ects two times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
systematic review of the nationality of a person perform in order to ensure that they are in@@ discri@@ min@@ ated .
a three @-@ year limit switch to an automatic post@@ code .
prohibition that political activists complete the letter and envelop@@ es of letters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police give the power , shut off the shut down stations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a legal change is facilit@@ ated by the prosecution of the participation of the People Act 1983 ( National Assembly Law 1983 ) .
photographer banned in poll@@ ing stations .
requirement that only English must be used in the voting stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intensi@@ fication of the training , to ensure that the employees usually use that voters go alone in the voting cabin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric fails on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing , &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets didn &apos;t show a criminal complaint . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral Court has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a party on corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; said he . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to a number of reasons , it was found guilty due to the high demands on the criminal proceedings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also critic@@ ises the endless &quot; Ab@@ ha@@ k@@ controls &quot; of the Town Hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Jud@@ gement of Tower Ham@@ lets had a warning signal from the last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country we@@ ars a proud legacy as the mother of par@@ li@@ aments , but the wor@@ r@@ ying and covered spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial was threatening this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Double @-@ winner and other famous double @-@ ends of Olympic athletes in Rio
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this week , fans of the Olympics 2016 in Rio are embar@@ king on the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , who has proved to be an impressive double @-@ end singer of the Du@@ chess in Cambridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the 24 year old Olymp@@ ion@@ ik@@ in is by far not the only one to be Gold @-@ fierce ath@@ lete , at least not if one may not grant their own famous Doppel@@ gänger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are running on our screens in time , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a list of Olympic clinics that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Dutch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the h@@ unter and the wolf : team member of the US team in ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared to Leonardo Di Capri@@ o since childhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from K@@ ates Double , a lot of people appeared on the Internet , like a certain ar@@ cher in the Di@@ dy@@ mus of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di Capri@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the team member of the US team in ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused an attack on Twitter , after images , on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the archers hit the ma@@ dness in the social media , and gave him to hear that he looks like Leo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I see no great simil@@ arity with the exception of the facial hair , &quot; Bra@@ dy of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; he is a goo@@ dly guy , so I summar@@ ize it as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly take place in the center , Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Russian gym@@ n@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina with her great , expressive eyes should go through as a double @-@ candidate for the Cuban American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in swimming pool , South African Schwi@@ mmer Cameron Van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the Gle@@ e Star Matthew Morrison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a course higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athletic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption Drama , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another lasting comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has a similar eye to eyebrows and lips . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian silver medal winner in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points more than just the sun sin@@ gled skin and bl@@ ond hair as the actress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne McC@@ ord has been att@@ ested to the &quot; athletic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial form and eyes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others have also noticed the simil@@ arities
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; theory is put into space : according to this user , there is perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user expressed their satisfaction , that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the U.S. football star Hope Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter an incredibly similar visual form and eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other popular Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile that is almost identical to the actress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas as well as the gold medal winner in Tur@@ ning Gab@@ by Douglas , resembles that of a Bring It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
C@@ BC comm@@ ent@@ ator for the Olympic Games exc@@ uses for his asser@@ tion that Chinese Schwi@@ mmer@@ in died like a pig . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Canadian station C@@ BC would ap@@ ologi@@ ze , after one of his comm@@ ent@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese Schwi@@ mmer@@ ing fell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and during the race as &quot; a pig died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the commentary Byron Mac@@ Don@@ alds thought that his microphone was off , when he was at the end of the 4x@@ 200 Fre@@ isti@@ l@@ pools , his own opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mac@@ Donald , who had been taken on board for the C@@ BS in order to give more &quot; Colour &quot; could be heard : &quot; this little 14 year old Chinese has lost the connection , baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too excited , went down like M@@ ief , died like a pig . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you for that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chinese Schwi@@ mmer@@ ing Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming pool 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which allowed the can@@ adi@@ ers to close up the gap to China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
viewers in all Canada responded quickly online since they were shocked by the sound and language .
Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete : &quot; has the C@@ BC comm@@ ent@@ ator just said that the 14 year old swi@@ mmer is in China &quot; like a pig died ? ? ? ?
the idi@@ ot has not captured that they were still on show . &quot;
Ai Yan@@ han from China was described in the final 4 x 200m Fre@@ isti@@ l@@ pools for women as follows : &quot; this small 14 year old Chinese has lost the connection to the baby . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the criticism of Byron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came fast and hard , in which he made many of his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter users did not get back when they heard , like un@@ sensitive Byron Mac@@ Donald . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another Twitter User@@ in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &apos; Wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you present the C@@ BC and Canada , and lets us look like Ras@@ si@@ est . # ange@@ ek@@ elt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; short time later Scott Rus@@ sel , who published the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald , saying , &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment was broadcast on a floating power . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a un@@ happy elected formulation , we are sorry that it is happening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the commentary mate Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC copied and added his exc@@ use at more than 90 other Twitter users , who compla@@ ined about the comments of Mac@@ Donald . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the network exc@@ uses fast and gave notice a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret it correctly , that these statements were made and that it was possible to broadcast them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday we quickly made us exc@@ used to our audience yesterday , and our Fol@@ lowing in the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to make one clear , By@@ rons comments related to the power of the swi@@ mmer , and not for them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ adequate and un@@ fortunate phr@@ ase . Byron does that which he said , very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald was ap@@ ologi@@ zed , trying to jus@@ tify his re@@ mark by expla@@ ining that it was not intended for a personal attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take time for a moment to exc@@ use me for the comment , I ap@@ ologi@@ ze to the C@@ BC Olympic masters , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I took care of the power of the swi@@ mmer , and not based on them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course no failures was deliber@@ ate and I &apos;m very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mar@@ row has been angry about woman in the middle of the shop sham@@ el@@ essly under@@ wear
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the buyer did not know where to see , when a woman suff@@ ers their clothes in the midst of a Pri@@ mar@@ row to try sub@@ h@@ osen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , she numbered them as she saw in it , pulled out and put her back into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she continued and tried four pairs of sub@@ h@@ osen in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping centre in Folk@@ estone .
Pri@@ mark shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ stone in which the woman took the signatures before they put them back into the shelf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ d@@ son , who had tried at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear , &quot; she returned , and left her business without buying something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she said : &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of the sales area , it took a pair of sub@@ h@@ osen from the location , pulled her own gar@@ ghts and tro@@ users and tried them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t even tried to find a somewhat discreet place to do it - it was simply there , che@@ ek@@ y as O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when they returned the sub@@ h@@ osen that you obviously didn &apos;t like it , because they put her back into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they repeated the same with three other sub@@ sets , before they finally decided that you didn &apos;t want to go out again , and went out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not seem to distur@@ b that someone could observe , or think about the person that would buy under circumstances that had tried them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 who lives in K@@ ent said , &quot; How does anyone wanted to take shelter with home that had a different person , who had not been washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; as I received , the employees have tried to draw the garments from the sale after she went - what is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate it with a new pair of sub@@ h@@ osen to go home and find that another wife she had an@@ gled and had not been washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker of Pri@@ mar@@ row said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is the incident , that occurred on Tuesday , 9th August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from arms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make him something safer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we talked with Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand@@ master of the Kra@@ i Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to walk with armed rob@@ bers near the distance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regardless of whether you are coming from the front or from behind , this video will show you how you turn around for your rob@@ bers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have approached it from the back@@ side , then you should be able to see your att@@ acker and take a look out of the closing line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sei@@ ze the weapon between your front arm and shoulder , before you beat him with your free el@@ bow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beat him up with the knees in the body and rot@@ ate , while the att@@ ack@@ ers turn up against pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him backwards while they move the weapon against him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at att@@ ack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the line , grab the weapon and rot@@ ate them , so the att@@ acker cannot shoot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , take the weight on the weapon and beat the attack on the chest , then you turn out the weapon out of his grip before they move forward and set the weapon against him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see how it makes Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but remember that it is the saf@@ est on the saf@@ est , to transfer your money - if you are not a Kra@@ a Grand@@ master . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
travel@@ er Ian W@@ right sh@@ ab@@ t for a guide to the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ nour@@ ished his immune system and Wür@@ ger@@ ef@@ lex a serious test - taking some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and ec@@ ar@@ est places in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the moder@@ ator and travel@@ er Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k crossed his course on a Euro @-@ shot , a hand@@ ing of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to proof the resistance to its immune system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the le@@ ver@@ ing of each object , he used a le@@ aching to show oneself and to show us what he will let . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the experiment which was filmed under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Streng@@ th &quot; brought some surprising results of daylight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thought to drain the r@@ ins@@ button , which has been used by thousands of others , may be fully rep@@ ell@@ ent , but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on his trip through Europe , Mr. W@@ right talked with doctors and medical professionals across the promotion of gut bacteria and their own health . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
luck@@ ily nothing left for what he stopped to do more than a bad taste in the mouth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. W@@ right was also known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ine by trying to travel through the world , and ate strange as well as wonderful things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; public funds to train stations to r@@ ins@@ ing toilets , the task set his immune system definitely under a sample &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he told : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ worried about what my health concerns , and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms , and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film he was able to meet his call .
the only thing he declined was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his pro@@ be@@ ad showed a lumin@@ ous number of more than 4000 units .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in comparison , the number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was a Russian toilet that refused to ref@@ ill after their L@@ umin@@ omet@@ allic numbers over 4000 units , whereas fresh washed hands was less than 60 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish producer of dairy products vali@@ o produced the Reis@@ ef@@ il@@ m &apos; s Guide to In@@ ner &apos; th &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different locations like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; that comes to the worst , what I ger@@ ated in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing dirt more than that !
I won &apos;t stop here because it is indoor here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner &apos; th &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish producer of dairy products vali@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company pays Mr W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , that contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer consumers something new .
something that is fascinating to look and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we carried out crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ings that ended up that we said &quot; L@@ ass us asked us Ian . &quot;
it asser@@ ts that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , which is associated with the immune system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; growing interest in intestinal Health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide more information on an interesting way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film direc@@ ting the film , said : &quot; let me have lost my respect for Ian , if he had instruc@@ ted some of the things I have instruc@@ ted him , like the Russian toilet that is shown in the movie . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to stop her and others , with which this was quite difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty le@@ aks on film . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in one of the survey carried out by the year 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents in lac@@ tic acid bacteria were associated with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent , that they may contain at least occasionally products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ social family destroyed Del@@ og@@ ation social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash ( Corn@@ wall
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a as@@ o@@ zi@@ al family left its social apartment after a delay of £ 50,000 , because her neighbours spread terror . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were for@@ ci@@ bly removed from their property , people shocked the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the walls , cla@@ d holes , were torn out , tr@@ ash was scattered on the floor , gra@@ ffiti on the floor and gra@@ ffiti on the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the family had moved , and it is assumed that they now live in a private accommodation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall Hou@@ sing , said that she was unable to repair the apartment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I am the opinion that people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are many things to consider , since this property is probably considered as not as beautiful part of Corn@@ walls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is likewise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the meantime , and the police said that the terror that had added the family to fight road struggles , drug abuse , drug traffic@@ king , drug abuse and medi@@ ums . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , got an arrangement for anti@@ social behavior in June . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some rooms of the house , which is torn down under circumstances , ancient tr@@ ash was found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the property , where drugs were traded in the past , the timber boards were torn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neighbors said that they were fighting them on the street , and we had to call the police regularly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Corn@@ wall Hou@@ sing del@@ og@@ ed her and her partner violent from the property , after they gave them an extended period of 11 weeks to give up voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Del@@ og@@ ics were che@@ ered by lighten@@ ed neighbors who said that her life was made to hell .
one said : &quot; they did not meet anyone . &quot;
we lived for 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the countless times , which we say the police here are incredible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; today we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we didn &apos;t know that !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , where they are finally away , it will be nice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adam Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager by Corn@@ wall Hou@@ sing , said that it had to cooperate with the local authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the family lived in the house , to which the police was rec@@ alled in regular intervals , 20 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the over@@ grown side of the Municipal House , garbage and old toys were thrown down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; it is a shame to adopt the ten@@ ant , to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family , because a del@@ og@@ ation is always taking into account the Corn@@ wall Hou@@ sing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a very difficult case , as the behavior was extremely difficult and its actions had to be horrible to see their neighbours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police used by De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the church , who have cour@@ a@@ geous to us and have given us the information you have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours , and the message conve@@ ys that anti@@ social behavior is not toler@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but they were all over 20 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a dirty mattress that resi@@ des in one of the bedrooms of the house after the del@@ og@@ ation on the ground .
workers of the house administration are now to rush to garbage mountains that surround the house
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis and scales , parks and cash at a height of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Skel@@ don got a penalty after being found guilty of ownership of a class B in commercial view .
they claimed that the money for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don was born in 2013 in a car accident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were without ob@@ uns@@ hi@@ des , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many walls of the house were gra@@ ffiti @-@ coated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police says that it is going to hold ten@@ ants , who don &apos;t hold to the house rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela C@@ row told by the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , that del@@ og@@ ation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants that do not hold to the house rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who have deterior@@ ated without self @-@ accus@@ ations as well as those who were damaged by such behaviour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior , which continue to work with partners to protect our communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists in Portugal are transferred to panic after a ti@@ eff@@ ected military jet to the beach
sunshine in Av@@ eiro and Portugal experienced the shock of their life
a portu@@ guese wall P @-@ 3@@ C Orion aircraft put an incredible assault flight
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Air Force showed that it was on a training flight , but insist@@ ed on that no security risk was pre@@ yed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the moment , in which dist@@ orted tourists do start to panic after a ti@@ eff@@ able jet over a full beach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dramatic video recordings showed , as the military aircraft were almost in reach of the sun@@ bathing on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ers jump@@ ed on , as she in@@ comprehen@@ sively began to see about the noise of the sweet@@ eners , without having to see what caused by the clouds to her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Daniel Fern@@ an@@ der , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ists who posted videos on the dramatic Fly @-@ By in social media , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it flew twice very deeply and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; I was just on surfing and it felt like that the plane would fall down upon me . &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were transferred to panic when the plane came from the darkness and flew incredibly low
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , the Portuguese Air Force presented itself to identify the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Orion aircraft on a training flight , to identify fishing boats in front of the coast , so that it was the only possibility to recognize it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man said that the jet was flying slightly deeper due to the bad visibility , however , the Air Force tra@@ cked on it to no time at risk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land fires have destroyed those summer parts of the Portuguese Festival , with which four people came to death in the island of Madeira . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , the Portuguese Air Force showed that the pilot had to fly due to the conditions of the conditions - strong fog and bran@@ dr@@ yers which restri@@ cts his perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the airplane was on a training flight , where the pilot fishing boats had to identify as part of the exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worry about Sevilla
Sevilla - FC Barcelona is fighting the first step in the first title win in the new football season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Catal@@ ans compete in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup , which rises three days later at Camp No@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dou@@ ble@@ eder must ren@@ ounce the Olympic football tournament in the crow@@ ning Cup@@ fin@@ alists and the ruling Europe League champion among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who dispute the Olympic football tournament with Brazil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andre is missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the training , the Germans suffered a b@@ aff@@ le in the knee , with what the one question is clari@@ fied at least in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for two years , Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er Ste@@ gen came to Barcelona &apos;s status as number one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coach Luis En@@ rique ren@@ ounced having a clear decision so far and made Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er Ste@@ gen enters the most other applicants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the first official game of the season there is a doubt about the fitness state of the team which was hum@@ bled on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 .
also at 3 : 2 in the Pro@@ ver@@ al@@ opp Against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday knew Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co . not really convincing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sevilla in turn has to di@@ gest the 2 : 3 defeat in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid , continuing the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona has been with eleven successes of the record winner in this application .
Ma Long in a own league of table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old settled in Rio de Janeiro in a one @-@ sided finale to his comp@@ atri@@ ot and title defence &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12.@@ 4.4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this won the first &quot; Golden Grand Slam &quot; with success at WM , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ al@@ tournament and just Olympia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese J@@ un Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two Chinese succeeded in the end game , and made the title one another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was clear that for the third time a Chinese call would pick the single @-@ title title in the sign of five rings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympic Tre@@ pp@@ chen was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Leg@@ ion@@ ary ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were left to the record alone , between the sentences and in time @-@ outs they had no en@@ coding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had withdrawn on the Tribun@@ e and had their prot@@ ections on a fair competition alone .
&quot; I &apos;ve played the Mat@@ ches up here for my country . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the finals I was speaking for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game of a gold and silver medal winner with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly un@@ expect@@ edly .
Ma was really struggling with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent in the first set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that he set the pace at the top , and left Z@@ hang from there only a total of 13 points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the su@@ peri@@ ority of Ma developed not the expected t@@ earing off match .
nevertheless however enough breathtaking ball changes were to be seen .
Miz@@ ut@@ ani won the game for bronze against the 40 year old Vladimir Sam@@ son 4 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the white E@@ tr@@ us@@ se had moved in his quarter @-@ final against the German European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , after a medical treatment , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to beg@@ ged with tin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve WAL@@ DN@@ ER ( 38 / 2004 ) and J@@ ör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) were also similar to the high table tennis @-@ old Olympia @-@ Fourth .
Donald Tr@@ ump is dre@@ aming of huge problems ″ in the election campaign
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership of the US Repub@@ lic@@ ans will be pla@@ gued by massive sorrow , even in traditional conservative states and their majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Presi@@ dential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now gave weak@@ nesses of his campaign campaign in the previous republi@@ can strongh@@ old Utah .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a rare moment , where the usually large @-@ lane and self @-@ confident multic@@ ent@@ on@@ aire said something about any concerns how correspon@@ dents reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the Republi@@ can camp from the race , the doubts grow up in the battle for the White House . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have enormous problems in Utah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump from Protestant Christians that he asked for support in major states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the wrong reports are guilty of his can@@ did@@ acy , he res@@ umed his well @-@ known media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
republi@@ can Hoch@@ bur@@ sts w@@ ack@@ ers
Utah is usually a secure bank for the Republi@@ can .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a survey by Sur@@ v@@ ey@@ US from June , Tr@@ ump and his cont@@ en@@ ary was on account of the Democrats , Hillary Clinton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other institutes look tr@@ ump forward , but not by far the distance that Republi@@ can candidates are common in the State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Arizona and Georgia are also considered as endangered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview of the Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump rep@@ lied to the question of how he wants to stop the rise of the Clinton &apos;s advance , &quot; just as I did it so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if left : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he does not make anything else to tell you &quot; the truth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not rich for him at the end of the political correc@@ t@@ ness , the order is fine , said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to press reports , the Party of Tr@@ ump is to have threatened to supp@@ ress funds to support his election campaign , he should not present any better conversion values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of its wool , the candidates of the Republi@@ can attack stronger than arms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Olympic : three De@@ dic@@ als at D@@ oping @-@ Test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary commission .
Ken@@ yan &apos;s meet for the second d@@ oping affair at the Rio de Janeiro &apos;s Olympic Games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after an attempt at a d@@ oping in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a trainer at home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the International Olympic Committee , the International Olympic Committee will immediately address a disciplinary commission to investigate the case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Spr@@ inter and present coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , announced that the former Spr@@ inter and present coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , issued a urine test under the name of the 800 metre runners F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was reported by the Team@@ Committee of Kenya from D@@ oping Controll@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the IA@@ AF has searched the IO@@ C for information about the case , in order to monitor their own studies , a IA@@ AF spokes@@ man shared with . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the study and the following measures of IO@@ C the IA@@ AF will evaluate an assessment , &quot; it was called in a IA@@ AF statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to D@@ oping control station and joined the D@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , the sample issued and signed , &quot; Ken@@ yan boss de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i stated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was owned by the ac@@ cre@@ dit@@ ation of athletes who stood on the list for the training controls of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich had become over 800 meters in Beijing in Beijing .
four days before that the Ken@@ yan Ath@@ le@@ tics Meeting was pulled off by the Rio Olympics from Rio Olympics .
he should have informed about money payments of his country over upcoming d@@ oping tests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to media reports , he report@@ edly was arrested at the airport of Nairobi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kenya has been under special observation at the IO@@ C after a long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the announcement of the IO@@ C submitted more than 2,000 d@@ oping targets before the Rio Olympics , previously pointed out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were taken into visual acu@@ ity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the summer games in Brazil , the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency explo@@ ded a lot of pressure on African land , an anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a functioning control system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the WA@@ DA Kenya received from the list of countries that are def@@ ending d@@ oping with the rules of WA@@ DA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kenya is considered as a big runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 Championship in Beijing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a series of television reports , the ARD was repeatedly aver@@ aged that in Kenya d@@ oping resources are easily accessible and there is to be a significant ment@@ ality of sporting goods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und finally called for a similar examination in Kenya as he had hired them in the Russian athle@@ tics .
it could be proven that in this sport @-@ wide @-@ surface and systematically d@@ opt has been introduced .
Russia &apos;s athletes have been excluded from the summer games .
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cecilia Bart@@ oli
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ Year , the Salzburger Fest@@ spiele present the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Mary as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with a surprising Cecilia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story &quot; , Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ stein &apos;s master@@ piece .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the artistic director Cecilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical in the classic temple of classical music , and met with the role of Mary a youth mare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the orchestra pit , Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the leadership of the Venezu@@ elan conductor Gust@@ av@@ o D@@ ud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; war@@ ms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we always say that they are very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix that is the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really enjoyed our music in our blood !
in this production Bart@@ oli plays a little older Maria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she reminds of her love with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
firstly because they are musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says in her song : &quot; I Fe@@ el Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I Fe@@ el Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it is wise , of course na@@ i@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it resembles me very much my Italian character that I have as a Roman in &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli .
D@@ ud@@ amel is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such a honour for us to work with her .
it is a tremend@@ ously generous person .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is such an exceptional artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one sees it in every of its movements , in his eyes , it is his life ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a happy approach to life , that is very important at all ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; at the moment : &quot; in this piece , it is about pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we took the refugees , then the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ans went to New York , and the New York inhabitants didn &apos;t want them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the same themes , and they are just as meaningful today as they are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
59 years later this piece is still relevant .
London cham@@ ber@@ maid who joined the IS in London was killed in Syria
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ka@@ di@@ za SU@@ LT@@ ANA , one of three British school girls who left London to join the IS , report@@ edly died in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was alleged that they were killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the valley of the group , the IT@@ V News on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SU@@ LT@@ ANA was 17 years old and died after her family , shortly after she had pre@@ occupied the war and to return to England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can only hope that the only good is in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are associated to a war zone - people of whom to make this decision , &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in February 2015 , SU@@ LT@@ ANA and two other school ma@@ ids rose from east London to Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sult@@ anas family has been told that she has married a ISIS &apos; fighter in Syria , and it became a widow within a few months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d says , Clinton will remain in the case of a election win at Gar@@ land as candidates for the Supreme Court &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the Presi@@ dential candidate of the Democrats , Hillary Clinton is appointed Judge of Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March , the Republi@@ can have blocked confirmation since its nom@@ ination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority leader in the Senate Mitch Mc@@ Con@@ nell , is the opinion that the next president will appoint the successor to the Prince Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said Thursday during a telephone conference , that he expects to choose from Clinton to &quot; choose &quot; with certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker of Rei@@ d said later that he would not speak to Clinton , whether they would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he praised the she@@ ath , and said , Clin@@ tons team would not care for un@@ rest with a new candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gar@@ land is the first judge for the US App@@ eal Court for the District of Columbia .
RAID said that Republi@@ can blocked the nomin@@ ee nom@@ ination to be lic@@ a@@ ies and hel@@ pers of the republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also provided , Donald Tr@@ ump was un@@ suitable for the presidential office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tre@@ ats wants to find nude calendar for &quot; women and for men &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tre@@ ats magazine collabor@@ ates with photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere in order to bring a 1970s Pi@@ re@@ lli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but instead of famous nude people , they would like to find the next generation of Top@@ models for 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of this year , Chief Editor of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us that his nak@@ edness magazine of Old@@ school Play@@ boy has been distingu@@ ish@@ able since &quot; Play@@ boy for men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am doing it for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apparently , he &apos;s the view that the Calendar does also . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to return again to depic@@ t tim@@ eless and classic nak@@ edness in which both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release for publication of the Cal@@ endars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful artwork .
models can submit their pictures online or personally at open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish people anticip@@ ates mass cur@@ ses
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who do not fit and Erdogan is seated on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the closing of the Gü@@ len @-@ close Foundation dialogue and world , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in short , the Kurdish community of Germany anticip@@ ates tens of thousands of protection seeking out from Turkey to Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , it could even be &quot; several hundred thousand , &quot; believes the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the hard work of the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan , following the attempt of put@@ sch , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass cur@@ ses to Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands of thousands of refugees from Turkey in Germany when the Erdogan regime is fighting the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; from Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government passed away Kurdish flood months ago , 500,000 Kurds have been on the run . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the me@@ ticul@@ ous coup there are still secular and op@@ position@@ ist ethnic Turks .
many will want to re@@ boot in Europe if they are supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that even refugees exp@@ orting refugees in their own country , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chief of Defence accused the focused sett@@ ling of Syrian Arab in Kurdish , but also in Algeri@@ an towns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that Erdogan therefore wants to increase the pressure to the remaining Kurds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradi@@ cated in the last hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CDU member . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the group leader called that the federal government has positioned itself as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a &quot; witch ch@@ ase &quot; is also taking place in Germany too against Erdogan critics .
in recent months I feel no longer safe in Germany for the first time .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also feared the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany and mainly Kurds and opposition .
the fire mark@@ up as Gü@@ len tra@@ ilers are destroyed by teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who do not fit and Erdogan is seated on packed suit@@ cases , by the way Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , said the Gü@@ len @-@ close Foundation dialogue and education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the newspaper reports on appeal to figures of the Federal Ministry of Interior , the Turks previously established the largest group of asylum seek@@ ers recognized in Germany by the coup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as of June 30 , this 11.@@ 386 people and thus almost 29 percent of all as as@@ yl@@ enti@@ ally recognized recognised ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this survey , they are not compla@@ ined before war , poverty , or business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asylum seek@@ ers according to the Basic Law are only politically , thus followed by a rule of law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; where to go where it does &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals also get nothing from the summer campaign with - and the vac@@ ation@@ d from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2021 , the Parliament election will not take place directly at the end of summer holidays , the heav@@ iness parliament decided already at the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because foolish so far it is not : summer holidays , heat and high @-@ day fight - this is bit@@ ing .
the locals that are to be convinced by the fighters are on holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the most vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on Use@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not indigenous , so do not choose the country day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are practical issues : in the holidays , hel@@ pers are attach@@ able to spread the posters , spread the flyer and put on the end of the votes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until 4th September 2016 , the electoral and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern must leave for once more campaign close by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot phase , if you can &apos;t have it at all , has just begun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition , must fear His ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the SPD , since 1998 the strongest party , is now clearly in the p@@ olls behind the CDU .
exciting is how strong new@@ com@@ er Af@@ D cut off and what remains in the end of the co@@ ali@@ er &apos;s ability to remain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years of age and since 2008 , Head of Staff , makes an almost in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from his big pla@@ posters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he travels through the country , spread to ro@@ ses and chat a little with the people , as it already did his legendary leader Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise sailors get cold feet and give Chancellor Merkel the blame on the b@@ lossom of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , their &quot; We create the &quot; climb up the rise of the pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CDU with its peak data , the interior minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is , if one makes the wrong time at the right place of voting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has invited two German Merkel ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel and Merkel &apos;s German Chancellor Angela Merkel lies in the north east .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the target group did not agree that there were more than North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as the Mecklenburg @-@ Westphalia and Vorpommern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; def@@ endant Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it too bad no one from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , the Nor@@ theast CDU wai@@ ves the usual sel@@ ections on market grounds and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbre@@ llas and ballo@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s how Kok@@ ert thinks he is still a &quot; minor role . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also the Union has noticed that you have stran@@ gled the base on the land , that it has to be very severe to find a wire to the people again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are , like the left , the SPD , the Green Party , hardly exists in the land of land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the CDU election victim Kok@@ ert to his co @-@ stre@@ iter is also self @-@ lar@@ v@@ ating : &quot; you must go there where the people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , any birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because a lot on the game stands , Sell@@ ering has called his SPD to a particularly committed electoral campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in p@@ olls , S &amp; D Group reported 22 percent behind partners ( 25 ) and only just before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2011 , the SPD had clearly gained 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CDU ( 22 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Green party , small party with seven percent in the p@@ olls , must accomplish the leap in the parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they make a modern virtu@@ e of holiday , and exp@@ ose their campaign to the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; online campaign &quot; calls it the president of Claudia Müller .
otherwise green elections embar@@ ks on cy@@ an@@ che search for native ab@@ ili@@ ti@@ ers under the tourists .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ ek and the top can@@ did@@ ac@@ tin that is straight away with a house@@ boat by the m@@ ec@@ cl@@ en@@ ic lakes and is also nice to find .
your impression : &quot; voting holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ restoration : restaurants are suffering from locking
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in speed , with which the B 27 is renovated , there is nothing to compla@@ in about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those responsible of the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30 am in the morning and only at 20 o &apos;clock , there are all praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they have done everything quite delicate , &quot; says El@@ vira T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the jet gas station .
this is a super@@ team .
there is no hiding place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the site could be moved to the south at the start of the week , until the end of October everything will be ready . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the design of those responsible for the construction works will also be praised . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the construction site has been turned on Monday to the south and also the locking of the asphalt road in O@@ spre@@ d@@ ingen , and so the connection to Rot@@ tenburg has been restored , and the traffic situation within the place was relaxed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the people now can drive from O@@ fan@@ d@@ ingen to the B 27 on both sides .
the escap@@ ing traffic through the place seems to fall back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were some serious complaints , &quot; says the Deputy Chief Executive Officer Florian King . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inhabitants of Bach &apos;s Basi@@ lica , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had sought to fight with more traffic noise and more were looking for their Nav@@ i as sig@@ nage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happened to some heavy trucks in residential areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the speed limits were not followed , the assembly demanded the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was considerable over@@ sh@@ elling , &quot; says King , who made himself a spot on the location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two to three per minute was sl@@ ated .
the high speed was on the road with 77 hour@@ ly miles .
but since the construction site has been moved on site it has become more cal@@ mer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for business people at the B 27 , it is only a small comfort that customers from red tenburg are now open the road again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
business people do not like to watch over the cards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but that the B 27 @-@ restoration of them has led to them in turnover , each one asks you to look through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however some more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who do with the &quot; end customer &quot; has less to do so for other companies , for which the restoration is hardly any consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sul@@ z is also dre@@ aming of a &quot; most slight decline in Ma@@ ier , but also provides a fact that &quot; the run@@ time is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the spots along the road are exploited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is already exist@@ ent .
not only him but all the restaurants have hit it hard . &quot;
they lack@@ ed the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we must be happy with every euro sales .
the sales income climbed up to &quot; far more than 50 per cent . &quot;
the road marking took his business &quot; past two years . &quot;
he had to have dismissed half of his staff .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , the president Jörg Schmidt on a request from G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial balance that would benefit from the benefits of location at the B 27 . now they have to take advantage of the restoration of the restoration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other lands where something more generous was handled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all cases , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , the family business has already settled here since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the complicated traffic guidance , other regul@@ ars are less frequent , he can understand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you can &apos;t drive , it is also elsewhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the rehabilitation , G@@ öh@@ ner got no doubt about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the crises with BSE and birds , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the effects of the B 27 construction on his client@@ ele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its inn in many years of history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
six months of construction work is already brutal .
constantly in the name of terror attacks on laws .
after the most recent attacks of the Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère we now set a th@@ icker security package .
but what has a legal status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say about all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère disc@@ usses the Com@@ promis@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all his suggestions are politically acceptable to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister for the concept of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they overwhel@@ med no one .
others and other points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I too touch me too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but as the interior minister , he was lying on results and in a &quot; achiev@@ able con@@ sensus &quot; within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère has left a little time after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , before he presented his conclusions for safety in the Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but they fall now all the more extensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a lot is already known , announced , announced , that a new security authority should take care of the un@@ pack of encrypted communications is not new . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is also not the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU requirements to passenger data and arms .
the call for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities is also not surprising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère starts a second run for proposals that have not been involved with the SPD : he wants to put away for terrorist groups in punishment and jihadists with double citizenship in the German passport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; says the CDU man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is still essential to reasonable and need nothing , which doesn &apos;t have any chance with the coalition partner anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few new ideas are presented by Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they partly have it in itself , he plans to embar@@ k on shifts and more possibilities for the imprisonment of people prior to expul@@ sion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugees that are targeted into the country , should leave their smart phones and dis@@ close social media accounts for a safety test . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of troub@@ les for expired asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to be worse than so far - such as such , the crimes committed or deliber@@ ately throw their papers to wear their identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of them is politically and legally holi@@ es .
it also acts un@@ balanced and makes questions open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in some points - for the un@@ equal treatment of imp@@ ati@@ ence , for example - is the question : what does it actually have to do with security and terror ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the topics refugees and terror .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not subject to talk , that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg have been refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many people in view of the high refugee wor@@ ries about security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and things that people deep@@ ened people , don &apos;t let themselves be cl@@ inging even in sel@@ ections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inner security is enormous in the focus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the safegu@@ arding is great .
and yes it is cont@@ oured .
Union and SPD are therefore increasingly focusing on the subject of internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past few days , it passed between the two parties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only a gar@@ dener dispute over the interior of the Federal Police , then on a safety policy collection of some union interior ministers , in which the Ress@@ orts also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a revers@@ al of double citizenship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère rel@@ ates us to con@@ cili@@ atory sounds .
he does not hold anything from a barrier of double pass .
we have noticed the discussion in Germany .
do not make it any sense .
and I have constitutional objec@@ tions to a Bur@@ ka ban .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether its own package is un@@ constitutional , and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partners , it has to be displayed only . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there &apos;s a lot in what to worry about dispute .
but the SPD is currently trying to pro@@ filing an internal security issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first party manager Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alis@@ es a lot of talk times and says , &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that will contribute to safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another Volkswagen gli@@ mp@@ e comes through .
the delivery figures rise to the world despite the diesel engine .
but it does not work in all markets .
in the call@@ back action there is a term .
Volkswagen launches the deliveries of deliveries in the second half of the year .
Europe &apos;s biggest coach can still present a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in July , the core brand of VW mainly transported in Western Europe and strongly charged the total sales , as announced in the Da@@ x . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the brand was sold worldwide by VW in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the hometown of Germany the deliveries of nearly a sixth th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brand leader Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker numbers from July , especially on two sales days less in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also given a purchase back in some of the core markets by &quot; changing economic framework . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the situation around the attempt of put@@ sch in Turkey , the British vote failed to leave the EU , explained a speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the U.S. , where the exhaust gas was first used , a minus is also available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
the mostly affected house brand of the Nieder@@ sachsen is further gli@@ mp@@ ing through the diesel sc@@ andal : only an extra@@ dition minus 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available for the first seven months .
group leader Fred Kap@@ pler was able to present a sale place from January to July .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1.3 percent more vehicles supplied vehicles in this period , 5.@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software exhaust .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany alone , VW is calling for around 2.5 million cars to upgrade into the workshops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the course of re@@ armament , VW , that the conversion of cars doesn &apos;t have any negative effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after upgrading the vehicles , there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after retro@@ fitting a &quot; guarantee &quot; certificate , I don &apos;t speak of a &quot; guarantee , &quot; as it was called on Friday in business trips . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason to be legal fin@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus , Volkswagen opened its German customers now a guarantee of equipped diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this confirmed this last Monday VW representative on the Federal Ministry of Transport .
from the Ministry of Transport it was confirmed that there was a meeting .
&quot; VW has made the requirements of my Committee of In@@ quiry and the KBA complete . &quot;
&quot; variations of this will not be accepted by the Ministry of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the Ministry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has taken the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power after conversion does not take any deteri@@ oration and all the type @-@ relevant vehicle values have remained unchanged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen himself uses the term &quot; guarantee , &quot; but not how it was called in business trips . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the wide term &quot; guarantee , Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers will come back for example half a year after a retro@@ fitting with a motorcycle in a workshop - and if the damage could do nothing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in customer Inter@@ est , it is important to avoid that there is nothing to do with the g@@ ass@@ andal that there is nothing to do with the Ab@@ g@@ ass@@ andal , as it was called . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore VW use the term &quot; guarantee &quot; not .
Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich spar@@ ks in the future of pen@@ alties - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , Bank leader Josef Paul said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers to park the 40 million euros on checking or day monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German Association of German banks speaks of an individual case , and does not need to worry about normal savings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; banks money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , you must pay 0.4 percent pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fee requires Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund , from September by private and corporate clients to deposits over 100,000 euros on checking or day monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 Euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 will cost € 400 in the year , &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he rose 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day to another , and could not be able to compla@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these lie with me on the central bank account and drop 0.4 percent cost , &quot; said the ban@@ ker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t lay down for each million € 4000 . &quot;
the costs now add to the wrong principle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cash simply can be found in the v@@ aults of Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank would be much too dangerous : &quot; I haven &apos;t seen four survi@@ ves , I don &apos;t like to be the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most customers could have understanding and change on other investments .
few emig@@ rated to other banks .
the cooperative association Bayern explained : &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB is causing considerable costs in all banks . &quot;
they are alone to bear ; be &quot; business economically resistant &quot; not possible . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some German banks have therefore increased their fees for bank transfer , credit cards or transfers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with pris@@ als for deposits from three million euros , the Thur@@ ing@@ ian People and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burger country had head@@ lines head@@ lines in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Chief Executive Officer of the Banking Association said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect to pay private clients nationwide relief for deposits , but the competition in Germany is much too strong in banks and savings banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a ban@@ ker said that on the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a client@@ ele that is a bit opul@@ ent from the fortune . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become the problem for a small bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; founded in 1911 , the G@@ mund is a branch office in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ tah em@@ bers , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the President of the Federal Association of the German banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ banks ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich had said : &quot; the threshold , into negative towards the private client , is very , very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the competition is hard , and it imp@@ lies the migration of investors to competition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

destination panels : who do actually buy sound plates ?
lonely men middle ages love plates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you see the commentary volume to over@@ saw him under the p@@ seud@@ onym non @-@ sam@@ pler &apos;s age with rough ins@@ ults , this statement is derived from current data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the complex formation of sound records is not due to a boom in m@@ illenni@@ als who want to greet the news of physical objects , but to Mid@@ life No@@ stal@@ gia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who have recently purchased a record , are between 45 and 54 in advance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the unlikely event group .
there is also no hor@@ des through Hob@@ b@@ ys@@ amm@@ ers - it has an emotional meaning : older record runners retain their feelings for itself ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this blog would be a news report on television , I would run my camera in a mo@@ oring street in Soh@@ o , I keep my hands and something better . &quot; so , let &apos;s throw a closer look to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so let &apos;s throw a look at it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if the heart of So@@ Ho is slow at its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent sellers were based - there are still a hand@@ ful of fantastic record shops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would probably ask the camera to switch the camera for the next part , where I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to cher@@ ish her age and mind by observation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stuart , 55 , the I of Si@@ ster Ray ( count of data : two young women , three men aged aged ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records . one day long for a meeting in London and goes through the shops in order to fill the few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is he a collector I wonder ?
&quot; I &apos;m already looking for &quot; he says .
I have about 3.000 or 4.000 records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these sound plates , pictured above ( he has sent me the snap@@ shot via e @-@ mail , I &apos;m not followed by him ) , dressing the walls of his room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of its available income : it is now able to buy plates that he could not afford , when he was sold and sold again when he was young and ple@@ ite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy , are from the late 60s , early 70s , which was released when I was 11 or 12 , when I was probably something too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that those who are buying records , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is my La@@ ster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , believes that many customers who hits the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it also has noticed a new wave on people who have heard about the com@@ eback and let &apos;s see how to buy their old plates again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the talks that I have led , people usually have escaped their collection in 1998 or 1999 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; customers that once sold their records to buy CDs , sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like ph@@ onica to see that record shops has a calm community of par@@ ables .
according to WE@@ Z some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to retreat to the stability of entrusted m@@ ophone records , of objects , the happy Ju@@ gen@@ der@@ ail@@ ments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think , sometimes it can be the filling of a void or owned material property than a kind of comfort , &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is with me as collectors and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to work spirit@@ ually .
&quot; we are like their social worker ! &quot; rec@@ orders a staff of a plate stack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a survey of IC@@ M in April revealed that nearly 50 % of those who purchased a record last month , have not yet stopped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the survey also found out that 41 % have a turn@@ table that they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a plate , have no turn@@ tables . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this point of the news report I would probably look very worried as I smo@@ other a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova Com@@ pil@@ es .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at sounds of the Universe ( Number of result : three men aged aged ) has noticed a &quot; trop@@ hy &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somebody only came here recently , and said , &quot; I &apos;m not buying a turn@@ table , but I would like to buy a radio ron record , so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a large percentage but it definitely happens .
more product las@@ ers@@ less , less musical .
we have people who say : &quot; I have no turn@@ table . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are younger people , not older , which are only slow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ opp , which has devoted the sound plates nearly a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience than I do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are couples about 70 , tourists , making photos , teenagers and women of middle ages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts is the latest Syn@@ th@@ esi@@ as@@ - and sex@@ ist pop instead of Experim@@ ental Jazz . it is good to see such diversity among customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; none of them looks very lonely , but nutri@@ tious psych@@ ic trau@@ mat@@ a are hard to imagine if you are standing next to someone 30 seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs away in business for a few minutes and considers the variety of panels available for sale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s more powerful than a big mannequ@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it does not deserve much , therefore the collection of plates is not real option , says it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it costs much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; it drives with a de@@ composed si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my last stop is a store , which is said that a new generation of record lovers is to have inspired : urban outfit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while I am writing the coup@@ é , I am watching a group of young teenagers accused of group@@ ing for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before buying a father and daughter to buy a crossover turn@@ table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the left there is a stair@@ well , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody looks at her - maybe because they are purely decorative , some as far as it is impossible to start them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry , and if some customers could send more money to the depths of So@@ Ho for more , there is nothing to compla@@ in about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , also that is the most suitable for luxury objects such as plates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if my research is revealed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v allow her to exist , at least in record shops in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and female lovers that exist in online shops , in@@ consider@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they spend their Thursday morning with safety not by plates by plates of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while keeping the shoulders of an un@@ fur@@ ious , 30 years old false present@@ er that rises over the shoulders of one middle age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

French Court re@@ jects offer on demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a French Court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live , settle down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when hearing these week , the authorities ar@@ gued that the State should be authorized to sell 72 temporary shops , selling hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were ar@@ gued that these places should be demolished , because they would not be paid to a parallel economy that would not be paid for a fire and risk of fire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals are offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups that would offer enough food for growing numbers in stock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , they carried out that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the instruction of people who run the 72 provisional shops , but realized that the pre@@ f@@ ecture of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were absolutely comprehen@@ sible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the places that was threatened by the Nieder@@ re@@ mor@@ sel , was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is fully operated and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as a counsel@@ ing for the hundreds of protection needs , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in stock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

despite Olympics dis@@ appointment : Martin remains struggling
despite his dis@@ appo@@ inting performance in the Olympic period he didn &apos;t want to get Tony Martin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I keep moving forward the World Cup at the glance , that the 31 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not have a declaration for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place at Zu@@ ck@@ erh@@ ut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to me it &apos;s hon@@ estly , hard to comment by yesterday , &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he needed to analyze the reasons for de@@ bac@@ le .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the time of the World Cup in Qatar in Qatar , Martin wanted to fight his title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I will see everything exactly what we have changed in the last time . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany &apos;s breed must be set to the next generation of speed@@ ometer : in different federal states , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are being tested , the Temp@@ os@@ ers are particularly effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the futur@@ istic @-@ effective enforcement of the Vit@@ ronic company from Wiesbaden , for example , can be used for example on accident he@@ aps where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , to highway construction sites or to smooth bridges with temporary pace , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure the adher@@ ence to the speed limit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a durable mobile setup can be dangerous or costly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days , the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with laser measuring technology , all vehicles can also be recorded simultaneously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
variable Speed limit and passage forbidden to time , vehicle strip and vehicle class can also be monitored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in high @-@ driven condition , one can move the pendant by manufacturer with trailer hit@@ ch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so that it is not easy to read , it is lowered into the measuring mode , so that the wheels in the arm@@ or and by the way also disappear outside bus@@ h@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter in front of v@@ and@@ alism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even foreign authorities flas@@ hed with the new technology : recently , France has made 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain brings silver to the 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by , after Fiji Master@@ class Gold . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the impressive performance of Great Britain at 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by came to a ab@@ rupt stop at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were beaten in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in de@@ odor@@ o stage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fiji shared a master class in the handling , Side @-@ Step@@ ping , swe@@ eping , line @-@ down and raw power to win Gold - their first Olympic medal in any colour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defeat was caused by the not too bad luck prize by the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they fought New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall in the finals .
but some of them did not have a 15 @-@ man team defeated in this form .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could be a comfort for GB - but it probably won &apos;t be a gold medal around his neck tomorrow : Fi@@ j@@ is chief trainer Ben Ryan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
GB had a difficult way behind them .
eight years ago she was lost under Ryan any game about Adel@@ aide Sev@@ ens .
they just lost one .
this sle@@ dge is hurt - but progress is amazing .
Fiji began wonderful and ordered the Att@@ acks of GB@@ S from fun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co . at , when one would run in travelling buses . the World Series winner went from 5 @-@ 0 upwards when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au moved to the corner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with four minutes of playing time , Jerry Tu@@ wai added another attack on the right corner that he turned around . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are 12 to 0 and GB hard to touch the ball .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a prev@@ ailing table of Mitchell stop the mountain from Sierra Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third goal , but Fiji has only stopped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the seventh minute , J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua makes a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the res@@ p and there was still over a minute game time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u did a further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB teams and stor@@ my until the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is like Fiji , which was born to play 7 , while UK still studied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is like that too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; GB resulted in basic changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through a brilliant inter@@ play of Fiji . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dan Norton launched an attempt in the left corner , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went very long in favor of the Sou@@ se@@ ein@@ sul@@ ans whose fans sang and danced on the grand@@ stand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful base of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame set the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds .
the chan@@ gel@@ es chan@@ ted the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and destroyed in the lawn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier on the day , Fiji Japan defeated 20 @-@ 5 in a semi @-@ final match in a tight semi @-@ final match in Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan Norton interrupted the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a goal among the posts in the second half . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a brilliant later called Tac@@ kling of Marcus Watson , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ Main Team , secured the win - and therefore the silver medal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather st@@ anning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the trainer .
there will be no lower than any gold than these games and that &apos;s what you want .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the first stro@@ kes up to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve in history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather st@@ anning found an extra meaning in their golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even though it was only those who were sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was one of the first women in the history of British sports , that put on such a scale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her dom@@ ination was absolutely , at least her 3@@ 9.@@ 9 was im@@ bedded , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we see are two brilliant ath@@ lete , which gli@@ des over the surface with the elegance of weak@@ nesses , which does not reflect the nature of the triumph@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behind any gold in the rowing , a batt@@ ali@@ on of will@@ ingness to contribute to the in@@ cle@@ ment@@ als that make up the difference and it was no one more hel@@ pless than the trainer , who was diagnosed this day at all , when cancer was diagnosed with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as he said he ris@@ ky something .
I had bladder cancer that is oper@@ able and they did .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not do this , he is spreading everywhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been a rather simple situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trio had luck that he could be with the beginning of 2014 , out of season , what the break was to begin , if that in such circumstances is the right concept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I needed money and so I needed to go better again .
it was an incentive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was in the hospital and ran at the station around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it begins so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rowing on itself is already a challenge , but this makes it one more bigger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the in@@ consistency of victory , their first thoughts on Williams , which had a ner@@ ven@@ ous morning , spent a little more than anything else and tried to process his own fears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ anning , which was as cent@@ ur@@ ion in the Royal Arti@@ llery regim@@ ent in a deployment in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week an emotional wreck . that &apos;s maybe something extremely , but it means much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it just repe@@ ats how much me this means how much I and Helen and Helen and also have worked Robin .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one ; therefore a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I could not have a better person for exercising or a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather st@@ anning have lost no race in the last five years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the couple had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents were unable to keep up with . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were caught very at the moment .
Helen called &quot; staying in the process that remains in the process . &quot;
it &apos;s really important to un@@ tear yourself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had a good start and at the same time , we were not out to make some Tol@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we wanted no fireworks , we wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race what we did . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pair will take time for one year , before making decisions about its future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Glo@@ ver must appear next week at a wedding in her own with the TV adventures Steve Back@@ shall .
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I did not want to say that my last race was .
that would have much pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in London , it took about six months to understand that I am a Olympic Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better &quot; she said .
for 31 years is exemplary for clarity
the Managing Director of the &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ock group &quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , is reti@@ ring .
the association is considered &quot; Bavarian @-@ wide . &quot;
a small Frank@@ ish drinking water association as a model for the large water producers .
so it was called the original fun@@ nel in a post by the Bavarian Radio .
little later the Water Forum of the Government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ es preached the constra@@ int .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ ing group sailed to Bavarian @-@ wide as exemplary . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behind all this Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the twen@@ ties , was 28 years of managing director . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he was reti@@ ring at the age of 65 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the drinking water association with headquarters in Kot@@ t@@ endorf , municipality Breit@@ brun@@ n , provides approximately 150 000 cubic meters of water every year and provides 32 places and ham@@ let with about 5@@ 500 residents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; member communities are the congregations of Kirch@@ ner , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are water supply contracts for further cities and communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current President , Breit@@ brun@@ n &apos;s Conference in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , remembered that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed as a Wasser@@ wart in 1985 and was appointed CEO of the twen@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his tasks are very diverse and they extended from water management building and maintenance operations on office and organisation operations , calculation of fees and contributions up to emergency rates on weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as outstanding events it called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) and the renovation of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of the new fountain ( 1999 ) and the renovation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the restructuring of water pipes ( 2004 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not given any down@@ time and we &apos;ve always recorded innovations , because water lives and drinking water the most important food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her Lau@@ da@@ tio she pra@@ ising G@@ ö@@ ll@@ ers loyal , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has worked with a lot of heart blood for its water @-@ purpose association , and he managed to live the water @-@ purpose association , as if it were his own company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few weeks ago , he was able to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ ing group to present nit@@ rate pollution in front of the water forum of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this he received much appreciation and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller s@@ lei@@ c &apos;s fi@@ anc@@ ée Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked together for 28 years with him .
he is the best veter@@ an and he was a faithful bul@@ let .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as highlights from his perspective he described the fountain of Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the restructuring of the square .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were in church lou@@ der at church lou@@ der , 3 January . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at minus 17 degrees , we had to work throughout the whole night so that the loc@@ alities could be supplied with water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the supply of Neu@@ brun@@ n can be maintained once only , because you have filled the reservoir of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer by Lau@@ ter who will succeed Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

the sacrifice was born in 1988 and the perpet@@ r@@ ator in 1981 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the competent police in Lü@@ beck initially wanted no indication of the relationship between perpet@@ rators and sacrifice , but it confirmed that a man had been killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is a killing deli@@ um . &quot;
&quot; more we don &apos;t say &quot; more &quot; we said a police search in Lü@@ beck .
ey@@ e@@ witnesses have thus been a special service command ( SEK ) at the crime scene .
steel - Licht@@ blick for Deutsche steel industry
the torn and energy @-@ based German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in millions of millions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial loads , threatened by the industry from the oil @-@ cost extraction , are from the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it remains with the liberation of the renewable energy sources in the manufacturing plants for the so @-@ called ei@@ ving production in the German steel industry , said Federal Economic Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West German General Newspaper . &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday issue ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m really happy that we could finally reach after two years of tough negotiations . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the European Commission , the European Commission initially planned to use steel producers to produce gases in electricity production for your own consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry made an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year according to the German industry sector .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z : there is now a principle of discovery with the EU Commission for talks with competition Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators in the steel works have been replaced , f@@ alle an EEG real@@ location of 20 percent .
but also these will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the European Commission for its own production .
now the Status Quo of the previous regulation will be established largely .
special meaning have the successful paint of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; steel , the future &apos; is that a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; others must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the reform of emission standards , climate and employment targets are considering &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IG Metall leader Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry has suffered under excess capacities and a considerable price pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the situation continued to intensi@@ fy , as the world &apos;s largest producer in China , given the weak@@ ening domestic demand in demand to the world market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
European manufacturers set Chinese steel companies prize d@@ ump@@ ing .
during this spring the situation has somewhat relaxed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the one show inc@@ lined inc@@ lined inc@@ ense on imp@@ orters , for others , the economic prospects have emerged in China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
un@@ clear is how sustainable the price is re@@ covering .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
the prices have again stag@@ nating again .
the industry respon@@ ds to difficult situation with further costs .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp would last but not complete the closing of individual works .
about 8@@ 6000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
German steel manufacturers remain cau@@ tious in July despite increasing prices and increasing orders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , such as the Economic Association of Steel on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a short increase in May , the produced amount returned the second month in a row . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
production is by two percent since the beginning of the year .
the association expects to be improved in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation .
community , spirit , health : sing sen@@ iors good
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the singing of Ki@@ pp has accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in a school choir in the Leh@@ ra@@ tic study , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old is singing in a sen@@ iors @-@ choir . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; singing moves me - emotional and physical . &quot; she describes her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a rehear@@ sal , they feel balanced , cheerful and overall living , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by the way she does something good in doing her health and spirit .
for singing is right from several perspectives a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior league .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most sen@@ iors singing in ch@@ orus and share with par@@ ables the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
regular co@@ hes@@ ion can establish and maintain social contacts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because social and family structures in age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to arrange and organize , learn to the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of co@@ hes@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense .
there is a deep and controlled breathing exercise .
those who regularly calls his lungs as well as in everyday life is not so fast from the pu@@ rest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if it comes to preserve the sound of the voice in age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in elderly people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the federal employment community of sen@@ iors organisations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the older generations the common sw@@ inging had a much higher job value , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ enz frequently observed that the singing or listening of songs in old men plays a lot of memories , often associated with positive emotions of their youth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through song lyrics and especially tun@@ es , the affected people erup@@ ted to long out@@ lying events . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at singing , the head will also require special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , focus on your own voice and to a given rhythm and to adapt to other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially older people who live alone , do not only have to concentrate on himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another positive aspect is the recognition we lear@@ ns through the ch@@ anting in the ch@@ orus . H@@ ac@@ kler writes .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
even the self @-@ este@@ em grows through the singing in the choir .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; themselves to show itself : if I do long for something , I &apos;ll get better and watch over me - this experience strengthens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good reasons to start with the singing , so there &apos;s enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he thinks , little talent , says L@@ enz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you &apos;re not singing alone - with 50 sin@@ ful people , who hears when a sound goes to it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in search of the suitable offer , Sen@@ iors have different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone from the friend of the old friend , someone can join them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many cities also offer views of the cho@@ irs in the area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever wants to sing in a church choir can turn right to the church or church bure@@ tor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many veter@@ or@@ ench@@ y@@ irs are also found on the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you don &apos;t have access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbours may ask for help with internet research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who would have a desire to sing should necessarily join a ch@@ orus , reven@@ ge H@@ ac@@ kler .
the soul does well and has something liber@@ ating - that is true for any age .
cats react sensitive as cr@@ ater to scre@@ ams of the young animals
bi@@ ologists have examined in Hannover to find the effect the fin@@ es of cat &apos;s to adult animals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to their surprise , the male also didn &apos;t see the males too cold - however they always felt the same in contrast to the females . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
female cats can recognize the recognition of cat &apos;s bab@@ es at mi@@ th@@ aw the little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they react by ten percent faster on lute from k@@ itt@@ ens , which have found in great distress , such as scientists from the veterinary Academy and the Medical School Hannover ( MH@@ H ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ ater also respond to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evi@@ dently the acoustic differences between mi@@ tig@@ ation of less and heavily damaged young for the males are either not perc@@ ei@@ vable or not of meaning , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from MH@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she is the first author of the study published on Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a previous examination , the research team had already found out that the length and pitch of kit@@ ten @-@ cri@@ es differs from the ur@@ gency of their hel@@ pers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a total of nine adult hang@@ ers and eight children were observed from the MH@@ H animal species .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were used for a herd of children who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes , and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secon@@ dly they were confron@@ ted with scre@@ aming of stronger cas@@ ks , which were raised in addition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the researchers adopt their results despite the low sample test for conclu@@ sive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females even those who had not had their own offspring , re@@ acted on the cri@@ es , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they revol@@ ted faster to the loudspeaker when this Call of very er@@ reg@@ ain k@@ itt@@ ens played .
this ability may be con@@ genital or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have responded at all , &quot; said the Bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men on baby noise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were also some studies that women responded to sensitive to infants , regardless of whether they were mothers or not , reported the Bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ sky gra@@ bs with &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ash@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
Turkey has been issued an arrest warrant against the erst@@ while football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
a key football game takes place in Turkey for the first time after the coup attempt in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the Arch@@ du@@ el of Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ skis Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay , Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya is the official line clearly : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already in the susp@@ end of the acceptance test in July , the government , the everyday life of normal vou@@ chers could not be affected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this does not apply to those suspected of having suspected the susp@@ ect of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len movement , which is responsible for the attempt of put@@ sch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it will not stop before the football .
against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver the public prosecutor issued an arrest warrant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , the South America living in America will be accused of being a terrorist group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sü@@ v@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , head of the President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is responsible for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this applies to the initial state of emergency until October , but actually , most of the Turks do not have any effects on the life of most Turks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on public places throughout the country , Erdogan was declared on Wednesday for over . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sports is - as the whole country - divided into charm and opponent &apos;s history .
especially fans of the Labour club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the members of the President .
but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in view of dramatic experience in history , the stri@@ ving of military put@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the fans even agree - no matter whether your heart beats Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
at Po@@ kal@@ zi@@ eger &quot; Gala &quot; it will especially be arriving to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky .
the Cologne @-@ year @-@ old finished his sporty value during the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first season as Top@@ sc@@ orer of his association .
he scored 1 : 0 @-@ winner in the final game against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce .
the paper &quot; Fan@@ atics &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he completed the season in an excellent way and secured his team to the cup .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; the dis@@ appo@@ inting season took place for the record champion in a con@@ cili@@ atory conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the rounds of K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; differ too early in the Europa League . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the South of Li@@ g it was only six to rank six .
the season was not good .
the Pok@@ al was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have made this and that is the most important thing , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ sky . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the game year was better for Master Cra@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who ste@@ ers with 26 season qualification as an Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ sten chain the basis for the 14th title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 year old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the AC , Florence , under contract , the AC of Florence had announced only for the attempt of the political situation in the country after his EM holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Mario wants to come to us , he must only say it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; Club@@ man F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , the storms should be ready to disp@@ ense with an estimated one @-@ third of its to 7.5 million Euros , Or@@ man clearly stated : &quot; his salary in Florence can &apos;t pay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the authorities in a flower bed , the explo@@ sives went into the air before the local police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south west coast as well as in Ch@@ om@@ on on the southeast coast several injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one go from an connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attack bear the same manuscript , &quot; said Army @-@ General Dan@@ ai crit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee on Friday early in front of journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may be too early to express itself to possible moti@@ fs - probably , it is likely to do the deeds of Muslim rebels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also Thai media wanted to recognize a pattern , which is typical for bombing of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Thai police , however , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist uprising movement or with international terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is just local sab@@ otage , restricted to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather , one rather can assume that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past days , the authorities have kept secret references to imp@@ ending events in the south of the country - however they don &apos;t have been informed about the exact date and locations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
still be clear which group behind the attacks st@@ oned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police rejected their civil servants in the whole country to strengthen safety around important government buildings , airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and amus@@ ement parks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Thailand , there are still smaller bom@@ b@@ ings in Thailand , but they usually are not directed against tourists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over years of Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the reason of reason , the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends to provide the instructions of Thai security authorities as a result . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high safety risk ( safety level 3 ) was taken to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ cl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ar and its surroundings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following disputes between security forces and Muslim populations , not necessary to travel to these provinces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased safety risk ( safety level 2 ) sailed for the rest of the country .
the stops on Thursday and Friday received a few days after a controversial referendum on a military jun@@ ta signed by the military jun@@ ta .
this makes the military big impact in the years to come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jun@@ ta leader and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ Ch@@ a said , the bombs were an attempt to create chaos , while the country was moving towards stability , improving the economic situation and tourism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody uph@@ e@@ av@@ al , keeps himself good to have led the kingdom back to stability and order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the military did not succeed in the overthrow of Muslim rebels for years in the extreme south of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nearly a year ago , some people were killed in Bangkok on a popular Hindu shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the bloody stop of the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; is advised by the Federal Office for constitutional protection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to several national suppliers , the Constitutional Court has also shel@@ ters the group under observation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we look at the &apos; identi@@ fic@@ tional movement &apos; points for as@@ pi@@ rations against the freedom of democratic basic principle , &quot; said the constitutional chef Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ats of the German press agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the immigrants of Islamic faith or of the Middle East are diff@@ using in extreme manner .
therefore we observe the movement also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; identity movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn &quot; , &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; and the &quot; loss of its own identity through super@@ foreign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conserv@@ ation@@ ists in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thür@@ ingen - watch the &quot; identity &quot; already . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ats said that his authority have closely coordinated with the sovereig@@ ns in the decision .
&quot; groups such as the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; try to pick up their target group as they stand , &quot; said the constitutional chief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generally , Extre@@ ma@@ sts try to talk with you@@ th@@ ful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ right extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a concrete advertisement for your own thing .
propaganda must respond emotion@@ ally .
young people are sus@@ cep@@ tible in a special manner .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , several federal states reports about contacts of the &quot; identification &quot; to Af@@ D @-@ politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ats said it did not have any insights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species are only relevant from a certain point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain persons , the most extrem@@ ist , changes its target and so extrem@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crucial is , whether such persons contribute to the party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not recogni@@ zable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; facing the mark@@ edly increased criminal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee accommodations , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in recent years we have found that it can jus@@ tify the right @-@ terrorism structures .
there were the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be quite obvious that further legal @-@ terrorism groups or small groups , the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers or attacks from other right @-@ wing motives are planning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a nationwide or wide @-@ wide control of orth@@ a@@ ror@@ ism is however not recogni@@ zable .
the previous groups were developed on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ate was worried about that many assault on the account of people went , which did not appear in the right scene in appearance before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is wor@@ r@@ ying .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of the Tat@@ susp@@ ect attacks on asylum seek@@ ers may not have been known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated crimes or followers of the right scene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed off@@ ences that were perhaps politically in@@ different before , or for example , the CDU , SPD or left wing , which , however , have radic@@ alised radic@@ ally through right @-@ wing extre@@ mism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

this shows the bold appearance of RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ sized s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia is so slow that he was unable to see more in the TV pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the neck@@ line was selected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te was subsequently presented to viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended with a gap of 48 seconds and finished 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it was rather his not just sporting figure , which attracted attention of international media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ians got a special launch from the International Swimming pool .
this is distributed to make swimming in entertaining countries well known .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since in Ae@@ o@@ op@@ ies most sports@@ men run , Hab@@ te wanted to do something different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names made the lap quickly .
some media recorded him as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL der W@@ al . &quot;
based on a &quot; welfare state &quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ id &quot; The Sun &quot; made fun of him with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; by him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his time he struck only with a minute and nearly five seconds over the 100 meters of Fre@@ isti@@ l , there was no role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
during the 2000 Olympics in Sydney the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i joined media attention .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete in a run over 100 metres Fre@@ isti@@ l alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old met only eight months before Olympia , and never completed a long distance before the competition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the police , the 67 @-@ year @-@ old Ger@@ ets@@ rie@@ der had left their business on Monday at 17.@@ 30 a.m. and forgot to close a window on the ground floor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if nothing is to be established with the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already an alternative video . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he just drove into the holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential election in November , it would be either fl@@ aps , or I have a very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the candidate of the Republi@@ can in an phone interview with the US television sen@@ ders CN@@ BC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not rich for him at the end of the political correc@@ t@@ ness , the order is fine , said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , he signed the US president Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats , Hillary Clinton , as founder of the terrorist Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the latter increasingly formed more resistance within its party .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to rise to third parties in the sale , &quot; said a post @-@ spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company has been checking for months if they will be delivered by their self @-@ developed Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter , with letters and pack@@ ets , also to sell to other farms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; said it in late July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the consumer research company Gf@@ K is ex@@ changing his boss Matthias Hartmann .
the backs suddenly came suddenly - but not quite surprising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the difficult position of the market research company Gf@@ K left the chair that the chair of board director Matthias Hartmann is more uncertain , the longer the successes of his promises . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : after re@@ dis@@ appo@@ inting business numbers and the resign@@ ation of the management company the global number five of the industry is in front of a person@@ alised new beginning .
G@@ FR@@ P management head wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Council Ar@@ no grinding has already been merged with effect on September 12 out of the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the management board took over the management board of Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger on September 1 , the former board member . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is officially allowed to take over the position of a &quot; Executive Board , &quot; which is a successor to Hartmann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , on Friday , on Friday , the shareholders &apos; last had been forced dis@@ appointment over the continued success of years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Hartmann has been on the Gf@@ K @-@ top since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business year each shares will eventually be rest@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this would be the case with BMW , this would do the Qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; named it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to sof@@ ten their information according to the opposite side , which partly drove on the counter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bus came to the right from the road and did not slip into a ditch , like a speaker in the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , the people could not leave the bus , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - and under@@ lining from the previous cal@@ ann@@ um period may be equ@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; founded in all three se@@ wage systems with a very low se@@ wage , between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the small distribution basis , for example , expenses for several thousand euros would have a considerable impact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the se@@ wage in all three plants may be slightly dec@@ lining .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to its age , restoration and repair expenses in a substantial scope , not least due to their age of san@@ itation and repair expenses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for world cup , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Schmidt assumed that in the se@@ wage plant Az@@ endorf had to replaced the mechanical ventilation system due to damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pump had to be over@@ hau@@ led by the bottom of almost 20 years and almost 20 years in operation , the fla@@ p pond had to be installed and an additional ventilation option had to be installed in order to hold the water legal requirements in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these extraordinary expenditure , the continued service and maintenance costs came into account accordingly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which were clearly under the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses made clear that during the low se@@ wage plant in the three plants , the expenditure for operation and maintenance are fully en@@ forced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , Schmidt pressed the market community of great entertainment and wa@@ st@@ ew@@ ater treatment plants in the past 20 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned systems will continue to remain pre@@ k@@ ered according to stone houses , since one could not expand the supply zone of the se@@ wage system Fri@@ es@@ en@@ bach@@ tal to these plants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bulgaria in@@ wards for the first time in 8 months of inflation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; National statistics show that inflation was made in July 1 % on a monthly basis in July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) , and the first about zero since October last year , compared with a positive 0.2 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the annual average of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured after the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 , was 1.0 % , that is , monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was 0.2 % compared to July 2015 compared to July 2015 compared to July 2015 .
in July 2016 a price increase in the following groups of consumer goods were observed : food and non alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; Transportation and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell on clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routines ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prices remained as compared with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education remained unchanged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Snap@@ chat &quot; anim@@ e &quot; Effect as Asian caric@@ ature cri@@ tici@@ zed
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Snap@@ chat says that this Filter Ani@@ me insp@@ ires is , but some ob@@ servers say that it is im@@ sensitive towards races . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his filter tool , you can make Snap@@ chat around 150 million daily routines that are changing reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absur@@ dity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can transform itself into an pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the filters are bl@@ ur@@ red , in@@ trin@@ sic tools that produce more than 30 million m@@ oll@@ ers per day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all failure will be to the public .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Snap@@ chat filters have drawn up in the past criticism , in which they were accused that the app would propag@@ ate the Black@@ face conveyor or white skin as beauty ideal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as such a week some U@@ sers proposed a filter that gave them sli@@ t , false teeth and evapor@@ ated che@@ eks , called some critics a rac@@ ist cartoon by Asi@@ ans - &quot; Yellow War@@ ning &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they asked whether these repeated contro@@ vers@@ y hits a bigger problem , that the company has diversity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the news and the con@@ spi@@ racy were spread well on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat , that it would have de@@ activated the feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was a homage to anim@@ e characters , and not as cartoon by Asi@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but out@@ si@@ ders that have experienced apar@@ tism is remin@@ is@@ cent of the filter in viol@@ ating c@@ lich@@ és .
other refused the anim@@ e @-@ Compar@@ ison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an e @-@ mail she wrote Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose twe@@ et was widely distributed over the photos that the filter &quot; hurt and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added that , &quot; it is difficult to argue with the contrast of a very disgu@@ sting Asian caric@@ ature and the filter effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it shows that the filter has not been sigh@@ ted , but that the jel@@ ly has been drawn into the ab@@ rupt expression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company to cross these cultural pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the American culture seems to be involved in endless diversity and integration efforts , from the conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in the hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people , which are di@@ vers@@ ed in the race as their older players , could rather go out of what sensitivity to expect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters a picture generates that for a user is ins@@ ulting , &quot; it is much more difficult to remember that such things were un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu decided to delete their Snap@@ chat account as a product manager and engineer for medium , calling for others to do the same . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a essay for the medium and in a telephone interview , she said that ra@@ cial @-@ related contro@@ vers@@ y has also reflected a lack of diversity among adjusting practices with Snap@@ chat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the great part white , only male leadership and ended its essay with a has@@ h@@ tag : # Del@@ rac@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either they do not have various representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so that they can work there , but they are not in positions , in which they feel safe or safe to say what to say about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint which has left Snap@@ chat largely un@@ answered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company does not publish figures for diversity of its staff , and points to its status as private companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , it declined Snap@@ chat from having to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his employees , but according to a speaking company the company recently set a staff member based on under@@ represented population groups and internal integration efforts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu told her to leave her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users to tell you that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military command for@@ feit ISIS secret services - provides the Congress of Congress
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delegation of the United States Central Command General Command , to record an optimistic image of the war against the so @-@ called Islam@@ ist state in Iraq and Syria as it was the actual states of Congress in a report on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force on the Republi@@ can Advisory Committee , reported by great dis@@ satisfaction under Central Command Intelligence Command , reported by major dis@@ satisfaction among American efforts in the struggle against the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Central Command , short C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tamp@@ a , Florida to control the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; news service information that have been cor@@ rupted by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Commander ; posted periodic@@ ally a positive picture of American efforts against terrorism as it had the actual states on site and were more positive than analysis of other news services . &quot; published a newspaper article .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can Member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the executive positions in Cent@@ Com range up to the top tip of the organisation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ten @-@ sided report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi Armed Forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there are no direct clu@@ es to change the statement under Obama &apos;s instructions , it shows how analysts were exposed to the pressure of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , comments and statements before the Congress were clearly more positive than the facts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com has publicly known that a military recovery of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mos@@ ul , second largest city of Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , as much is clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ p@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress Center from Kansas , in a review . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the tips of Central Command will change the following reports to play through ISIS in Iraq . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Republi@@ can called the Task Force in life after them , that analysts were worried about manipulation from reports to Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings , and the investigations will continue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
further investigations of the Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the Secretary of Defense of Defense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the democratic members of the news service team published their own findings on Thursday , with some of the conclusions of the republi@@ can Task Force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com has created a superior process for the creation of subsequent assessment of IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , a member of Adam B. Schiff , in a review . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this process , as Mr. Schiff , delayed the publication of dic@@ ated reports , damaged the mor@@ ality under analysts and &quot; gave excessive time for different opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. ship and Democrats did not give any references to an intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com Anal@@ ysts , in regards to a specific political opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last August , the New York Times reported investigations through the Pentagon &apos;s general insp@@ ector , which were taken by Cent@@ Com Anal@@ ysts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press review of the Pentagon , gave no report on the Congress that the Ministry of Defense was not underway while the investigations of the Secret@@ ariat was still underway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he also announced that &quot; experts sometimes have detailed opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the news service and the Ministry of Defense have a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investigations have beyond the question of a successful air@@ campaign in Syria and Syria ( a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the accus@@ ations of the past year have abandoned the question of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than ten years ago , the criticism concerning the Islam@@ ist state , as a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , witnessed such a small cre@@ st in Iraq and thinking about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 to reflect on the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in rebellion against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker according to the statement of government officials , that these provisional refin@@ eries had no significant impact on the economic situation of the terrorist group , since these provisional refin@@ eries had begun to sell oil on the black market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this recognition was not published , the Times in September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was cri@@ tici@@ zed by members of the Legis@@ lative Council in a hearing before the Senate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General Austin was retired in April , and was replaced by the Central Command . Joseph L. V@@ otel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the USA won four fourth match in the Ho@@ ckey Ho@@ ckey of women playing a show@@ down with the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a day after they had shot three gates on Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American Feld@@ ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they couldn &apos;t remember that ever done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to people who retain their doors in memory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , they know : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equal to the Brit@@ on in their first place with their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the United Kingdom and the United States will succes@@ sively meet on Saturday in the last lap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ final , the game will decide which both of the two teams will gain the first and second place within their group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first plat@@ former will take the strong Dutch slightly longer from the path , which lead the other group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as always the game seems to go out on Saturday , American lovers have prov@@ oked a surprising host , four years after they landed in the last London games on the last of 12 places . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ am was part of this team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and she had three older sisters in her hands ( her two older sisters played at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the youngest in the history of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she missed the Olympics in 2008 , because she couldn &apos;t qualify for the Ka@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then came the year 2012 , where she went for her and her team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following year , Craig Par@@ n@@ ham became a British , coach of the National Team so that things began to improve things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a cultural exchange is a mental change and a physical change &quot; said B@@ am .
we did not have the work to work in London that we now have .
we have sli@@ pped the ru@@ dder completely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the goal in the first half of the game with a return from the near area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; India was without victory in the tournament in the game , but the team showed surprisingly tough and kept the play of 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball on the left flan@@ k , then moved to the center and put the ball in the gate to gain an American 2 @-@ 0 guidance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the entire tournament for the keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to book each other in each of the previous matches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has a run .
exactly like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on Saturday &apos;s outcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
am@@ id@@ st the Olympic Games of the Olympic Games on the tramp@@ ol@@ ines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wherever you are , as late as it is , the Olympic Games are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Rio de Janeiro &apos;s events are durable and un@@ ev@@ asive , a rapid season on competition and pursu@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if the Olympic tor@@ ch itself would be a burning rod , which is passed from the cross@@ bow to the tri@@ mmer to the tri@@ athletes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t turn off the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors during the waiting time in the coff@@ es@@ hop without hearing about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ cover@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had C@@ los . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a s@@ caff@@ old of women , could have been sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and welfare @-@ TV advertising , if he would have a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner or even F@@ genuine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California is fighting for the Olympic trampoline of the Olympic trampoline .
the Olympic flame is not lit any event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further from the center , partly in the shade , the sports which are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol shooting , ar@@ cher@@ y , bad@@ minton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will always have the chest swimming and may it reign for a long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if I tend to make a modest argument for my certain lovers , let me direct the attention on the dis@@ crete charm of the trampoline . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the trampoline jumping already has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had been in Sydney that many people had asked , did not know that there &apos;s a Olympic sport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the United States wins the competition , it has never won a medal in the trampoline and has succeeded until 2012 , who made it until the final round . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prizes for the men , the Chinese , and the Canadian the Canadi@@ ans for the women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trampoline jumping on the trampoline has a certain external side@@ car , partly because it sounds for a c@@ low@@ n@@ icious ear to the Olympic Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert but just an inherited enthusi@@ ast .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has humor@@ ously potential - the barren trem@@ or of his never @-@ ending monster , but also the Gra@@ zie of the gym and diving , which combines two sports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline which means much like a spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the winners will jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have to land a series of falling movements ( turning , H@@ alls , and sal@@ tos ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are judged according to the official sponsor gallery according to design , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two @-@ round athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio alike . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common Olympic V@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; med@@ al@@ lists had to move in their quest to gold , faster , upward and over , sometimes up to the target , sometimes up and back , up and down at the playground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they do not just ch@@ ase the finish line or the base wall , but also in the television trans@@ ference : the world or the Olympi@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the target @-@ oriented pursu@@ it is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic and it is enough to stir even a viewer to tears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also what I feel more sensitive to seeing this games as something we@@ ath@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trampoline offers a breathing spell .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he or she boun@@ cing off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut that goes up , then down@@ ward , then go up again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a competition , of course not without difficulty but during exercise , there is no hec@@ tic attack on the target , no v@@ aults in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant raising of time and gravity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is just as Zen as the competition can only be with the Olympic Games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the qualifying and final round of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming around 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the narrow@@ ly as part of a afternoon block at both days from 14.@@ 00 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the midst of the Olympic @-@ mania they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked at the general tum@@ ult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the consciousness of consciousness can only be achieved by the fear and the objec@@ ti@@ zing male athletes - as the male US Turner has recently changed , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan base to Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

violent protest in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators who demand political changes in Ethiopia suffered on non @-@ violent opposition from the government .
witnesses say that sixty prot@@ esters were killed during clas@@ hes with the police when they were killed .
is Ethiopia just going to break ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a consolidation of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but over the past few months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and spread themselves in more areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last week thousands of people stor@@ med into the streets , and desired fundamental political changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the government &apos;s response was un@@ merciful .
witnesses showed that polic@@ emen killed and killed un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in circulation , videos about the protests that are presumably taken from the last or beginning of this year , show how security men hit young people with sticks , while they were comp@@ elled to make a hand against a wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the UN authority for Human Rights is now demanding an incoming study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was always difficult to keep this country together and in future it will be even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror dangers on the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much western help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian business expanded in the remarkable pace .
his infrastructure has dras@@ tically improved - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if Ethiopia had anything but an example for democracy - human rights organisations have led to the government - the opposition in the country was reduced , where dis@@ si@@ dents were effectively put into silence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or driven into the wilderness of the wilderness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you supp@@ ress people and don &apos;t record any other options except to protest , Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in the Ethiop@@ ian Ethiop@@ ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth prot@@ esting .
a generation is prot@@ esting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are numerous complaints , which cover everything from soil use to the dig@@ ging in relation to power of ruling coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after an extensive choice of last year , the ruling party and their allies got the final seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , the tensions rise along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line requested hundreds of life in June . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear , separ@@ ati@@ sts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ ro@@ mo liberation front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den , which were more or less forced to arm the turbul@@ ence in recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several factors explain why feelings of bitter age after years of h@@ itting disease under the surface explo@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only in recent years , very many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with social media as cheap Smartphones have become more common and improved the Internet services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if the government locked access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular intervals , many people still can communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide themselves wherever they stop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were several young Ethiop@@ ians that they were so too prot@@ agon@@ ists gathered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two biggest Eth@@ n@@ ates in Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not a natural enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since A@@ onen prosp@@ ered the Am@@ har@@ as , who mainly come from Ae@@ o@@ ia , in politics and economy , while many Muslims are exploited and living in low@@ land areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this also changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are involved in coordin@@ ating under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest protests were held in Am@@ hara and O@@ ro@@ mos in regions of Am@@ hara and O@@ ro@@ mos .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , representing approximately 6 percent of the population , which are dominant in secret services , trade and politics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , was on the public until his death in a non @-@ public disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian prime minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was regarded as a tac@@ tical gen@@ ius , a man who could think of corners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; analysts predi@@ ct that , in particular , to use the early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use special officers to process opponents and to make them harmful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime is missing in this basic skill , Mr Ab@@ di said , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ethiop@@ ian new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen from relatively un@@ transparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Ethiop@@ ian , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
analy@@ st said that he did not enjoy the trust of the tig@@ ray @-@ controlled safety services .
many fear that the result will be more bloo@@ d@@ shed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such an u@@ pro@@ ar in 2005 , after thousands against elections prot@@ ested , according to analyses from the government , and subsequently stolen by the government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the following razor , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if it were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the development of development experts of Ethiopia their visionary infra@@ struc@@ tions , as the new pend@@ ulum train , as well as their measur@@ able progress in poverty ab@@ at@@ ement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , this does not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal ab@@ norm@@ ality of the Ethiop@@ ian government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and she takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ic town , von Tig@@ ray dominated business and hatred towards the Tig@@ ray will always be exerc@@ ised in social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
analy@@ st said that the protests in the US and other Western allies gain a pec@@ uli@@ ar position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neigh@@ b@@ oured Somalia , even though it was recently closed that it closed this base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want to collapse its allies in an already volati@@ le area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin Gr@@ at@@ ration . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump declar@@ es his asser@@ tion Obama was founded &quot; Sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to dis@@ assemble the last contro@@ vers@@ y that he claims his campaign , that his multi @-@ repeated statement , President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder of the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this clari@@ fication don@@ ates new questions to the communication skills of the presidential candidate , whether he is able to communicate clearly and communicate with the American public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also brings his fel@@ low@@ ds that endeav@@ or to take him during an event@@ ful phase , to explain in the pec@@ uli@@ ar position , which he could not have meant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after he had done the statement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump returned to the claim on Thursday , and was in interviews that he really did not intend to interpret the president and Mrs. Clinton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in an early morning twe@@ et Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was just sar@@ c@@ astic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the twe@@ et was contrary to the previous day when Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation totally seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to weak@@ ening the statement by taking him , the republi@@ can Presi@@ dential candidate wanted nothing to know about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last storm of critic@@ ising on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tried to direct the focus of his campaign due to falling demand values on the economic situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held speech@@ es about the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return to this topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ tons &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought Sar@@ cas@@ m already to his defense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of July , he drew strong criticism as he said , the Russians should listen to Mrs. Clin@@ tons &apos;s emails , but later he explained &quot; naturally , I meant the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to move the lingu@@ istic borders in politics , and then return to the need . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s one of his ways to test how certain messages from his fans will be taken as they arrive , and if necessary , &quot; clear &quot; depending on how the reaction fails . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert , who observed the speech of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I believe it is clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of shar@@ pen@@ ing the sound for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed an even corro@@ sive tone , since its survey values are gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a guided tour in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump , in general , tries to exc@@ use himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative expressions , he accused his critics frequently to dis@@ assemble or his humour mis@@ chief . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but while he was intensi@@ fied in the focus of attention during the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump Scher@@ ze have brought his loyal participation into the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ally his statements may be like pro@@ voc@@ ative . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rud@@ olph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ ump celeb@@ ri@@ ties , gave great effort to defend the candidates in a CNN interview from Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; said Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , so he asked for the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ ump@@ ani , if Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true in this sense that Obama was ISIS an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back @-@ ben@@ ches , totally false and therefore it happened , because he put the troops out of Iraq . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most ma@@ instream Republi@@ can try to argue that the government served under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton as an Foreign Minister , she allowed himself to extend the situation in the N@@ ear East under control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prior to the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and cast them back to him on each of his words and pre@@ set against him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he de@@ fied the poor , un@@ e@@ mmer@@ ing &quot; TV experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; Don &apos;t do it ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats mo@@ ck@@ les over Mr. Tr@@ ump sorry for a further proof that he is un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
once upon the price of the market a cafe in Green@@ point comes back
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a dam@@ aging Café in William@@ sburg , where you could only pay in cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi for 15 years of good coffee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the prices of his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ in front has been supp@@ ressed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the business So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , sold in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
local viol@@ ated it as the last loss in a genetically modified town .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is excluded and de@@ b is now a silk shop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when New York change is change , then it &apos;s also new creation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a re @-@ busy verb , opened in Green@@ point , less than one mile or north of its original location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepted credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new cafes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he started working in 2001 at Ver@@ b and stayed there until the end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a customer offered him to deliver money resources for a new outside order , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rodri@@ guez , 36 . kept a lot .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he would also experiment .
he led new ingredients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the menu , sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese and there are gar@@ ages like cap@@ ers and sour onions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are natural products .
the café offers no beer anymore but there are fresh juices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ guez said that he noticed an old current of old master clients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also forced by prices from William@@ sburg . &quot; he said .
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 and lived in William@@ sburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even after being moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after closing the verb , she gave a while for a while , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized that it was on coffee and at the culture in the Ver@@ b which pleased me , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they drink coffee again , even if she gave a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on this day , which is another new addition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a further long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he went there before work , and inevitably presented the same . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to seven , every day like a Swiss watch &apos;s watch and prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Foto Rodri@@ guez , he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nowadays , Ros@@ enthal gets still his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rodri@@ guez said that he did not make a res@@ ent@@ ment that the soap store has taken the old business room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indeed , the owner of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie creates a special soap for so@@ b with the coffee @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the coffee as an ingredient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think we will go on their offer . &quot; Rodri@@ guez &quot; said .
and the traditional Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new customer has translated the menu into Polish , and Rodri@@ guez said he has proposed to show them soon , so that his new neighbours will feel welcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the location also has further advantages .
a local ju@@ ic@@ o would like to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee into the bottles .
there is a chance that the café expands to an adjacent building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favor@@ ites . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer , and said that he was destroyed at the ground when the café was closed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the new Café opened , Wh@@ itt said that there was a new coffee feeling as a hom@@ ec@@ oming and a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had to smell &quot; he said .
the depres@@ sive food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his ascent to the President Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an Fein@@ schm@@ ecker , President Roosevelt would like a fa@@ inter for refined delic@@ ac@@ ies like P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water tur@@ tle soup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his menu on this day was a bit more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , mas@@ hed potatoes and dessert a pud@@ ding pud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering &quot; said Jane Zi@@ ck@@ man said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans , how they should eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food hist@@ ori@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; co@@ es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; worked out by Chinese cuisine in the USA , while brick was told in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential building at the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in the Har@@ per publisher , illustrates the story of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they showed culinary solidarity , when they meet with a repor@@ ter at the Eisen@@ berg &apos;s sandwich shop to dinner , a small snack in the Fla@@ ti@@ ron District , which has been in business since the IPO 1929 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brick , 54 , ordered a fresh che@@ eses about olive oil while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with mas@@ hed potatoes and vegetable mixture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the repor@@ ter was fried in the repor@@ ter , this couple found the couple for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; rich food were very popular &quot; said Zi@@ ck@@ man said .
there were pean@@ uts , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were made from an ingredient and somewhat cheap prepared to app@@ end the ingredient .
imagine so many pean@@ uts eat that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ e gr@@ in@@ est .
&quot; it must have laid down like lead in the stomach . &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
teams of women co@@ ves for male Fel@@ dar@@ es and it was served freshly baked past@@ ors for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were Americans that sent to a hungry Europeans during the first world war . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; draws the ways with which the country did not deal with this country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time in the food for the Americans a central , grac@@ eful topic , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the same ten@@ se the new bud@@ get@@ ing was : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and cas@@ ser@@ fs were too stap@@ le foods , the cas@@ serole were able to hide , as coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appe@@ tit@@ ular ingredients under the cre@@ amy sauce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by low cost dried fruit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meat , which was the center of the American kitchen for years , became a rarely known luxury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their pec@@ uli@@ ar mixtures were tried , as a cal@@ orie and nour@@ ishing satisfaction had priority to taste or even healthy food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during their research for the book , which includes recipes , prepared a dish from this era , baked onions with pean@@ ut butter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular supplement on lunch . &quot; says Co@@ e .
Zi@@ ck@@ mann continues to perform : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pean@@ ut butter and baked onions don &apos;t fit each other .
it was typical for many of the local staff .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as never before or since , bud@@ ger@@ ated budget - including Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 @-@ 1943 - the eating habits of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they published recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encourage women to turn the challenge of pamp@@ e how cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with carrots in delicious meals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a feast of historical delic@@ acy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the reports on the government &apos;s response to the hungry citizens are as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ eating . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa Farm@@ house kitchen in his kitchen , he sp@@ elled like the one million @-@ man man of the world to which he has become . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he liked Continental kitchen such as fish with cucum@@ ber sauce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in a very g@@ ild@@ ed dining room and bore a smo@@ king .
he was delightful and strange .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Roosevelt would have committed the same error , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to stat@@ ute an ec@@ amp with his stomach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as described in the book , a landlord has not described any interest in flav@@ ours by Mrs Roosevelt , that the White House also brought forth the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most prepared foods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , with Essen was rejected , as soon as the country came back to the legs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ ck@@ man , as well as science used in food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the couple was better understood by writing the book &apos;s habits in law mother in law - for example , how food could not throw away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; Co@@ e said .
Zi@@ ck@@ man re@@ minded me : &quot; you really did people ill . &quot;
there was the winding case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the dishes at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s were cleared , they went and cover a dessert , which they had prepared at home : the Pf@@ lau@@ m@@ end@@ es@@ o , the President Roosevelt to lunch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said gyp@@ sy and added that it was a nasty trick to miss a nice name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no proposed cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
everyone di@@ ved somewhat disgu@@ sting a spoon in a chew@@ y brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly it was not bad .
Co@@ e won three times a rash .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ tier@@ er , he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bombing of bombs @-@ attack : he was the hero of Aleppo
he put his own lives on the game to help others : Khaled Omar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the son of Aleppo , and Khaled Omar his life in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ris@@ ked everything to save others .
now the 30 year @-@ old died for a bom@@ bed attack of Assad &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Omar was a member of &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group that gave birth to almost 60,000 humans according to the picture newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 29@@ 00 Volun@@ te@@ er set her own life to the game , to draw people out of bom@@ bed houses and to help in the war zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civil servant that shows him with a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a su@@ ck@@ ling of a house in 2014 around the world .
it made the Syrian to the shining symbol in the horror of war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has never seen as heroes , but he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the real ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die for my death , I think that God will see a marty@@ r in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly before Omar himself fell victim to a victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the helicop@@ ters have rejected four facade bombs above the Alz@@ adi@@ a district which was filled with chlor@@ gas .
a woman and two children died ; seven people suffer from breathing not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now eliminate the po@@ ison@@ ous remains of the bomb , so that not children play with it , rec@@ ited the image of his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of Assad &apos;s regime had to make terrorists .
Greenland shar@@ k : the oldest whir@@ l is almost 400 years old
rare vision .
Greenland ha@@ y usually come to the surface in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on Mount S@@ anna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a 1 km / h across the North Atlantic - until today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Greenland ha@@ ie will get offspring only with 150 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Greenland shar@@ ks floating along the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean at an average of 1,@@ 220 meters in an hour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only when it arrives , the five meters long animal accelerates up to 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a Rob@@ be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this lifestyle seems that this long @-@ term lifestyle seems to be a pat@@ ron@@ age for a high age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the trade journal &quot; Science &quot; at least from a Greenland shar@@ k , which could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; ins@@ an@@ ity &quot; has been commented on the Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock this range of life that means for verteb@@ rates a world record .
although the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist susp@@ ects that Greenland ha@@ ges become stone @-@ old .
only the evidence was missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Greenland ha@@ ie are difficult to watch , finally they live mainly in the polar sea ahead of the spar@@ sely populated co@@ asts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius , they mostly dive on the surface in winter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers know a little about the lifestyle of Greenland @-@ ha@@ y researchers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her period of time , it looks like they buried six animals with a transmitter against S@@ val@@ bard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prey , these shar@@ ks are nevertheless : in the stomach of an animal they found the remains of an animal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you possibly hunt them sleeping animals or pat@@ rol by the reason of the ice cream and are looking for cad@@ aver that are from higher water layers below .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues now studied 28 Greenland ha@@ y , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as a by@@ catch of the North Atlantic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cen@@ timet@@ res long while the largest 502 @-@ cen@@ timet@@ res measured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to determine the age of animals , they analyzed the linear nucle@@ us of the shar@@ ks with the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this centre of the eye lens is already born before the birth of shar@@ ks , which will no longer be renewed in the proteins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two smallest shar@@ ks were notably a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the len@@ tic@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons try larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast with 220 cen@@ tim@@ eters long @-@ smallest animal , the len@@ tic@@ us contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapon , so it might be celebrating its 50th birthday in 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their len@@ tic@@ us , all bigger Greenland ha@@ ils had normal carbon @-@ 14 volumes being created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 cm long Greenland shar@@ k showed an age of 335 years , while the record shar@@ k might be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Greenland shar@@ k females only get offspring if they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the researchers were able to assign an age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 cen@@ tim@@ eters will probably be at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age with 156 years was determined , Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie is evident at least one and a half centuries time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is also likely to be the world record for verteb@@ rates .
such meth@@ us@@ al@@ em@@ es live mainly in icy waters and is not a co@@ incidence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also the previous record holder , a 211 year old Greenland wine , caught in its bacon a 120 years old Har@@ po@@ on tip , was caught up to Alaska . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to low temperatures , the organism of the living animals are often running on spar@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so you tyres later - and al@@ ot slower .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in cold water , the animals often become particularly great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal grows heat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much larger than in a gram elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives and should focus on how many offspring as early as possible , &quot; explains the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist scre@@ ams . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very large animal should always invest in a long life .
construction of the double pack
the municipal council in recent session has been concent@@ rating on topics around the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the committee conducted the communication of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; finally the marketing of tap@@ ing designated motor@@ homes can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the plot needs to be clari@@ fied and the requests have been clari@@ fied and the applications on surve@@ ying could be clari@@ fied , the sale of the plots in the residential areas &quot; street steps &quot; and &quot; Schö@@ na@@ u @-@ West &quot; ( section 1 ) are no longer in the ways . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the council is convinced that the B@@ auf@@ lä@@ ger in the rural and quiet residential community Schö@@ na@@ u , young families and touching sen@@ iors alike . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was called , building content can immediately sign in the town hall , on which the par@@ c@@ els will probably be advised in its September meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to also include inquiries to the res@@ ett@@ lement of further industrial enterprises , linked to the creation of jobs , decided to change the municipal use plan in sub@@ fields only in the spring of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the field of sub @-@ time the commercial area expanded by two plots towards the state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt profits from Bre@@ xit
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the City of Main , in the Competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg has the best opportunities to attract jobs and companies from London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt benef@@ ited most from the Bre@@ xit vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Comp@@ et@@ ence Financial Markets and Real Estate Industry of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain , whether monetary houses will continue to operate from London from financial transactions throughout the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
approval in the UK for the so @-@ called EU pass .
they just use great US banks .
several banks have already announced to store jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 10000 new jobs in the Main , the lob@@ b@@ ying &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; pays for five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , meeting the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks of the Eurozone , as well as other important authorities as the European insurance view E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk provisions ES@@ R@@ B . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris , the organization for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) was its headquarters , but this is less important for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the staff is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg heated a large fund branch of the fund as well as Dublin in the infrastructure .
Frankfurt was much easier to reach Frankfurt thanks to the big airport .
further to the town with easily available commercial real estate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris , it &apos;s not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Seine there are also 50 per cent higher commercial real estate mobili@@ s higher than am Main .
Frankfurt also offer higher quality of life than the competition with good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ranking of the company consultancy Mer@@ cer , the town was standing in place seven , Luxemburg on position 19 , Dublin on No.@@ 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if a quality of life is a question of pre@@ ferences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its strong position as a financial location for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors , &quot; says I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite the Bre@@ xit vote .

con@@ doms with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der , fireworks promote Dance An@@ anias
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nature Prot@@ ective in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to abol@@ ish eleph@@ ants , in people inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the method has proved effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which had trained as an idea for years ago by promoting volunteers in the north of Tanz@@ anian , a non@@ violent way to protect their houses and harv@@ esting , without hurt animals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many sp@@ ear have previously used to defend themselves .
Friday is World Phone Day devoted to animal protection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe the eleph@@ ants from their fields without damage the eleph@@ ants from Hon@@ ey@@ guide Damian Bell in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first two steps embrace the elephant with a tor@@ ch and blowing in a horn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when it is not deter@@ red is a so @-@ called &quot; Chi@@ li@@ cloud . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der mix with earth together with a fireworks body packed into a con@@ dom , whose end up to the ignition is turned out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it is ign@@ ited , the con@@ dom comes with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust on Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der into the air . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a breath in general already looks out to ch@@ ase the elephant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one last opportunity is a ver@@ fer , who shoots a gold fire@@ work into the air and causing a loud , bright explosion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Serge@@ ant unanim@@ ously decided : no ki@@ os@@ ub@@ au at the St. Go@@ ar Rhein@@ u@@ fer
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normally , the St. Go@@ ar investment plans of industrial incen@@ tives with Kus@@ sh@@ and - is still applicable at the core in the core town as significantly expandable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , an application for the construction of a sales ski@@ pper at the Rhein@@ u@@ fer in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine Falls , however , the city council decided to take one accord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically we welcome new business incen@@ tives , but at this location in exposed locations on the Rhine river , this ki@@ osk did not match up , &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CDU faction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jewish director defe@@ ats Berlin Hotel , because Israeli di@@ alling was removed from an Arabic &quot; invitation - RT News &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ased a media clock after he had reported that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had no list of Israeli selection , since it had requested Arab guests according to a staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; made his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
during his last stay Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel at the list of the hotel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wrote : Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a possibility to choose Israel over its own call center . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a declaration the director looked after the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the answer , which he received there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; like Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel said that the measure was a &quot; clear decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason that stood behind , solved more anger in the director . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; the employee was quoted from Lanz@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ merchant called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; says the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and dis@@ ma@@ yed by this event .
that is really very embar@@ rass@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that this has borne itself in precisely this hotel chain , is even greater dis@@ grace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no explanation is required .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; the right conclusions , &quot; said the ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident triggered a fairly large resonance on the internet , in which the people called the whole sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some under the Kemp@@ inski Hotel created that it would have given the alleged lo@@ dg@@ ings of the Arabic guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shame you , &quot; it was pointed out in a different article that the hotel , which is located on the clas@@ sy Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly showed all accus@@ ations of Himself and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; exc@@ used &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , &quot; Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct instruction to record Israel in the quick selection list , &quot; published the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a speaker of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds the country code to be added now .
police uses T@@ rän@@ k@@ as &amp; rubber bul@@ let against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; students joined the Brazilian city in Sao Paulo on Thursday , when they were gathered to demonstrate the government for the public educational system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police put the tear gas and rubber bul@@ let against the demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the difficulties began to work as a police officer , what led to the students that the police put rubber bul@@ ls and tear gas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the government &apos;s proposals in Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300,000 students will be implemented to save money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the protest participants saw Gra@@ ff@@ iti@@ ts against the provisional President Michel T@@ emer in walls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recent protests took place several days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to provide the suspended president Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , which had been reli@@ eved from the ministry by a vote of the Senate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade agreement between Moscow and Te@@ hr@@ an grew by 7@@ 0,@@ 9 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the international sanctions against Iran have been abol@@ ished , the interest in Russian companies increased strongly in the country to businesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian companies accept existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , another trading house is one of the largest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first five months of 2016 , he noticed that the trade agreement reached between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2015 grew by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , Russian imports in Iran increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent and climbed $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trade break was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan is a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the Russian Foreign Ministry issued about 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily on Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , an Iranian citizen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries , affecting the most important number in Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; said he . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , only a few Russians visits Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes that it will change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I personally can recommend the visit of the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who received the monuments of the old Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also on the way , the Min@@ is crosses the field , chap@@ els or churches always re@@ ast to sing together a song from specifically combined pilgri@@ mages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the nights the parish of the local par@@ ishes stood at their disposal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the stage points Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Heidi F@@ aller for a tasty and tasty dinner , and the breakfast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the second day he went to Gü@@ ten@@ bach on the second day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tags : to pass the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting path , had to drop approximately 500 meters at the time and thereafter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deser@@ ved reward was a barbecue at the bath in the evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after dawn on the fourth pilgrimage church in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter , he went to Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ately facilit@@ ated and happy , the Min@@ is met in the later afternoon at Frei@@ burger Münster and made the gate of mercy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to a small impulse God was than@@ ked here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the evening mass in Münster they were welcomed by the main destination Min@@ is by Ko@@ i , Markus O@@ bert . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the service the pilgrims could visit the Sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the Bre@@ is@@ gau@@ metrop@@ ole .
in the afternoon there was a train back to Hor@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end , all participants were agree that the days of spiritu@@ ality and a strong communal experience were marked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storm after home when the spectacle was shot gold for cycling
Scotland Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ cket last night in the men &apos;s team @-@ car at the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to Glory when the British Team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 year old from Glasgow took the anchor of his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y , made a legend hau@@ gh@@ ing , when he was stor@@ my back home to win a victory of the favour@@ ites New Zealand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four years ago , England claimed a sho@@ cking victory during Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympics medals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they repeated the trick , after they played in March at the train world championships in London , despite the withdrawal of Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the winner of the rider Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a result .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap that would temp@@ t Ki@@ an enam@@ el and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sk@@ inner was the man when they stayed there , when they saw potential in the Sc@@ enes that has now evolved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y triumph@@ ed - and Sk@@ inner sat in the qualifying rounds a Olympic Champion , but the New Zeal@@ anders winning the New Zeal@@ anders in the first round . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after his lap was round , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a strategy change made a major part of transformation , in which Hin@@ des in a higher gear went to slow down it , and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ho@@ y saw from his position as a BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they rose to the podium .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make me a name .
we set up a Olympi@@ sta@@ ord in the final round and conquered the world champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the triumph in 2012 at the side of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , he was told that he had deliber@@ ately dropped off the rail@@ road after a weak start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he returned this statement later and there was no ob@@ jection of England Ri@@ vals .
this time there was no problem with such a great victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels with all the UK flags on the tri@@ bun@@ ne as London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together in the last three months as a team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have come so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable , to win the Olympics again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect a successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the shape Kenn@@ y , it is in the field of possible that he repeated Ho@@ y &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold medals in a contest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23 March ( a apparently holy date for the British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were also born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s the same by Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint next step which will start today and will go over three days .
the 28 @-@ year old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels isolated alone to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; If he wins two gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the only med@@ al@@ lists during the day , but there were further good news for England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified themselves with the fastest power in four @-@ four @-@ kilometer race . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world record , which won in London in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , with the W@@ ig@@ gins with security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had cont@@ ended yesterday with officials before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his height . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the appropriate women &apos;s competition , the morning continued and ends , av@@ anc@@ ated Laura Des@@ p@@ ite , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Barker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the GB team is leaving its strong train team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games , and take a break at medals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , expectations for Rio were driven down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dra@@ mas played in the background , so the resign@@ ation of the technical leader Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April am@@ id@@ st the sex and the re@@ tire of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria Ab@@ let@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , when one sees itself the first night of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom it looks like then the legendary reputation GB@@ S , which reaches its climax once again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
future of the Portland sm@@ elter due to the repe@@ al of the energy contract
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the future of the aluminum sch@@ mel@@ ze from Portland , Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs by workers - stand on the game , as the plant operator will cancel the energy supplier and thus leaving all supply contracts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this step followed the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a sub@@ prevention for 20 years is running out in November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to 2,000 jobs in the facility of Al@@ coa in Portland are standing on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no less than 2000 work@@ places - direct and indirect - could be at risk at a closing time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it could occur to domin@@ ate effects , because melt around 10 per cent of the total power generation Vict@@ ori@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry sm@@ elter , which led to a closure of the Angel@@ es@@ ea power station last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sm@@ elter of al@@ coa lose money and risks confin@@ ement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this step follows the extensive spec@@ ulation about the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollars and last due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L , which delivers the large aluminium melting plant with his Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , shared that three more owners will announce their contracts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the facility is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , where the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ en@@ i Cor@@ p are holding smaller shares . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L is off that the plant will continue to operate in Portland , which means a further physical demand for electricity by the melt , &quot; divided the company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continues to say that the agreements were so called &quot; Backup &quot; , which should have entered into force from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month period of time that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L would assume that the contracts in the financial year 17 are to contribute to revenues , &quot; said the supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on the income on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L divided that it has already written the value of the contracts in the amount of $ 187 million in anticip@@ ation of cancellation , &quot; anticip@@ ation of cancellation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; ability to operate as &quot; the melt and the power supply to guarantee &quot; do not compromise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US company said that there was a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang which would have come into force in 2010 , even if it is still a declaration , why it has re@@ signed from the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the poor economic conditions in the industry , analysis of Portland sm@@ elter in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near Newcastle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in reference to the analy@@ st statements from the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen declared that Portland will use around 600 mega@@ watts and Tom@@ ago about 900 mega@@ watts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable decrease in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generator it would not be good , &quot; said he . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ h@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star is on the cover of the V@@ ogue
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ander@@ a Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted natural issue of U.S. V@@ ogue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ander@@ a , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der is and running on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on their Inst@@ agram account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover was crying , &quot; wrote B@@ ander@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unveil@@ ing of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or just Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans ) as well as in the presence of the most popular show@@ biz @-@ On@@ k@@ els and producers from Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) as well as in the presence of the most popular show of her sister : they all have a surprise @-@ party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this represents the cl@@ us@@ hing action of almost every birthday and a children &apos;s return ( Se@@ ac@@ nant brought the sentence to you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon animation at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to take part in this public@@ ity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to the issue of the V@@ ogue , a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans began . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kend@@ al &apos;s big sister Kim may have struck them what the V@@ ogue Cover is concerned ( her and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were on it in April 2014 ) but the Cover from the magazine is a league for himself .
the new issue for V@@ ogue is the most sold edition of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a circum@@ ference that resembles more of an image magazine as a fashion magazine , the output draws a large number of adver@@ tis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista ) from 8@@ 32 sides of the bearing ( 6@@ 15 pages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the disclosure of his Co@@ ver@@ stars will be so proud that in the last two years pictures of the magazine was in@@ scri@@ bed on the official announcement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women who had already been on the cover , Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s include . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , &quot; models &quot; as &quot; models , the celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oscar award winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but even at the low chance that Mrs Jen@@ ner is described as the &quot; breakthrough model of their generation - under the former category , it is in good company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people from today , who know how to rot@@ ate a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything dep@@ ended on Jen@@ ner ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are really talented women who distinguish themselves in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once who appeared on the last cover appeared with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
of course J@@ enn@@ er success doesn &apos;t like every success .
with her reality TV history J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position was always a little ten@@ se in the fashion world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June , the lonely Victoria &apos;s Secret Model Stephanie Sey@@ m@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did she named her &quot; the attributes of the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these feelings were reflected high when the message came out with the show J@@ enn@@ as on the V@@ ogue Cover .
but on the ground it seems to pass by passing on the point .
B@@ ander@@ a Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the V@@ ogue November issue .
it is a super@@ model in the true sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ ming from Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters sell images of themselves on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sold from her made images of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds &apos;s daughter to the magazine TV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in her leisure time she is seen in the Reality TV . presumably , to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
community centers indicate 16@@ 0.000 people every year
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 16@@ 0.000 of the funding of the country are considered annually by the municipal centres , while the industry remains on the impact of further mean short@@ cuts to already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Queens@@ land three out of five people - mostly older persons , immigrants , ne@@ edy workers , victims of non @-@ violence and those who have no means for un@@ fair inf@@ og@@ ations and liti@@ gation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ ly exploited , are ready for further cuts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; starting June next year , there will be no further 30 percent of its legal centres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the director of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Cent@@ res revealed that thousands of people were rejected each year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Far@@ rell told that the situation would only become worse with a repe@@ al of the government &apos;s decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Queens@@ land community centres are chron@@ ically sub@@ funded , which means thousands of people of important services that you need will be rejected , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ eable and impressive debts , families who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations - all these people have problems legal way and this survey showed that they do not need the help they need . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government will reduce the average by 30 percent in June 2017 , meaning that thousands of hel@@ pless people from Queens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for the General Prosecutor and the Federal Minister of the federal government as well as the sen@@ ators of Queens@@ land George Bran@@ dis , so that people might get the help they need with legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the regional government filled their commitment to lift funds to national average . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is now at the time to view the needs of community centres and their customer communities , as well as the government Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k is invested in this important work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign accused after an employee was accused of weapon
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new York : Donald Tr@@ ump campaign has been accused of alleged in@@ action due to its alleged in@@ action due to its campaign in February , while she was on tour in February in a Jeep in February . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident is described in a Indi@@ ct@@ ment , which was submitted by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i on Wednesday , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i had waited for months , that the matter would be internally controlled before it realized that &quot; that wouldn &apos;t happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign leader , Earl Philip , &quot; moved a gun , put his right index on the departure , and ra@@ mmed the run in Vinc@@ ent Kne@@ ec@@ eh@@ le , &quot; gave B@@ ordin@@ i in his accus@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after starting the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i realized that at least four more persons had the same experience with Phillip , issued in the indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired up to set damage , &quot; gave B@@ ordin@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the indictment consisted only two days after the Republi@@ can Presi@@ dential candidate , when he said a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second Am@@ end@@ ment People &quot; should take action when his Ri@@ val@@ in Hillary Clinton should be elected and judges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump campaign clearly stated that the media had torn his words out of the context , and that he would not rise to violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i complaint requires damages from the campaign for inf@@ rin@@ gement of care , and of Philip because of the violation and lead of psychological damages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Berlin / Schwerin : survey of countries elections : losing the SPD and the CDU
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , considerable losses for the ruling party SPD and the CDU were marked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to rule on the north , this is not possible after the survey in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party , and would have good chances to continue the government of government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD fell from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the survey , the party only paraly@@ ses about the CDU that could come back to 23 per cent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the third place is cont@@ ested between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the left hand would be 19 percent ( previously 18,@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the country day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in spite of slight losses , the green@@ ery was delayed by 6 percent ( before 8.@@ 7 percent ) again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented by 3 percent each in the country day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties , the SPD of the survey only came to 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CDU reached only 18 percent after 2@@ 3.4 per cent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are still lag@@ ging behind the Green Party with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Af@@ D would be the first time at the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties with 14 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pirates would miss the move in contrast to 2011 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and the Internet in Tim@@ lu@@ pe : the Nokia mobile phone call came to the market 20 years ago .
the successor today domin@@ ate the world - his manufacturer experienced a disaster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the device weigh@@ ed nearly half a kilogra@@ m , and was more than four times as difficult as an iPhone 5 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was th@@ icker and bigger , therefore it was not good in the hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary it was quite kno@@ cking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the built @-@ in memory was eight Meg@@ aby@@ tes , which would end today for about two rare @-@ resolution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by now an iPhone is delivered at least 16 gig@@ aby@@ tes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator &quot; came exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a few Euro fans can still buy the devices on the Internet , but they are somehow from the Stein@@ age of the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
20 years ago the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the product of the Finnish cell phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the C@@ eb@@ it computer fair in Hannover as &quot; Office in the West Bank format . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received via fax . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even access to web pages was possible with HTML browser , even though qu@@ il@@ ingly slow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be opened like a laptop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then found a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prize was quite proud of the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , which is about 1400 Euro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the average price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
nobody could see in August 1996 that communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
the cell division of Finn@@ s experienced an un@@ preced@@ ented disaster . finally Microsoft has sold and handled at Microsoft .
the market domin@@ ate the market today that came all much later than Nokia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everywhere and everywhere , this is today for very many people everyday life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sold about 1.4 billion units , on Samsung and Apple alone , alone 5@@ 55 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; global sales with devices is around 400 billion euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the well @-@ running business of the countless app provider and the telecommunications company will come .
around the smartphone has been created a whole industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crucial breakthrough on the mass market was only beginning 2007 , back then Apple boss Steve Jobs announced on Mac @-@ World the introduction of i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he promised three units in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communications communic@@ ator , all via touch screen easy to use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the winner of the Apple began , and today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry used to domin@@ ate the market .
they van@@ ished up to battle Black@@ berry has to fight .
the sa@@ wing have now Apple and Asian providers as Samsung .
the smartphone is a self @-@ understand@@ able for 20 years after its invention .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on average , each Germans today looks at his cell phone 88 times a day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must all learn to pick up the smartphone even once , &quot; said Jan@@ ina ball , in the Siemens executive board for personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent us@@ ability is now considered to be a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must ste@@ er the Olympic spirit and extend He@@ ath@@ row
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ ath@@ row is not only involved in our local communities and in London , but all the land of renewal and prosperity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , it was the biggest attraction He@@ ath@@ rows , just as we had a great effort in 2012 to ensure that all of our nations and regions benef@@ ited from playing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Olympics brought great advantages for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that will come back , by creating new opportunities for local and companies nearby He@@ ath@@ row . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities , we will create 10,000 new teachers , will create 40,000 new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they were ahead in London 2012 , there will be such a think that the challenge of enlargement He@@ ath@@ rows is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been told that England will never be ready for the Games , and that we will be touring on the world stage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two people had wrong in 2012 and they will also lie wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to dis@@ appearance ; but He@@ ath@@ row answered each of him asked .
as the Olympic Games the He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual infrastructure projects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expansion is a possibility to create up to 18@@ 0.000 new jobs , £ 211 billion on weather growth and to leave an legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and throughout the UK . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have implemented a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has been implemented a £ 11 billion wage investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion at private investments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
London &apos;s London games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time that we ste@@ er this Olympic spirit and create He@@ ath@@ row and create a legacy of skills and jobs , which can be proud of England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz &quot; and mouse play &quot; concerning ad lock
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for companies who earn money with online advertising money , according to any of the software manufacturer attempts to b@@ ypass ad blo@@ c , a &quot; knee and mouse game &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , just two days after Facebook , Ad@@ block Plus released a blo@@ g@@ post in which it told that users could update their filters to block advertisement in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook was shared that his desktop page would modify the coding regarding his adverti@@ se@@ ments to make it easier to make any part of advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a blo@@ g@@ post wrote the speaker of Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her clas@@ h has been underway since the invention of display @-@ lock@@ ers underway , and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest company has left the fight for social media in the struggle , is a strong indication of how wor@@ r@@ ying indicators for the industry has become . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ i@@ val and Adobe , around 200 million people are using display cases ; nearly four times as much 2013 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion daily users active users who access Facebook on their mobile devices , hand @-@ adver@@ t makes 84 percent of the advertising revenue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company has no effect on ads on ads on ads , because mobile ad blo@@ cker have no effect on Fac@@ ebooks mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agram , a speaker was shared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advertisement on Desktop PCs makes a sufficient amount of income , so Facebook is the investment of such a stri@@ de worth it worth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook told that it would update its &quot; ad pre@@ ference tool &quot; to have more control over them zi@@ pped advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , Facebook said that Ad@@ block new filters would be wor@@ r@@ ying because they would not block any content on the page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; shared a spokesperson on Facebook in an email message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad blo@@ cker are a bl@@ unt solution , which means that we have focused on the developers tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , to control more control in the hands of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
woman at pres@@ umed suicide on Swiss highway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the motorway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police call witnesses , after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday was attacked by several vehicles on a highway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on the A1 in the vicinity of Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d just after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman lay in the dark &quot; in an act of des@@ pair &quot; on the streets , and were taken by several cars , the police declared in Vau@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is obvious that a Swiss in the age of 49 years , including several vehicles , including a truck , would have to kill himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she died still on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police declared that these as well as each witness of the incident to report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was opened in a preliminary proceedings , which a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter divided the Le Tribun@@ e de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it remains however to wait if one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is something that the prosecutor must decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers cannot be held ac@@ coun@@ table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in each of the two cases - when one person ran in the dark on the highway , he decided not to go out that a pede@@ stri@@ ans run in the middle of the night , as it was in the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year a police officer was acquitted of the negli@@ gence , after she had killed a man and had killed a night at the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 22 year old sacrifice was drunk , and has become un@@ conscious of the road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court found that the polic@@ eman -- that had answered a justified way -- was on a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; totally exceptional and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; said the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone , who has further information on the incident on Thursday near Morges , should register with the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
NASA Kli@@ mam@@ y : Venus once was hab@@ itable
the Venus was probably once hab@@ itable according to the projec@@ tions of a new NASA cluster .
scientists at Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies and NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms to re@@ semble climate researchers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have suffered similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the latest simulation indicates that Venus might have had a thin , er@@ d@@ like atmosphere and still slowly moving . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the model also lighted the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the planet probably had more dry areas than the earth , but had once enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and prevent rapid evap@@ oration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent matte inside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow rotation of Venus will exp@@ ose their daily side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says G@@ ISS scientists Anthony Del Gen@@ io in one press release . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds which provides the surface of paras@@ ols . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the result are average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than the Earth today are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the model brought forth a history of Venus , which has been similar to evolution earlier by planet@@ arium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it was supposedly inhab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their oceans evapor@@ ated and its water vap@@ or was burned out of ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as their hydro@@ gen , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained back with a fatal greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the researchers gave the results of their new Venus C@@ ells at Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy works as a trainer of Aval@@ an@@ che
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , Patrick Roy came back as a trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and introduced a minor involvement in the teams &quot; decision process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the association will promptly look for a new trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past three years I have met my duties as chief trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che , with energy , passion and authentic@@ ity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have long been thinking about how I could improve this team in order to give it more depth , and to bring it to higher levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to achieve this , the vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organisation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must also have a decision on decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are not currently being met .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sak@@ ic , who had been hired by Roy on 23 May 2013 , than@@ ked him for his team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Patrick today informed me about this decision , &quot; said Sak@@ ic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we appreciate all that he has done for our organization , and wish him only the best for the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy was awarded by the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adam Awards as the best trainer of the league .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he took the club on 112 points and on the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was hit in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota and missed in each of the last two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Aval@@ an@@ ches posted a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the season 2015 , and fell behind the Wild for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ öl@@ ers take back talks again and continue to strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as regards the re@@ mun@@ eration for North Sea workers , all the parties involved in a round table round will put the negoti@@ ator on the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally based on platforms in the North Sea that are operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Wood Group , as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT unions , can confirm that we have agreed to re@@ begin the wick@@ ing process of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will stop some all @-@ day meetings in the coming weeks , beginning next year to re @-@ start the problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the unions told that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts up to 30 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wood Group has cut down the rates to its contra@@ ctors in the North Sea by around 9 per cent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s ratings follows a 10 percent reduction in on@@ shore @-@ contra@@ ctors in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said that additional cuts to the company gives the required space in order to come through the market down@@ swing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for its part , Shell has released their plans for thousands of people and plans to raise its activities in up to 10 countries as a result of his meg@@ awatt financial company with the British energy company BG Group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; energy companies are under pressure due to the lower raw material prices under pressure , an economic situation which was forced to leave the European Union by decision of the British in June . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Scottish Parliament of Parliament Dave Anderson met at the beginning of this week with workers &quot; leaders to discuss one of the greatest working forces , which took place since a generation in the North Sea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the North Sea is important for the regional economy . he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not only for few , &quot; said he in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion is expected to spend new projects in the North Sea in comparison to an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures rot@@ ations of stars in the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler @-@ Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers , the most complete catalog of rot@@ ational rates under the stars of the star on the P@@ lei@@ ades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new data help the astronom@@ ers understand why the stars in the star clusters are rotating at different rates , as well as in which context the rotation periods are standing with the planet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope that we experienced by compar@@ ing our results with other star@@ dust , more about the relationship between the mass of a dying , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s Dem@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light years away from the earth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many stars in this star cluster , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , reach adul@@ thood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are now fastest in the quick@@ est .
these gri@@ pping stars explo@@ res large amounts of star@@ ches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a star is aged , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rot@@ ational rate of any death by taking the time between the appearance of a recognis@@ able star -- like sun@@ spot -- recognis@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the newest catalog of rot@@ ational rates showed that massive stars slower than less massive stars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Reb@@ ull is compar@@ es the stars with dancers with larger stars slow@@ s down as smaller ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to tend to be massive , whereas Reb@@ ull said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close to that it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers one anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; Reb@@ ull said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s still much ahead of us . we would like to learn more about how , when , when and why the stars slow down their rot@@ ational rates and speak their &quot; dancing shoes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ ull and her colleagues in three newspaper reports detailed discussions about their latest analysis of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a controversial Bas@@ eball Star will come from
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tears ran at Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the US Bas@@ eball Star in best days from base to base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after his emotional return announcement , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old professional will carry against the Tamp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys last time the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say &apos; Good@@ bye &apos; , explained the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participant of Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in three times Rodri@@ guez was elected to the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his signature among a tenth year contract has been giving him 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until the end of the contrast on December 31 , 2017 , he will serve as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a player it paid Rodri@@ guez long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us with 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) and the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed to earn some mil@@ estones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e Ma@@ ys , only two additional bas@@ eball players show similar values in the most important statistics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be included in the rest of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for as successful Rodri@@ guez - the nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - on the field , his appearance is fought outside of the square . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star of &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; which was banned from 2001 to 2003 , was banned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in August 2013 , due to a active involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal at the end of 2014 , it was closed to 211 games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ guez is regarded as the main susp@@ ect , for years having received an anti @-@ aging clinic in Süd @-@ Florida . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a law@@ suit the lock was reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done a favour for 2014 , because I &apos;ve played 20 years without a break , &quot; Rodri@@ guez said at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even his farewell @-@ days go not sil@@ ently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while many bas@@ eball legends have played the big stage in her last game , Rodri@@ guez had to sit on the bench . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes an attempt to win any game &quot; says Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Rodri@@ guez , who was married with the actress Cameron Di@@ az were married and the ratios of Kate Hudson followed , sympathy and fans of the Y@@ ank@@ ee @-@ Erz@@ riv@@ alen Boston Red So@@ x . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to .. &quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od . &quot; we sang the follow@@ er at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ guez team .
Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first d@@ oping cases
caught : because of a positive d@@ oping rehear@@ sal Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland will not start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official d@@ oping cases .
a gro@@ omed ath@@ let would have won almost a medal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the seventh race day , the first official d@@ oping in Rio de Janeiro &apos;s Olympic Games have become known . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese Schwi@@ mmer@@ ing Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacle in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ li@@ the@@ ber Adrian Ziel@@ inski have been tested positive in Brazil - just before the beginning of the most critical analysis of the Young Ath@@ le@@ tics competitions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ch@@ en last Sunday , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de has been proven to be used as a mas@@ cul@@ ating agent for d@@ oping sub@@ stances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the International Sports Court CAS confirmed on Friday afternoon with its exclusion from the Olympic Games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly , just about 0.@@ 09 seconds , it missed the bronze medal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en had to take part in the prec@@ urs@@ ors of over 50 m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ch@@ en has requested the opening of the B @-@ rehear@@ sal and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; seriously and demands full co @-@ operation with the investigations , &quot; cited X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will accept the judgment with the International Sports Court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time in history , the IO@@ C is not responsible for the san@@ itation of the athletes with positive cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also during the night of Rio , the news about the positive sample of Dan@@ ek@@ owa went through , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is innocent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplement , &quot; the Ath@@ letin stated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report it is said to act in the forbidden substance for the dop@@ ant of the EP@@ O .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dan@@ ek@@ owa has been sus@@ pen@@ ed provisional , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ rehear@@ sal also should be positive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s prime minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w signed up immediately with criticism of the ath@@ let &apos;s word .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the ath@@ lete does not drag the right conclusions , &quot; said : &quot; we are Bulgarian under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all wei@@ ght@@ li@@ fter from the chron@@ ically dou@@ bling nation may not be able to participate in Rio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &apos; was also known , the London Olympic vic@@ tors in class up to 85 kg was tested like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days before positive to the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both include in@@ ges@@ tion , but they are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the start of the ath@@ lete , Dan@@ ek@@ owa is particularly serious blow for the reputation of the entire sport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world association IA@@ AF had prohibited the entire Russian team up to an exception because of systematic d@@ oping the start , also the fi@@ du@@ fer@@ nal Kenya has produced numerous bad news in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the swimming pool the earlier contracts in China had also taken care of violent clas@@ hes between athletes .
French Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang har@@ sch .

&quot; I have no time and no respect for D@@ oping Bet@@ rü@@ ger , &quot; said this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sun was positively tested at the Chinese championships in 2014 on the stimul@@ ant tri@@ met@@ ac@@ ine , but had to sit only a three @-@ month lock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de pressing h@@ ack@@ ers your sol@@ vent
programm@@ ers of en@@ press@@ way malware are currently attacking specific companies - and are successful in doing so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a recent survey of the Virus @-@ defense specialists Mal@@ wareb@@ ytes among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surve@@ yed companies were at least once , partly with multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany almost 20 percent of companies had already been aim@@ ing for a ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 40 percent of the victims paid will@@ ingly to be able to use the perpet@@ rators to be able to use the challenged systems and data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crimin@@ als speci@@ alise their black@@ mail software according to the observ@@ ations of Mal@@ wareb@@ ytes Anti attacks on attacks in corporate networks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are successful there , the potential to obtain ran@@ som is significantly higher than by private users . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we currently watch a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of damage software &quot; explains Mal@@ wareb@@ ytes head Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot;
in 2008 most of Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send adverti@@ se@@ ments .
then discovered the perpet@@ r@@ ator software for itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only were private users the target , but the change to company attacks took place during the past few months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works after a simple pattern : once active on the computer of an offering , it searches for un@@ long changed files like Word@@ - , Excel or database files , as well as to archive images and videos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these files encryp@@ ts the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als .
the software will then be presenting the demands of the black@@ mail@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get the end @-@ key code to the files , the victim must pay money - usually in the form of the Cr@@ yp@@ t Bit@@ coin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but where for private users the personal photo database is on the game , it is about companies for sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production is shut down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly increase the damage caused by a ran@@ som@@ ware .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 percent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to break the business activity , in which case were people in their risk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany already several hospitals were victims of attack , whose patients can be threatened by the loss of health haz@@ ards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we say to the victims always : pay not paying her only the problem , &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , get their data again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the requirement of perpet@@ rators in operation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the h@@ ack@@ ers turn again and try everything to build a good reputation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a recent study , the security researchers of F @-@ Secure have examined the use@@ able areas and the contact with black@@ mail@@ ers and come into the result : the perpet@@ rators actually attempt to build a kind of service to make more money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they explain how they can pay via Bit@@ coin , arrange free @-@ to @-@ access web sites freely accessible via Bit@@ coin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and will buy private people after payments of a few hundred euros , companies have to pay hard @-@ negoti@@ able and five @-@ digit sum@@ s to reg@@ ain their data un@@ encrypted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion , the h@@ ack@@ ers are always professional and share the work , explained by safety experts at Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski by antivirus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware within a week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is more likely that it is three or four people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the programm@@ ers sell their damage software in the form of a software building block to the actual black@@ mail@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the previous malware Kit developed by malware itself , co@@ uns@@ elling and additional tools for a one @-@ time , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; included in the scope of delivery is an adap@@ t@@ ool , allowing smaller configurations , looks and bran@@ ding , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the black@@ ma@@ iler are then looking for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the freshly caught software under the victims .
we live in a service industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so you log in one of the forums in the underground , buys the set of a crime and also asked another to install the software on as many PCs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
payment is done per infected machine .
&quot; usually the crimin@@ als use sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
Ran@@ som@@ ware &apos;s risk is now well known for many companies that secure their data better .
over 50 percent of the companies &quot; IT @-@ leaders in the Mal@@ wareb@@ ytes Survey trust you to get ran@@ som@@ ware by file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
accordingly the perpet@@ rators are pursued already new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data is not sufficient for successful awakening , the perpet@@ rators instead of sensitive data such as client lists or pricing calculations , &quot; explains Mal@@ wareb@@ ytes head Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the damage of damage depending on the type of data is much higher than before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rators in future could take totally new goals on the internet of things .
at the Hack@@ er@@ conference Def@@ con dis@@ used security researchers as they could get connected to the Internet with connected thermo@@ stat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of winter , the un@@ folding of such a blocked heating could be quite a ran@@ som value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the perpet@@ rators then block a whole production line in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday dust
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the little HR @-@ V Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little cou@@ pe and even the versatility of mini@@ vans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds pretty over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V seems rather small , passengers in the front row as well as in the rear have a lot of space , it works in no place tight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials of the interiors are well processed and are comfortable , only the cockpit @-@ top is something off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only a luggage compartment at 4@@ 53 l , at the reverse side rests , but there are the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is less magical when it sounds : the seat areas of the back bench can be folded up like kin@@ os@@ es@@ sel , and thus offer storage space that is from the ground up to the ceiling 1.@@ 24 m high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the luggage compartment can be loaded well , but the load height is 650 mm higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tested 1.6 @-@ l @-@ diesel engine with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges very powerful .
however he should al@@ ign his work more silent .
the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is encouraging .
there is another motor@@ isation : a 1.5 @-@ l gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behaviour is balanced and a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering is unlikely to be more direct .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the full connectivity exists only for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App integration and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI @-@ jack are located under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to achieve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top @-@ diesel are fine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Air@@ line is not responsible : crash on air@@ gas bridge
an Air@@ line is not liable for the overthrow of a passenger on the aviation bridge .
the Higher Regional Court Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) was ar@@ gued only with dangers .
the caus@@ al had broken up with the overthrow of a knee injury .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , the court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the airline had no compensation to pay any compensation .
event : when paid by the organizers
ill vac@@ ation@@ ers only get money back after their journey if the cause of the disease is dou@@ bt@@ less in the hotel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this is only the case if more than ten per cent of the guests will indicate the same symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the negoti@@ ating case , a family was heavily ill with diarr@@ he@@ a and vom@@ iting the second day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their disease led the vac@@ ation@@ d back to a defective K@@ lä@@ ger , which supposedly poll@@ uted the sea@@ water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the family was the view , the trip was so poor and def@@ endant against the Organ@@ izer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ lä@@ ger had no success in front of the court .
although the se@@ wage plant was indeed defective .
but the organizers told her first shortly before leaving the K@@ lä@@ ger .
he had to assume that the sea water was fine .
thus he did not hurt his information .
especially in the samples of water no imp@@ uri@@ ties were found .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by infection one another - belong to the general risk of life .
only 38 were sick of 6@@ 91 guests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , following the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have worry about further attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state must be pru@@ dent and decisi@@ vely respon@@ ding to terror .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sure , our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators with hatred and split . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this triumph will not allow terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if crimin@@ als have to leave the country faster , but the safety and strength of the population for refugee policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve a implementation of proposals until the German Parliament election in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another person@@ alised rein@@ forcement of security forces , namely &quot; medium @-@ digit mag@@ nit@@ ude over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympath@@ ies for terrorism must again be under penalty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; video surveillance is to be improved , the weapons is so amended that the purchase of weapons in the Internet will be amended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last much discussed sec@@ rec@@ y for physi@@ cians should remain in preserved according to de Ma@@ izi@@ ères .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he wants to search for solutions in dialogue with the medical tes@@ tic@@ ulture , as the end@@ an@@ gering of citizens can be reduced , he said with a view about psychological re@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to opp@@ ose a radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister holds a better social support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
teachers would have to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ zed people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the prosecution of crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dar@@ k@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère plans the deployment of lab@@ elled investig@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything , which contributes to the safety of safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Minister of Interior clearly expressed itself against shareholders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a cat@@ chy for the char@@ gers in the CDU / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said the newspapers of the spark media group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , calls from the Union to an Bur@@ ka ban and the abo@@ lition of a double nationality was rejected earlier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a general prohibition of full @-@ healing he is proble@@ matic for constitutional law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t offer everything you reject , and I reject the wearing of Bur@@ ka . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can talk about rules , about road traffic or witness to court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green @-@ chief in Simone Peter threw the Minister , wanted to simul@@ ate new anti @-@ terror package and ability to act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; fleet pro@@ ver@@ bs , and a mer@@ ging of stay to the right bring people in this land no longer security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the free@@ way br@@ inger
it st@@ alls regularly on the highway - here &apos;s a picture of November .
but this is supposed to change : the rule of law is to be extended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is good news for all the car drivers , who stand in the professional traffic on the surrounding road every night in the St@@ au , when they drive on Highway to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; road construction extends on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) , between the Hammer street and the descent Wes@@ eler road is the right lane track around 700 meters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
drivers can then face right from the Hammer street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the big advantage : the transport is split early , thereby improving the overall procedure on the covered section of the highway 51 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the District of Münster @-@ West .
the road@@ way on the Zu@@ br@@ inger was annoying the drivers especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from working days , the back @-@ back reaches the path through the Alber@@ slo@@ h path and sometimes also beyond . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason is the needle &apos;s eye on B 51 just before the descent Wes@@ eler street .
from here traffic can only be lowered on a single lane via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be rebuilt in a three @-@ quarter years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason : static calculations resulted in that the bridge has no longer the required lifting force , to take up the heavy traffic double @-@ sided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the related stakeholders , the country can &apos;t tell the competent company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , to count years , the bridge has an official balance duration of up to 20@@ 34 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for extension of the right to rule , the country is deliber@@ ately chosen the bu@@ st@@ worthy time in the school holidays , because with disabilities may be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday and on Wednesday , traffic will be run on the site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which has set up cultural integration of young people with a refugee and refugee background , has the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster through this project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the young@@ sters are between September 2015 and March 2016 , amongst others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and speak little German . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to chore@@ ographi@@ es , scenic images and video animations , it would have been possible to follow the course of action , so the press release of the Young Theater Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg from spra@@ ys and the boy theatre will work together within the upcoming season of a musical theatre project .

rain instead of star col@@ d@@ olls : hope for weather repair
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the weather did the star @-@ picking @-@ gu@@ ck@@ ers in the south west of Germany at night , a stag@@ ger through the bill - but there is still hope . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the night was po@@ or@@ ly suited for clouds and rain , the chairman of the ob@@ servatory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the weather will be good , then we &apos;ll see many const@@ ern@@ ers in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the stell@@ schu@@ ppen it is Per@@ es , which belong to the fastest star cliffs with 2@@ 16@@ ,000 kilometers per hour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have their names , because they seemingly come from the constellation Per@@ se@@ us , that goes in the north east . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
relaxing Night : tips against sleep disorders
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the evening you roll up forever , at night you wake up for hours , but in the morning it is far away from the w@@ ak@@ age to think any more sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is all other than relaxing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyway , one is with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , approximately one quarter of adult sleeping disorders and over ten per cent , their sleep is frequent or permanently re@@ covering . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are several kinds of sleep disorders , and there may be many reasons underlying them , empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eks , member of the German Society of Schla@@ ff@@ ing and Sle@@ ep Medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , what can be seen below , is the in@@ som@@ nia , so an entry and a sleeping troub@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just feeling sle@@ epy many people as un@@ satisfactory or in@@ adequate , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , member of the German house Association with practice in the lower Sax@@ on Var@@ el . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what &apos;s behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind it can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ oral factors but also medicines .
not rarely is the sleeping disorder expression of another disorder .
&quot; very early w@@ aking is frequent with depression frequently &quot; says We@@ eks .
and it can be that various factors are op@@ pressing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc can be bad , every two to three hours starts and starts to sal@@ ute about everyday problems and assu@@ res , We@@ eks gives an example . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should you consult with sleep disorders ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone does not sleep well over a period of a month in at least three nights per week and will be ham@@ pered by day , says the doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the im@@ paired can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , un@@ slept , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood fluctu@@ ations or physical complaints such as stomach or head@@ ache . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to ease the sleeping troub@@ les , it is important to find their causes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as treatment options include behavi@@ oral changes , cognitive behavi@@ oral therapy or also medications - classic fl@@ yers only in exceptional cases and more than two weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is hardly any sleep medi@@ cs in Germany , empha@@ sizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etz@@ e , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary Research Center of Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why one should first apply for sleeping problems to the family doctor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he can clari@@ fy with examinations , whether problems have a physical cause . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who should go to Schla@@ fl@@ ab@@ or and what happens ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for exam@@ ining in the demo@@ fl@@ ab@@ or medicine , for example with snor@@ ing with respiratory diseases or if you don &apos;t find the cause of a sleeping troub@@ les , Fi@@ etz@@ e explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; just don &apos;t make any mid@@ day sleep &quot; says Fi@@ etz@@ e .
after the wired you go to bed at his normal time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the electrodes in the body one we@@ ars a s@@ ung@@ lasses , a chest strap and a feel@@ ers on the finger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also distingu@@ ishes a camera on the ceiling .
how do people get the grip on in the handle ?
there are quite many adjusting screws to which you can sit for a better sleep .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We@@ eks is based on : regular sleeping and stop @-@ times , not to sleep long in bed , don &apos;t stop watching television or sleep at night - then one begins to count on the clock , and that is quite and certainly not eligible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what the jungle camp with lack of medals in swimming
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has expressed itself on Facebook to dis@@ appo@@ inting the DS@@ V team in Olymp@@ is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in December 2014 , he captured gold for the first time in Doha and presented his first record record at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ lete Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has been protected from Facebook to his criticism of the ex @-@ team @-@ mates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic champion would get 20,000 € bonus and one jungle . one lap one should be wonder@@ ing about missing medals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 26 @-@ year @-@ old at night on his Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conveying system in the swimming pool is poor that dop@@ ing@@ controls are very good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , we can &apos;t compete with countries which promote very much and do not even monitor the theme of D@@ oping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that here the controls are to be set . &quot; he explained further .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wanted to start a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler had to be reported nine months before his first start to the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is exactly that way you should keep it with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who do not receive a certain time prior to WM / OS by independent controllers from the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A , is allowed to take part , &quot; says the choice @-@ ham@@ bur@@ gers which operates an ice cream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de of Lu@@ qu@@ ads arrested
professional thi@@ eves at the Düsseldorf airport
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police operated the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the susp@@ ects were committed as a ban@@ dage of multiple bags and luggage ste@@ els .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against 21.@@ 30 a.m. civil servants reported a gang in Düsseldorf at the airport Düsseldorf , which was known by the polic@@ emen from theft @-@ theft . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two women and two men had committed several del@@ ines since the mid @-@ July and were collabor@@ ative , working and particularly professional . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Speci@@ alists of Crime @-@ Com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ats 34 can have left the thi@@ eves , which were specifically designed for off@@ ing criminal off@@ ences to Germany , four deeds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a total of over 15,000 Euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; old buildings , a couple of Lin@@ den@@ d@@ anders , in between still a remainder of cob@@ bled streets : the Rig@@ a@@ er street in Berlin @-@ Fried@@ rich@@ sha@@ in appears at first sight , but the police over@@ looks the &quot; dangerous locations &quot; of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; walk along the west from east to west , one gets to play@@ grounds , a fresh@@ kn@@ itted kinder@@ garten and a be@@ ad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
someone has &quot; ugly &quot; to the facade of a gray house ! &quot; spra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opposite to a Li@@ dl , which will soon be demolished , is already built : by 2017 there will be a house with high windows and 133 new apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; fashionable district , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Fried@@ rich@@ sha@@ in calls , are mainly illustrated with burning cars over the past few weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rented apartments , but on the ground floor , there are still room occupied and are used for events . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the year since the beginning of the year , the German internal sen@@ ator had been pronounced against the project as a &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after three weeks had been granted the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ c@@ smith , with 300 police officers , three weeks long official statements according to the ground and three teams left off to enter the house with the number 94 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the renovated building workers on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners the rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Administ@@ rative Court decided that the clearance was illegal , and one day later the police and building workers moved under the che@@ ers of sympath@@ ies and investors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this summer afternoon the street looks peaceful : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others keep themselves early late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the immediate vicinity of the building projects are a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ sti@@ n Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the neighbourhood , and J@@ ana * who here has three children , are mainly generated by the police presence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the residents of the Hau@@ projects they share the concern of rising and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a neighborhood that is mostly intended for a majority of pol@@ ishing on the left .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ditch , one of the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police between owners and their neighbours , does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fried@@ rich@@ sha@@ in in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working class , which also has a low average income in comparison to the rest of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also domestic projects and home @-@ born residence projects have long been part of the neighbourhood as well : in 1990 numerous houses were occupied by former GDR , including nearly the entire main@@ tain@@ er street near the Rig@@ a@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the main@@ tain@@ er had been swe@@ pt away under regular police rule , many of the projects in the Rig@@ a@@ er have been leg@@ alized and partly occupied by people who had occupied since 26 years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , the neighborhood has become increasingly popular for tourists and elec@@ oms for tourists from all over the world : with them there are now residents of GDR and former home owners to share their neighbourhood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also noticeable in the rentals , which has increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : one can recognize them in raised discs or freshly painted fac@@ ades , which have filled with color @-@ exploited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other road was mentioned this year so often together with the words &quot; left autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one reason why not all neighbors should look at this as a problem , criminal off@@ ences are not necessarily affected by crime . according to criminal off@@ ences they are almost exclusively opposed to polic@@ emen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest part of off@@ ences make off@@ ense , the ten@@ den@@ te rather re@@ build and newly renovated houses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Ker@@ sti@@ n Neu@@ geb@@ auer , which resi@@ des 17 years in a lease house next to the controversial 94 , there may be no talk of uncertainty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of violence , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours , which don &apos;t have been . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the famous lit cars will also place it longer in the Rig@@ a@@ er longer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the studied architecture , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the road and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has been aware of the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße - and remained .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , it was also so important that residents will get back their road : from the police , politics and media , which all suddenly claims the interpre@@ ting of the districts in July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the eyes of the inhabitants as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to get away : through fear of new buildings in former building g@@ aps that boun@@ ce the ancient inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are of course ownership dwellings , which are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction can I absolutely not eat . &quot;
but what can we do if a man has never heard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there on all sides of fru@@ stration , also with the police and the inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for dig@@ gers who anno@@ yed themselves about colour bomb , Ker@@ sti@@ n Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the neighbourhood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who passes , should be aware of it - just like anyone who attracts in a pub area , compla@@ in about noise about noise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all persons described only with the first names were asked , not to be called by their proper name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee commissioned
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker in front of that .
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le joined the refugee commissioned for Ur@@ bach .
social pedag@@ og@@ in supports the team of Administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it sees itself as contact for all players : refugees , working group assistance , administration , authorities and who else even ming@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine client interpreted by working group , that the honorary bodies are more than grateful that Deu@@ ter@@ le is now there , who has become a problem in particular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , some - less spot@@ less than rather looking at a large variety of tasks - meant , as the management wanted to write down the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people , associated with many years of experience in the field of social work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but administration work is not their central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; above all , it is organization , work with the people on the spot and behind the scenes and network activities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been doing so for about six weeks .
it has fixed a 50 percent spot on three years .
&quot; it was high time &quot; says Reg@@ ine client that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le hon@@ our@@ able and full @-@ time players supported .
there are large and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems .
soon there are new containers in Was@@ en@@ straße
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a serious problem has been found for some time , flats for the connecting policy , which have been recognized . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the commun@@ es are responsible for connecting cables .
they have to accommodate refugees in their own or hired living rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the costs for building , rent or renov@@ ations of these accommodations must carry the commun@@ es itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the responsibility is alter@@ n@@ ated by the council Office on Commun@@ e and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search is quite difficult for some time .
de facto the board does not find private apartments .
so far it is not working if one needs to be instruc@@ ted on private apartments so Deu@@ ces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , community apartments must be renewed as it is so beautiful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so soon new containers will be placed in the water@@ way .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword which are Reg@@ ine client and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to a fixed lead , it is plac@@ ements , training places , one @-@ euro jobs and support activities for refugees and migrants who have to be spotted or set up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more places would be good &quot; &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many work in the building yard or help house lovers , do not get char@@ itable work , and that &apos;s motivated and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she hopes that the work is leading to a positive external action .
that is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but he does not only mean work .
the day need a solid structure , say Deu@@ ter@@ le and customer .
the people would have to develop a fe@@ asi@@ bility feeling .
so there are offers as sport , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are ra@@ r .
so also visit management and community offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was central that the refugees got the feeling , they are desired in Germany and welcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need to explain the refugees that it just takes , and you can bridge the time to bridge it , for example with language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who eventually develop the feeling , he could not work in Ur@@ bach , could not work and be useless , I will never integrate himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the considerable majority was motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there are problems , however , it says hon@@ estly , &quot; people where nothing is about . &quot; the work of Deu@@ z@@ le and Customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ o task . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a difficult question : did they fear radic@@ alization of radic@@ alization , even in a small village like Ur@@ bach ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; Reg@@ ine Customer says clearly to call &quot; what is native na@@ i@@ ve &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are too sensitive .
these inci@@ dents may also be subject to refugees .
they would have the fear that the attacks did not bring them into ob@@ itu@@ ary .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so basic and honorary in the area and in the region have to look out for activities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they always have in the background , that soon a new deposit of refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does Germany need a ceiling ?
to answer this question to answer the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually , it is un@@ fair to put them on site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have not arrived in Ur@@ bach where we would like to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no new refugees that would relax .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine client also makes clear that the Ur@@ g@@ bacher have already tou@@ red with it , to integrate the previous people sensible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when people are in need , one ought to help them , both women are lonely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political world situation is so complicated there is no easy answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ar with helicop@@ ters sought
the police helicopter flew several areas approximately one hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men are on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 o &apos;clock in a apartment in a multi @-@ family house in Lin@@ den@@ weg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people surprised the two , and struck the innocent in the escape . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two men were about 1,@@ 65 to 1,@@ 70 meters large , probably mas@@ ked , both Blue@@ je@@ ans and black hoo@@ ded pul@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were taken in the direction of the city .
the police put several stri@@ kers and a police helicopter .
the crossing went out without success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the unknown before the fact , close to the apartment or by their escape . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Baden @-@ Württemberg : police determined after ro@@ cker attack on I@@ mb@@ iss
