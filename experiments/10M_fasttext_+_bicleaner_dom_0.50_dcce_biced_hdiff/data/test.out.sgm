<seg id="11">"" "" "" "therefore, taxes would be increased to the rich, says it." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="23">TPP and the transit-fish trade deal will both not sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "at the same time, both of them want to isolate the United States from international trade - just American jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">They should then be paid even better than the Clinton demands.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a starvation.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "what trump is going to do in this question is not quite clear: once, he says, the minimum wage must fall, then he says he must not be changed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the upcoming months should probably be likely to develop the tax policy of both camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "on the one hand stands trump, who wants to lieve the economy and citizens to boost growth." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "his critics cling to him, that the budget deficit would be even greater." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="13">These files encrypts the ransomware and deletes the originals.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software will then be presenting the demands of the blackmailers.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "to get the end-key code to the files, the victim must pay money - usually in the form of the Crypt Bitcoin." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of the companies "IT-leaders in the Malwarebytes Survey trust you to get ransomware by file-back-ups and scannersoftware.</seg>

<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker in front of that.</seg>

<seg id="8">"" "" "" "thus, some - less spotless than rather looking at a large variety of tasks - meant, as the management wanted to write down the place." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "we were looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people, associated with many years of experience in the field of social work." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">But administration work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "above all, it is organization, work with the people on the spot and behind the scenes and network activities." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been doing so for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has fixed a 50 percent spot on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time" says Regine client that Annika Deuschle honourable and full-time players supported.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon there are new containers in Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "a serious problem has been found for some time, flats for the connecting policy, which have been recognized." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="20">"" "" "" "the costs for building, rent or renovations of these accommodations must carry the communes itself." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility is alternated by the council Office on Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search is quite difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto the board does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far it is not working if one needs to be instructed on private apartments so Deuces.</seg>
<seg id="26">"" "" "" "therefore, community apartments must be renewed as it is so beautiful." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be placed in the waterway.</seg>

<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword which are Regine client and Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "in addition to a fixed lead, it is placements, training places, one-euro jobs and support activities for refugees and migrants who have to be spotted or set up." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="36">The day need a solid structure, say Deuterle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">The people would have to develop a feasibility feeling.</seg>
<seg id="38">So there are offers as sport, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also visit management and community offices.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "it was central that the refugees got the feeling, they are desired in Germany and welcome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>

<seg id="44">"" "" "" "those who eventually develop the feeling, he could not work in Urbach, could not work and be useless, I will never integrate himself." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The considerable majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "" "" "but there are problems, however, it says honestly," people where nothing is about. "the work of Deuzle and Customer is therefore always to motivate others." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoto task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"" "" "" "a difficult question: did they fear radicalization of radicalization, even in a small village like Urbach?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="49">"no" "" "" "no," Regine Customer says clearly to call "what is native naive". "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are too sensitive.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents may also be subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the attacks did not bring them into obituary.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Customer. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So basic and honorary in the area and in the region have to look out for activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "they always have in the background, that soon a new deposit of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a ceiling?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question to answer the policy.</seg>
<seg id="59">"" "" "" "actually, it is unfair to put them on site." "" "" ""</seg>
